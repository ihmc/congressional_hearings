"Mr. Graves","Thank you, Madam Chair, and I would like to thank you for holding this important hearing on the debate that is going to occur about restructuring the regulatory oversight of America's financial sector. Given the fact that the financial services sector contributed more than a third of corporate profits in this country during the last decade, it is a significant debate. No one can question that the events affecting Wall Street last year had consequences on the overall American economy. Once credit becomes unavailable, the modern economy comes to a grinding halt. Consumers and businesses do not buy, manufacturers do not sell, and unemployment skyrockets. Any reform to the financial regulatory process must meet two key objectives. First, it must provide for an efficient operation of the financial markets; and second, small businesses, the prime generator of new jobs in the economy, must have access to capital. Competitive markets need full information to operate properly. To the extent that regulatory reform improves the information available to all parties that use the financial markets, it will be beneficial. That benefit must be weighed against the cost of providing information. Much of the focus on financial regulatory reform proposals address either protecting consumers or preventing one or a group of institutions from creating systemic risk leading to the collapse of capital and the credit markets. However, little has been said on the impact that such regulatory oversight might have on the access to capital for small businesses. If the regulatory reform inhibits the ability of small businesses to obtain credit or access needed capital, the regulation will have an adverse long-term consequence on the ability of the economy to grow. A famous philosopher once said that "Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it." Whatever the outcome of the debate on restructuring the regulation of the financial sector, we cannot repeat the mistakes of the past. Given the fact that financial panics have periodically occurred in this country going back to 1837, achieving a regulatory restructuring that ensures Congress does not repeat the mistakes of the past will be one of our most difficult tasks. I again would like to thank the Chairwoman for holding this important hearing, and I yield back. Chairwoman Velazquez. Now I welcome Mr. Robert Harris, the Managing Director of Harris, Cotherman, Jones, Price & Associates in Vero Beach, Florida. He is also the Vice Chair for the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the national professional association of certified public accountants. The AICPA has more than 330,000 members. Welcome, sir. And you have 5 minutes to make your statement.",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, members of the committee. My name is Robert R. Harris and I am Vice Chairman with the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. I am a CPA and a partner in the CPA firm of Harris, Cotherman, Jones, Price & Associates. We are located in Vero Beach, Florida, and are a small firm with 11 CPAs. My firm's clients are primarily small businesses and individuals. We do financial planning and tax service for most of these clients. I am here today representing the American Institute of CPAs. AICPA is the national professional association of CPAs with more than 360,000 CPA members in business, industry, public practice, government, education, student affiliates, and international associates. As a result of the economic crisis precipitated by the subprime lending, the administration and Congress felt that financial regulatory restructuring was necessary. The administration called for a new regulatory scheme that encompasses strong vibrant financial markets operating under transparent fairly administered rules that protect America's consumers and our economy from the devastating breakdown that we have witnessed in recent years. The administration also said that to accomplish this goal it would be necessary to seek a careful balance that will allow our markets to promote innovation while discouraging abuse. To this end, Congress is looking at a number of financial activities with an eye towards how to appropriately and adequately regulate those activities. The AICPA supports the goal of enhanced consumer protection, but we believe that it is critical to consider the plan's effect on small business to ensure that it does not stifle the innovation, creativity and inventiveness of the American entrepreneur that has driven our economic engine. In this context, I would like to discuss The Consumer Financial Protection Act of 2009, H.R. 3126, which would create the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, or CFPA, and its effect on small business from the point of view of a CPA. The stated aim of the consumer protection bill is to protect consumers by consolidating financial consumer protection in one agency. This would be a safeguard against consumers getting inappropriate loans that they could not afford repay. But the bill is much broader than protecting consumers when they borrow money. The CFPA, as introduced, would cover most CPAs because its scope of authority includes tax return preparation, tax advice, financial planning, and pro bono financial literacy activities. The accounting profession's pro bono financial literacy programs, "360 Degrees of Financial Literacy" and FeedthePig.org, which are designed to teach consumers and young people how to make smart decisions would be covered by the bill. Our own Lisa Baskfield, a CPA from Minnesota, was recently awarded the civilian service medal for providing pro bono financial access to more than 2,000 armed services members. Her advice would have been covered under this bill. Many of the members are affiliated with CPA firms that are small businesses and will be adversely affected by the bill, and many of their clients are small businesses, sole proprietorships and partnerships. It is impossible to separate the advice and tax service given to these small businesses from the advice and tax services given to the owners. They both are covered by the bill--thus, both would be covered by this bill. Additionally, any person who provides a material service to a covered person such as a financial institution is included in the definition of a covered person. My practice of forensic accounting would subject me to the CFPA when I do a financial audit of a lender making consumer loans even though I do not have direct dealings with the consumers and provide no services to consumers. As a CPA, I can tell you that CPAs are heavily and effectively regulated by three sources. State boards of accountancy, the Internal Revenue Service, and the AICPA. This regulatory structure protects consumers first with the first rule being, service the public interest. The bill consolidates the enforcement of a number of Federal consumer protection laws into one Federal agency; however, it adds another layer of regulation to the accounting profession without consolidating any of our regulation. This regulation would be costly because the assessment that would be levied by CFPA, and it will take significant time from our ability to serve our clients because we would be subject to periodic examinations by the agency. These are all costs that will ultimately be borne by our clients, the very consumers that this bill is supposed to protect. And it will do so without any commensurate benefit. CPAs are asking for an exemption only for the customary and usual CPA services and volunteer or pro bono financial education activities. We are not asking for an exemption when CPAs are offering consumer financial products, such as a loan or investment products. In fact, areas of potential abuse, such as refund anticipation loans, are covered by other provisions of the bill. We are encouraged by recent press reports that Chairman Frank is considering exempting professional services from the reach of the bill. We appreciate the opportunity to testify today on the impact of the bill that will have effect on thousands of CPA firms that are small businesses and their clients, many of whom are also small business. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you Mr. Harris. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness, Mr. Trevor Loy, is a venture capital investor in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Mr. Loy is testifying on behalf of the National Venture Capital Association, which represents the U.S. venture capital industry and is comprised of more than 450 member firms.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ROBERT R. HARRIS
"Mr. Loy","Thank you, Chairman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to be part of this important discussion today. I would like to begin by talking about risk and the difference between entrepreneurial risk and systemic financial risk. Entrepreneurial risk involves making calculated and informed bets on people and innovation and is critical to building small businesses. Systemic financial risk involves a series of complex financial interdependencies between parties and counterparties operating in the public markets. The venture industry and the small business community are heavily dependent on embracing entrepreneurial risk, but we have virtually no involvement in systemic risk. Let me explain why. The venture capital industry is simple. We invest in privately held small businesses created and run by entrepreneurs. These entrepreneurs grow the business using their own personal funds as well as the capital from ourselves and our outside investors, known as LPs or limited partners. We invest cash in these small businesses to purchase equity, i.e., stock, and we then work closely alongside the entrepreneurs on a weekly basis for 5 to 10 years until the company is sold or goes public. When the company has grown enough so that it can be sold or taken public, the VC exits our investment in the company and the proceeds are distributed back to our investors in our funds. When we are not successful, we lose the money we invested, but that loss does not extend to anyone else beyond our investors. Even when we lose money on investments, it does not happen suddenly or unexpectedly. It takes us several years to lose money and the investors in our funds all understand that time frame and the risk when they sign up. Debt, known as leverage, which contributed to the financial meltdown, is not part of our equation. We work simply with cash and with equity. We do not use debt to make investments or to increase the capacity of the fund. Without debt or derivatives or securitization or swaps or other complex financial instruments, we don't expose any party to losses in excess of their committed capital. In our world, the total potential loss from a million dollar investment is limited to a million dollars. There is no multiplier effect because there are no side bets, unmonitored securities, or derivatives traded, based on our transactions. There are no counterparties tied to our investments. Nor are venture firms interdependent with the world's financial system. We do not trade in the public markets and our investors cannot withdraw capital during the 10-year life of a fund, nor can they publicly trade their partnership interest in the fund. The venture capital industry is also much smaller than most people realize. In 2008, U.S. venture capital funds held approximately $200 billion in aggregate assets and invested just $28 billion into start-up companies. That is less than 0.2 percent of the U.S. gross domestic product. Yet, over 40 years, this model has been a tremendous force in U.S. economic growth, building industries like biotech, semiconductor and software. Now we are increasingly helping to build renewable energy and other green-tech sectors. Companies that were started with venture capital since 1970 today account for 12.1 million jobs and $2.9 trillion in revenues in the U.S. That is nearly 21 percent of the U.S. GDP, but it grew from our investments of less than 0.2 percent of GDP. My main point, therefore, is that harming our industry will prevent a major part of the future American economy from growing out of businesses that are today's small businesses; and that is the risk that you should be concerned about. Now, we do recognize the legitimate need for transparency and we simply ask that you customize the regulatory approach to fit what we do. Today, VCs already provide information to the SEC. That information, submitted on what is called Form D, should already be sufficient to determine the lack of systemic risk from venture capital firms. This filing process could easily be enhanced to include information that would provide greater comfort to our regulators. An enhanced Form D--let's call it Form D-2, could answer questions on our use of leverage, trading positions, and counterparty obligations, allowing regulators to then exempt from additional regulatory burdens firms like ours that don't engage in those activities and, therefore, don't pose systemic risks. In contrast, formally registering as investment advisers under the current act, as the current proposals require, has significant burdens without any additional benefits. And let me be clear, registering as an advisor with the SEC is far from simple, and it is not just filling out a form. The word "registration" in that context might sound like registering your vehicle, telling the motor vehicle department what kind of car it is and who you are and where you live. It might conjure up images of things like smog checks and our proposal for the Form D-2 is equivalent to that. But actually the word "registration" in the SEC context comes with a lot of other requirements. To continue my analogy with your car, it is equivalent to having to hire a full-time driver, plus a compliance officer who rides in the front seat to make sure that driver is operating the car correctly, plus a mechanic who lives at your house to fix the car and works only on your car, plus providing the government with information about every place you drive. Moving back to the actual world of SEC registration involving examinations, complex programs overseen by a mandatory compliance officer, it will demand significant resources which promise to be costly from both a financial and human resources perspective. My own firm believes it will be one-third of our entire annual budget. Your support has not gone unnoticed by us and we appreciate it. We cannot afford another situation where the unintended consequences of well-intentioned regulation harms small businesses and the economic growth that we drive. We look forward to working with the committee on that goal. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Loy. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Mr. David Hirschmann. He is the President and CEO of the Center for Capital Markets Competitiveness in the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce is the world's largest business federation, representing 3 million businesses. Welcome.",Statement,STATEMENT OF TREVOR LOY
"Mr. Hirschmann","Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, members of the committee. I really think this is a very timely hearing. Today, what I would like to do is talk specifically about an issue of great concern to many of our members, especially our small business members, the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency. The U.S. Chamber supports the goal of enhancing consumer protection. In fact, the Capital Markets Center that I run was founded 3 years ago before the financial crisis to advocate for comprehensive reform and modernization of our regulatory structure, including strong consumer protection. Consumers, including small businesses, need reforms that will ensure clear disclosure, better information; they need vigorous enforcement against predatory practices and other consumer frauds, and we need to close the gaps in current regulation. However, the proposed Consumer Protection Agency is the wrong way to enhance protections. It will have significant unintended consequences for consumers, small businesses, and for the overall economy. Today, the Chamber will release a study that examines the impact of CFPA on small business access to credit. The study is authored by Thomas Durkin, an economist who spent more than 20 years at the Federal Reserve Board. My remarks draw on the findings of that study to make the following points. Small businesses, including those that we traditionally count on to be the first to add jobs in the early stages of an economic recovery, need access to credit to survive, meet expenses, and grow. Small businesses often have difficulty obtaining commercial credit and, therefore, turn to consumer credit and consumer financial products to supplement their short-term capital needs. The CFPA will reduce the availability and increase the costs of consumer credit. As users of consumer credit products, small businesses will see the same result despite being fundamentally different than the average consumer. The proposed CFPA will likely restrict, and in many cases eliminate, small business access to credit and increase the cost of credit they would be able to obtain. This CFPA "credit squeeze" could result in business closures, fewer start-ups, and slower growth, ultimately costing a significant number of jobs that would be lost or simply not created. Finally, the CFPA will only exacerbate the weaknesses of our current regulatory system without enhancing consumer protections. In 2006, 800,000 businesses created new jobs in this country; 642,000 of them had fewer than 20 employees. Small businesses generally have trouble borrowing money. Either they can't borrow or they cannot borrow as much as they need, and almost certainly they cannot secure long-term financing available to larger companies. To supplement the reduced access to traditional loans, small businesses rely extensively on consumer lending products, and they use them as a source of credit very differently than consumers. In other words, personal credit is the lifeline that sustains small businesses, particularly start-ups. Many of the products that small businesses rely on may be considered to some as fringe products, but they are the very products that small business owners use to meet their short- term capital needs. As one example, auto title loans provide small business owners immediate access to cash and no upfront fees or prepayment penalties, and therefore can be useful meeting short-term business expense. However, the CFPA in its approach failed to recognize the difference between small businesses and average consumers both in terms of need and sophistication and their appetite for risk. As proposed, the CFPA will likely reduce the availability of these products and increase their costs. It will make it harder for financial firms to meet the needs of small businesses. The CFPA will create considerable new risks to lenders in terms of regulatory fines and litigation risks from extending credit to small businesses. H.R. 3126 is the wrong approach. It simply adds a new government agency on top of an already flawed regulatory structure. As one example, rather than streamline consumer protections to eliminate gaps, regulatory arbitration, and create uniform national standards for key issues like disclosure, the legislation would foster a complex and confusing patchwork of 51-plus States regulation in addition to new Federal rules. As we begin to see signs of economic recovery, we need to be especially careful to fully understand the impact of a new regulatory layer on small businesses, both as consumers and as providers of financial products. We look forward to working with the members of the committee on the modernization of our regulatory structure and appreciate your holding this hearing today. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Hirschmann. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Mr. Mike Anderson. He is the President of the Essential Mortgage Company in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Mr. Anderson is a 30-year veteran in the mortgage industry. He is testifying on behalf of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers, which represents the interests of mortgage brokers and home buyers.",Statement,STATEMENT OF DAVID T. HIRSCHMANN
"Mr. Anderson","Thank you. I have a little opening statement: Small businesses in the financial service arena are under tremendous risk and we need your help. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Graves and members of the committee. I am Mike Anderson. I am a Certified Residential Mortgage Specialist and Vice Chairman of the Government Affairs Committee of the National Association of Mortgage Brokers. I am also a practicing mortgage broker in the State of Louisiana, with over 30 years of experience. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify today. We applaud this committee's response to the current problems in our financial markets. We share a resolute commitment to a simpler, clearer, more uniform and valid approach relative to financial products, most specifically with regard to obtaining mortgages and to protecting consumers throughout the process. NAMB has several areas of concern with the CFPA. It is impossible to have one large agency develop and maintain comprehensive consumer protections. Consumer protection needs to exist at the State level, closer to the consumers. As proposed, the CFPA will favor big business. It will choose winners and losers, and the losers will be the small businesses and consumers. Before I address our overall concerns, I must first extinguish the false allegations targeted at mortgage brokers for many years. First of all, brokers do not create loan products. We do not underwrite the loan or approve the borrower for the loan. We do not fund the loan. We provide consumers with an array of choices and permit them to choose the loan payments that fit their particular needs and to provide an on- time closing. We are regulated. State-regulated mortgage brokers and lenders comply with State and Federal consumer protection laws, including State predatory lending laws. Federally chartered banks are preempted from these predatory lending laws. And lastly, we did not receive any TARP funds. The typical mortgage broker of today exists as an origination channel for consumers who wish to purchase or refinance their home. Mortgage brokers typically employ anywhere from 2 to 50 people, and they serve communities big and small, urban and rural in all 50 States, truly classifying them as a valuable small business entity. In order for the CFPA to be effective, it must act prudently when promulgating and enforcing rules to ensure that real protections are afforded to consumers and not merely provide the illusion of protection that comes from incomplete or unequal regulation of similar products services or providers, whereas financial reform is to provide transparency, clarity, simplicity, accountability, and access in the market for consumer financial products and to ensure the markets operate fairly and efficiently. It is imperative that the creation of new disclosures or the revision of the antiquated disclosures be achieved through an effective and even-handed approach and consumer testing. It is not the who, but the what that must be addressed to ensure true consumer protection and success with this initiative. There should be no exemptions from consumer protections whether the CFPA is created or not. The Federal Government should not--and I repeat, should not--pick winners and losers, which is where we believe the Federal reform is heading. We are very supportive of the concepts of the proposed single, integrated model disclosure for mortgage transactions that combine those currently under TILA and RESPA. Consumers will greatly benefit from a uniform disclosure that clearly and simply explains critical loan terms and costs. Therefore, NAMB strongly encourages this committee to consider imposing a moratorium on the implementation of any new regulations or disclosures issued by HUD and the Federal Reserve Board for at least a year until financial modernization has become law. This will help to avoid consumer confusion and minimize the increased cost and the unnecessary burden borne by industry participants to manage and administer multiple significant changes to the mandatory disclosures over a short period of time. NAMB strongly supports the concept of mandating a comprehensive review of the new and existing regulations, including the Home Value Code of Conduct, the HVCC. Too often in the wake of our current official crisis we have seen new rules promulgated that do not effect measured balance and effective solutions to the problems facing our markets and consumers-- Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Anderson, time has expired. You will have an opportunity during the question-and-answer period.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MIKE ANDERSON, CRMS
"Mr. Anderson","Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Mr. J. Douglas Robinson. He is the Chairman and CEO of Utica National Insurance Group in New Hartford, New York. Utica National is among the top 100 property casualty insurance organizations in the country. He is testifying on behalf of the Property Casualty Insurers of American, which has over 1,000 members.",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. I am J. Douglas Robinson, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the Utica National Insurance Group, a group led by two mutual insurers headquartered near Utica, New York. Utica National provides coverages primarily for individual and commercial risks with an emphasis on specialized markets, including public and private schools, religious institutions, small contractors, and printers. My company markets its products through approximately 1,200 independent agents and brokers. Our 2008 direct written premiums were more than $632 million. I am testifying today on behalf of the Property Casualty Insurers Association of America, which represents more than 1,000 U.S. insurers. We commend President Obama and Congress for working to ensure that the financial crisis we experienced last fall is never repeated. Achieving this goal requires a focus on fixing what went wrong with Wall Street without imposing substantial new one-size-fits-all regulatory burdens on Main Street, small businesses, and activities that are not highly leveraged nor systemically risky. My company insures small businesses like bakeries, child care centers, auto service centers, and funeral homes. These Main Street businesses should not bear the burden of an economic crisis they did not create. Home, auto, and commercial insurers did not cause the financial crisis, are not systemically risky and have strong and effective solvency and consumer protection regulation at the State level. We are predominantly a Main Street, not a Wall Street, industry with less concentration and more small business competition than other sectors. Property casualty insurers have not asked for government handouts. Our industry is stable and continues to provide critical services to local economies and communities. However, small insurers are concerned about being subject to administration proposals intended to address risky Wall Street banks and securities firms, but that apply broadly to the entire financial industry. Specifically, we are concerned about the following: The proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency does not adequately exclude insurance from its scope. An exclusion should be added for credit, title, and mortgage insurance, which are generally provided by and to relatively small businesses. Protection should be added for insurance payment plans which are already well regulated by State insurance departments. The proposed new Office of National Insurance is given too much subpoena and preemption power without adequate due process or limits on its scope and its ability to enter into international insurance agreements. It also needs a definition of "small insurer" to prevent excessive reporting requirements. Systemic risk regulation needs to be modified to reduce government backing of large firms at the competitive expense of small financial providers. Leveraged Wall Street behemoths must not be made bigger through government bailouts and consolidation. Government shouldn't forget or harm Main Street in addressing systemic risk regulation. Resolution costs of systemically risky firms should be paid for by firms with the greatest systemic risk. Bank regulators should not be allowed to resolve systemic risk failures by reaching into the assets of small insurance affiliates whose losses would then be charged to other innocent small competitors through State guaranty funds. Finally, congressionally proposed repeal of the McCarran- Ferguson Act would significantly reduce insurance competition, primarily harming smaller insurers that would not otherwise have access to loss data and uniform policy forms necessary to compete effectively, and that would ultimately harm consumers. The cost of new regulations almost always disproportionately affects small business who can least afford the necessary legal and compliance requirements. The property casualty industry is healthy and competitive and the current system of regulating the industry at the State level is working well. Should the Congress fail to address the issues we have identified, the consequences on consumers and the economy could be quite harsh, imposing an especially large burden on small insurers and small businesses. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Robinson. Chairwoman Velazquez. And we have four votes right now, so the committee will stand in recess for approximately 30 minutes and will reconvene right after. Chairwoman Velazquez. The committee is called to order. I want to address my first question to Mr. Hirschmann, Mr. Harris, and Mr. Anderson. In determining the impact of a new consumer protection authority, structure and details are key. For example, the manner in which the term "credit provider" is defined will be especially critical. So how can Congress define these terms in a way that minimizes the impact for small businesses? Mr. Hirschmann?",Statement,STATEMENT OF J. DOUGLAS ROBINSON
"Mr. Hirschmann","I think you are exactly right. Both the scope of the bill, as originally drafted--and we recognize that Chairman Frank has indicated that he is working on that issue-- as well as the terms. Many of the key terms were so ill defined and the powers that were granted to the proposed agency are so significant that it really leaves that up to the new regulator to decide; and we can't afford to do that. So I don't have an answer for you on how to specifically define credit, but clearly you need to target it to the specific firms that are providing direct credit and not indirectly to those who are providing material support or indirectly the way the original bill contemplated. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Harris.",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","I would concur with that. We were providing a service or even those who are providing a trade or business that is not just purely loaning of money is where we would get into it. I mean, I cannot think of one client I have--virtually, other than a restaurant--that would not be one who does not provide credit of some sort. A doctor's office--and doctors' offices even for people who are on Medicare, you have copays; and the copays are billed to those people after they have seen the doctor. So then the doctors have substantial accounts receivable. Are they credit providers? I don't think that was ever the intent. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Anderson?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","I guess we really have to define who is the creditor on behalf of the mortgage brokers. I mean, we are truly not the creditor, and yet we do perform a function, taking loan applications from applicants and explaining loan terms and giving them disclosures. So until we define who really is the creditor, that is all I can answer on that. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Hirschmann, Mr. Harris, the financial crisis wreaked havoc on consumers. We all know that. And to that end, several Members of the House, including Representative Minnick, are proposing an alternative consumer protection council, one that will coordinate regulatory actions across several State jurisdictions. What is your take on this idea?",Speech,
"Mr. Hirschmann","We have not yet seen the details, but we do think that consumer protection should be an important part of the overall regulatory reform; and so we welcome alternatives, particularly alternatives that build on the current structure that requires better coordination among existing regulators, that provide for better disclosure to consumers and tougher enforcement against predatory practices.",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","I think AICPA would concur with that. We are talking about in our area--of course, we believe that products should be in and certain services should be out. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Loy, in your testimony you touch on the distinction between hedge funds and venture capitalists. Given the role that hedge funds play in this debate, can you elaborate on that distinction and talk about differences about how VCs and hedge funds should be regulated?",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","Thank you. So I think I would begin by saying it is easier to define it by what is similar. There is really only one similarity between a hedge fund and a venture capital fund, and that is the legal structure that we use. We typically are organized as limited partnerships and they are typically organized as limited partnerships and the investors become the limited partners. Beyond that, hedge funds are associated with trading in the public markets. They typically--in addition to the capital that investors put into the hedge fund, they borrow, in other words, they use leverage, several multiples of that capital that the investors have put in, to make a broader set of investments. They often invest for fairly short periods of time, and I know that can range based on their strategy. But it can be as short as a few hours, typically in the days or weeks; some hedge funds may be for a few months. And so they are also bringing the capital in up front from the investors and the investors have the ability typically to pull their money in and out. And then, lastly, a lot of hedge funds particularly trade in these off-balance-sheet securities, derivatives. Beyond that, I would be clear to say that I not an expert on hedge funds, so I am not going to comment on how they should be or should not be regulated. But what I will comment on is for venture capitalists. We use the same legal structure, but the similarities end there. Our investors put money in as limited partners, but do not have the ability to take money out for 10 years. We do not use leverage at all, so the money that investors put in our fund in cash is the money that we have available. On top of that we invest only in stock, not in credit. We expect each investment we make to hold that investment for 5 to 10 years. And the last difference is that we work very closely operationally with the businesses, the small businesses, to help them grow. Hedge funds, I think, more typically have a distance between them in that regard. So all I can say is that the current advisor act in the contemplated regulations for hedge funds are clearly designed for hedge funds and, for example, require a compliance officer in a firm to report periodically on the public market trading positions of that hedge fund. If we were to be--right now we are encompassed in the same regulation--we would similarly be required to hire a chief compliance officer to tell the SEC about our public market trading positions, even though our fund agreements do not even allow us to trade in the public market. So this very expensive person would sit there and fill out a form that said zero or N/ A every month. Chairwoman Velazquez. But in the sense that hedge funds borrow big money and try to exploit inefficiencies in the market, wouldn't you say that there is an element of risk that we don't see in venture capitalists?",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","Again, I would rather comment on the venture capital piece. Chairwoman Velazquez. Can we touch on the private equity firms?",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","Sure. Chairwoman Velazquez. They are another unique financial entity. Do you have any position as to how they should be regulated?",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","I don't. I think that that is up to the expertise of the people on this and other committees. I do think that there are substantial differences in the types of investing and the types of leverage that they use. Again, they use the same legal structure as us, but there are significant differences beyond that. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thanks. Mr. Harris, in your testimony, you said that CPAs should be--should not be exempt from activities that are not customary and usual. And the vagueness of the phrase "not customary and usual" could create the exact kind of problems that you are seeking to avoid. How do you recommend that legislators implement this distinction?",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","CPAs have a very close relationship with their clients, and there are a lot of questions that go back and forth on a routine basis. And so many of these are small clients and they rely upon us for all kinds of advice, both tax advice for the company and the individual. When I am talking with a doctor who happens to be set up in a form--an entity which is a partnership or a PA, I can't help but talk to him about both at the same time. That is where our biggest problem is. Where we believe that CPAs should come under the act would be when they are involved in selling some form of a product. So, for instance, my client comes to me and says, I need some help. We say we believe you need a loan and we recommend that you go to the bank and talk to the bank. That would be exempt. However, if we said, But by the way, we will make you that loan, in that case we should come under the act, where there is a product involved. Chairwoman Velazquez. Can we use like the example of H&R Block?",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","Who are not CPAs? Yes. Chairwoman Velazquez. But they do accounting. And also they make refund anticipation loans. So that part should be regulated.",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","We totally agree with that, and if there is a CPA doing that, we believe that is a product and, in fact, should be regulated. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Graves.",Speech,
"Mr. Graves","In all the debate, when it came to the bailouts and everything that took place, we had a lot of talk about financial institutions being too big to fail. And my question to each of you is there--in our capitalist society, such a thing as an institution that is too big to fail? And if one of the very large financial institutions did fail, how would that affect you or your business or your clients, whatever the case may be? Mr. Harris?",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","I have listened quite a bit to Mr. Geithner and Mr. Bernanke on that issue, and I happen to concur with them. There are some institutions which are too big to fail and would have brought the world financial markets to a standstill if they did. I also understand what happened with those that did fail and what their limitations were at time. It would have a tremendous effect--it is already having a tremendous effect, because right now most small businesses are having a difficult time borrowing money with the same entities that did not fail. But because they are having to go from a leveraged model to a much lower leveraged model than they were practicing--and those are major banks that we all know that are still here today, that may be owned by someone else. I can give a perfect example of a public hospital that I sit on the board of; and we were forced to liquidate our endowment fund to pay off our bonds because we couldn't get the line of credit to secure those bonds that we could always get with no problem. We had the money to do it, but it will put the hospital in a very tenuous situation in the event we continue to lose money because of Medicare cuts. And I happen to live in an area which is a very high Medicare area. So it is already having that effect. I can tell you it has had that effect just on what has occurred to small business. Lines of credit and letters of credit are virtually impossible to get for small business.",Speech,
"Mr. Graves","Mr. Loy?",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","What I would say we do: We invest in companies that often don't exist; we help them start. We have been using a phrase of "too small to fail." These are the companies that, a very small proportion of which are going to grow up to be the next Google, Cisco, Apple, Genentech, FedEx, Starbucks, et cetera. And we are concerned about the opposite problem, which is the situation where we are creating a problem, where it is too hard for those companies to get really big, particularly on the IPO side, so they are choosing to sell out early in order to get some money back to the investors. And typically when other companies are acquired by companies--including, increasingly, overseas companies--they are not going to grow up to be the drivers of 12.1 million jobs that represent the last 20 years of venture investing. In terms of the impact of the Lehman-led crisis or another one--Mr. Harris' example is actually an interesting one; he mentioned that in order to get liquidity for their bond fund, they had to liquidate their endowment--the largest source of capital for our industry is actually endowments and foundations and pension funds; and we have seen a dramatic drop in their willingness or ability to provide capital to our industry because they are repurposing it away from higher risk, higher reward, but highly illiquid and long-term investments to short- term liquidity needs. I would characterize it as much as a timing problem at any moment in time. The capacity and willingness to fund things for 5 or 10 years, while they grow up to be the next generation drivers of job creation, are seriously at risk. Even as it is, adding more burdens onto us is sort of why we are particularly concerned at this critical moment.",Speech,
"Mr. Hirschmann","The right to fail in an orderly fashion has been one of the key strengths of our economy. Obviously, when everything fails at one time, it requires extraordinary steps. But I think one of the things we need to be careful about is not to design our system so that there is an implied backstop by the Federal Government against the two largest mutual fund companies, the two largest hedge funds, the two largest private equity firms, or the two largest of anything. We need to be able to have the information at the regulator level to understand systemic risk, but not set anybody up to be permanently protected against failure. We can make them fail in a more orderly fashion so they don't burn down the neighborhood, but nobody should be insulated against failure.",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","I love your question. I don't know if you saw the Wall Street Journal a couple of days ago where it shows that 52 percent of all loan originations and closings happen by the top three companies, where if you look at that 2 years ago, one of them was down to like 4 percent. That is dangerous. That is why I said in my opening remarks that the small businesses are at risk. Do we want loan origination for home mortgages to be controlled by three companies in America? There have been an awful lot of choices for mortgages--a lot of small mortgage bankers who have done a phenomenal job, who never ever participated in the subprime or pay option ARMs that got us in this mess to begin with. But a lot of these small companies can't get warehouse lines of credit. We did a very good job. My company, personally, we had the second lowest FHA delinquencies in the State of Louisiana, and we are at risk. So is a company too big to fail? I don't think so.",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","Congressman, it is hard to come up with the number as to how large is a company that is too big to fail. I think more important is, how much it is leveraged, how interconnected it is; and in our business, how you manage your accumulations or how much stuff do you have out there that could cause a problem. For example, as far as leveraging goes, our company is a mutual company. The only way we can raise capital is through operations. We do not issue stock. In our business, one of the leverage measures is premium-to-capital or premium-to-surplus, which is a proxy for how many policies you write and how much exposure you have. In our business three-to-one, three times your capital, is probably the upper limit. Two-to-one is much better. My company is one-to-one because we are pretty conservative. I am told some banks get up to 30-to-1. The question really is, what is your leverage ratio? I think that is one point that is more important than absolute size. Another question is how interconnected you are. What is the counterpart of your risk if either the counterpart or yourself has a problem? In our industry rarely reinsure one another. When we buy reinsurance, kind of like laying off a bet, we go to the worldwide market. So there is not much interconnectivity in our industry, but it is something I believe you can measure. And finally, there is what we call "accumulations". That is, how many houses do you insure on the beach and how many businesses on an earthquake fault line and so on. You need to be able to measure precisely that and report that to regulators to make sure that you haven't overextended yourself. I think if you look at those three items instead of absolute size, you could come up with a much better result.",Speech,
"Mr. Graves","Thank you, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mrs. Dahlkemper.",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez and Ranking Member Graves for convening this critical hearing on the impact of financial and regulatory restructuring on small businesses and community lenders. And thank you to the panel of witnesses for joining us today. While it is clear from the recent economic crisis that we must impose greater oversight, transparency and accountability in the financial sector, we must also ensure that our financial regulatory restructuring does not negatively impact the ability of financial institutions to continue to provide the American people, our small businesses and our communities with access to capital. Ensuring liquidity in the market will continue to promote economic recovery. In my district in Pennsylvania, local businesses are reeling as a result of banks not lending. So we have to enact balanced reform, but still allow for a healthy flow of capital. However, we must also ensure that consumers are protected and adequately informed in their financial choices and that they are ensured a variety of financial products that carry better disclosed and understood risk. Mr. Anderson, I do have a couple questions for you. In your testimony, you mentioned a host of Federal regulations that mortgage brokers must comply with. Which Federal agencies are charged with enforcing these regulations?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","Well, we have got RESPA; that is number one, under HUD. We have the Truth in Lending Act. I mean that has to do with your disclosures, your good faith and truth in lending. All of this, mortgage brokers, banks savings and loans, we all operate under that umbrella. Also in our States, individual States, we have to adhere to the same policies; and some of our States have predatory lending laws. In Louisiana, we just passed a law that there are no prepayment penalties, which is a good thing. So we are all under the same umbrella, and we have to comply with our own State lending laws. And we have got the Safe Licensing Act, which is for everybody.",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","Let me ask you, because there are a number of agencies: Do you think it would be better, in your view, to combine enforcement under one agency or entity, rather than having to deal with a number of different agencies?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","I don't know if that is going to create a bottleneck. I am not sure. We feel that we need to slow down, maybe look at this further. We are all for--the National Association of Mortgage Brokers is all for simpler, easier disclosures. I think if we look at what happened in the past with the subprime and all of those other loans, I think we--I relate it to the pharmaceutical industry. If you take Vioxx, what happened to Vioxx? It was banned. We didn't go after the pharmacists or the drugstores on the corner. We went after the manufacturer. And I think if we control the manufacturer, that is, the product--if the product caused the foreclosure crisis, we need to eliminate that product.",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","Let me ask you then a question that goes along with that, because it has been reported that mortgage brokers who processed the subprime loans are now counseling individuals who are indebted by those loans regarding their restructuring. So does your association promote standards by which brokers evaluate the financial suitability of loan products by prospective borrowers? Or do you just rely upon the lenders, underwriters for that?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","Well, the way the National Association of Mortgage Brokers operates, we have a very strong code of ethics. We do not have a fiduciary responsibility to the borrowers. We counsel the borrowers. We do not underwrite the loans. And I will give a prime example where the mortgage broker got blamed, and that was with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And we know what happened there. I can tell you, I have done a lot of loans, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac had an automated underwriting system and they would approve borrowers at 100 percent financing with a 65 percent debt-to-income ratio before taxes. Now, can the mortgage broker turn that borrower down when it was approved by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? If we did take that approach, if I would turn somebody down for that, I could be sued because--for discrimination or what have you. And those are the mistakes that happened.",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","So what is your role then in this?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","The role of a mortgage broker is to offer the products, just like an insurance broker. Why do you go do a insurance broker? Because they represent a whole host of carriers. The mortgage broker does the same thing; we represent a whole host of carriers of lenders and banks across the country. We service a lot of small, rural areas. And the mortgage broker has done a phenomenal job. There is equal blame across the board for banks, mortgage brokers--",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","So you don't have any financial stability standards that you, as an association, apply?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","I mean, we have a strong code of ethics.",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","Thank you. My time is up. I yield back. Chairwoman Velazquez. Would the gentlewoman yield?",Speech,
"Mrs. Dahlkemper","Yes. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Harris, if you provided bad advice to a customer or client, would you be liable?",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","Oh, yes. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Anderson, if you sell a product that is inappropriate, that is not a good product, are you liable?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","That is a hard question. I mean-- Chairwoman Velazquez. My guess is that that is the core of her question when she asked "regulators." There is not such a regulator who would come in and examine and do any regulating examination of your activities?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","No. We are regulated. We are examined; on a State level, we are examined. Chairwoman Velazquez. We are talking about the Federal Government and Federal legislation that is pending before--that is being considered now, that is being worked by Chairman Frank. So the question is consolidating Federal regulation so that it has uniformity with the mortgage brokers industry.",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","Madam Chairwoman, if I could also comment because I answered you with a very simple answer when I said, "Oh, yes." Not only to our client, but if we provide bad tax advice and in the end, as the result of an IRS audit, the IRS can and will fine us significantly. We also face criminal penalties from the IRS. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you, and I want to thank the Chairlady for having this hearing. I--this is my third term in Congress, and I want to congratulate her in having this, because this is the first hearing we have had, I think--at least that I have been associated with in my committees--that really we get to hear the unintended consequences of what a proposed piece of legislation can bring into different entities that are so important to our economy. So I want to thank her for doing that, because unintended consequences are things that happen when we pass legislation hastily up here. Mr. Anderson, I want to say that I know that the mortgage brokers--I come from a real estate background, the building business--that you all were very big proponents of the SAFE Act that was passed in 2008 that basically licensed brokers, mortgage brokers, which had not been the case. So you have been a proponent of regulation that you thought was necessary for your industry. But we see unintended consequences all the time up here. The credit card act that we passed with the consumer protection stuff in there, there has been an unintended consequence that people that actually really need a credit card and actually need some short-term credit are not able to get it. And when we passed some housing legislation--and, Mr. Anderson, I will address this to you--I think it has some unintended consequences. And, sure, we made bad loans and we had all different types--as Mr. Loy said, derivatives. We were selling programs that nobody even knew what they were. They just knew they were making a bunch of money doing it. But right now, if I understand it correctly from some of my friends still in the real estate business and still in the mortgage business, there are some loans in some States that you can't even offer people. Because of some of the regulations that have been put on as far as what credit scores are, additional points and fees that are added to these things, that came from some of the regulation that we passed trying to help the situation, have actually hindered it. Can you comment on that?",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","Yes, we have--if I can use the term, "we have had our hands tied." And there are many, many States out there, and we are one of them, that we enjoyed a very low foreclosure rate. And the restrictions, I will tell you that there is no question--my firm is also part of the largest real estate firm in the Gulf south, and I will tell you that there is no question that the pendulum has swung so far this way now that the credit is tightening, we depleting the pool of eligible borrowers to buy these properties, and we have got to be careful. We have got to, somehow, come back in the middle somewhere. We know the subprime loans were bad, and you are right. People made an awful lot of money from Wall Street on down. There is no question, plenty of blame to go around. But get back to the safe mortgage product, but the credit score restrictions; and I tell you all, of all the loans that have a done in my 31-year career, if anyone can tell me the difference between a 619 and a 620 credit score, I would like to know what that is. Or a 679 and a 680. The difference is nothing on the credit. The difference is, one borrower is going to pay an extra 1.5 to 2 points; and on an investment property--and I see it every day, every day, somebody with an 832 credit score putting 20 percent down can't get a mortgage. That is pretty sad.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","And Mr. Anderson, with the little bit of time that I have left, I know that some of our returning veterans who have been in theater and fought and defended our country, a lot of times our National Guard members and Reserve officers leave great paying jobs to go serve our country. And when they come back, sometimes their credit score has been hurt, or the spouse maybe has done something. I understand that some of these restrictions are making it harder and harder for our military to be able to get it. Because if I understand it correctly from some of the news today, some of these credit scores are being lowered 10, 20, 30, 40, even 50 points, without anyone knowing it, just because of the reduction in the credit market.",Speech,
"Mr. Anderson","You are absolutely right. Guys, I have seen credit scores drop 30, 40 points--and I am not kidding you--for a $12 medical collection that they had no idea that they had. I mean, it is amazing. We are just set on this number of a credit score. There are so many factors that you have to look at. I mean, it seems like we are going back 20 or 30 years which--there is nothing wrong with that concept, but people have to qualify. But just using a number and a credit score, that is creating some problems.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","",Speech,
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Thank you, Madam Chair. You know, it seems as though the approach that the Financial Services Committee is taking is that we have got a problem out here, and/or they think they have got a problem, and we are going to use a big patch on it. And it seems like having a sprained ankle and cut the leg off to solve our problem. I think sometimes when we have a problem, we have to see what the problem is and then go back and fix that problem and not have the unintended consequence, what Congressman Westmoreland was talking about. Too often it appears to me in this situation that this piece of legislation is so broad it is going to provide an umbrella over anything when anybody has any sort of a monetary transaction. I think you gentleman have helped to define where we ought to be going this, and it is the big guys that have stumbled along and not done things the way they should have; and a lot of other folks are being caught in this net. So I guess my comment is, have I identified this correctly? Do you think basically we need to be looking at the too-big-to- fail-guys that really were--the problem seems to originate from? Are there some small players in this that have got enough blame to go around, and we can play with them too? Mr. Robinson? I don't think you guys had any problems. We only had one insurance company, and that was the investment portion of that that was the problem versus the insurance company; is that right?",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","That is correct, Congressman. If there is a common thread that I could recommend that might answer some of these questions, it is, how broad a measure would be needed to cover all kinds of problems. It is answering a simple question like, Who underwrites the risk and who prices it? Because you could have somebody saying, Well, I thought the loan originator was. Well, I thought they were. Well, who is? Whether it is a credit default swap or a mortgage. And I think as we try to solve these issues--and there is no question that there are issues to be solved--that instead of perhaps picking a number to define too-big-to-fail, say, All right, you are big; what are your exposures and how much capital do you have to handle what statisticians would call the tail events--things that you don't think happen? And if they cannot answer those questions clearly and they perhaps have no idea, then that might aim you towards the real root cause of the issue. And that might be a good step, I would recommend.",Speech,
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Okay.",Speech,
"Mr. Hirschmann","I think you are right to identify the scope of the proposed CFPA as one of the problems. There are a couple of other issues, including, it separates out consumer protection from safety and soundness regulation. So you might have one regulator telling you to go left and the other telling you to go right with no way to reconcile the differences. That clearly will impact the availability of credit, particularly for small firms. The other is the ill definition of all the terms. For example, it sets up a new, vaguely defined abuse standard. What our study reveals is that a product that might seem to be abusive for one individual consumer in a particular financial condition might be the lifeline for a small business to meet their payroll that week and perfectly appropriate for the small business. It is hard to imagine how a Federal regulator could anticipate those differences and make sure we don't accidentally cut off the vital lifeline for small businesses.",Speech,
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","My time is going to run out here. Quickly, with Mr. Hirschmann and Mr. Loy and Mr. Harris, quick answers. I know we are going to have some bankers in the next section. I was curious about access to credit. I think that really impacts small businesses in small communities and suburbs of our cities. Have you had any comments or problems with some of the members of Chambers of Commerce with regard to access to credit that you would like to comment on--particular industries, in particular?",Speech,
"Mr. Hirschmann","Access to credit is a significantly enhanced problem in this crisis. What our study finds is that even before the crisis, half of the smallest firms had access- to-credit problems. It is clearly magnified. I don't know whether you point--obviously, you don't want banks to make loans that are being given to inadequate--people that don't have adequate credit. On the other hand, you want to make sure that the small businesses have credit. That is why this secondary credit market, the ability of small firms to rely on their personal credit, especially when they are starting a business, is vital to start-ups and vital to creating new jobs in this country.",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","I would agree, with a caveat. Most of the businesses that we fund are so raw, they are pure garage start-ups, they are not eligible for credit. So we don't use credit, or companies don't, until they have grown into larger entities. And it is at that stage where, historically, we have been able to bring in credit provider to scale the job creation. That now is not happening, so we are having to supply more and more equity to later-stage start-ups, and that is causing us to not have as much ability to invest in the brand-new things. There is a falloff in seed-stage company creation because the capital that we have, that was supposed to be for that, is filling the role that debt used to play for our larger companies. Chairwoman Velazquez. Time has expired.",Speech,
"Ms. Fallin","",Speech,
"Ms. Fallin","Thank you, Madam Chair. I am sorry I couldn't be here for all the hearing, but what I have heard is very interesting; and I will talk about what I am hearing in my home State of Oklahoma. I am hearing from businesses that lines of credit are hard to come by, that they are seeing sometimes double-increased rates on their interest rates. I am hearing that their lines of credit have been, many times, cut in half to where they do not have the lines of credit. And I am hearing from some of our business owners that when they do want to take equity out of their businesses, they can't take it out of their businesses to expand their product. My question would be, what has changed over the last 2 to 3 years that has caused this market to tighten up? And what are the problems associated that have caused those things? And in this new Consumer Financial Protection Act, do you think that will help the situation where more money will be available and the credit will start flowing? Or are we reaching too far, and it is going to cause the market to contract?",Speech,
"Mr. Harris","I will say that it is very hard--I refer to smaller businesses and some are public institutions--hospitals, private schools--who are suffering because they can't get their loans. The problem is--the community banks are wonderful, and they serve a tremendous need for smaller clients, and they have come through for the clients and the small businesses. The community banks have been very good. The problem we see in that area is when you get to $2 and $3 or $4 and $15 or $18 million, which are still small entities in small towns, who have these kinds of lines of credit or letters of credit to secure bonds, public bonds that have been issued. The big banks are the ones who can no longer make those loans, and as a result--we are seeing in a number of private institutions--they are having to try to figure out a way to pay off the bonds with far more expensive capital. And it is not a positive thing; it is not good for them. And what you are hearing at your home is the same as I am hearing all across the country.",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","I was just in Oklahoma last week for 3 days looking at seed-stage start-ups to invest in, coming out of your research universities. Some really exciting things, particularly in the energy arena.",Speech,
"Ms. Fallin","I hope you put the money there.",Speech,
"Mr. Loy","We are looking and we want to, precisely for that reason. We don't provide credit; we provide investment equity capital. But because these start-ups cannot get a home equity loan to finance their start-up, they are needing $500,000 from us; and it is getting harder and harder for us to provide that for the reasons I just said. And the potential for this regulation would be disproportionately felt on the smallest firms that provide that earliest stage of capital. So there is a good chance that entire swath of $500,000 to $1 million of seed-stage capital, if we are forced to follow hedge funds regulation, the cost of that will drive the firms who do that out of business.",Speech,
"Ms. Fallin","Can I ask, also, another question? I am hearing from our local bankers that the fee increases to recapitalize FDIC is causing them not to have as much capital and loans to put out into the marketplace. And they have told me, like in my State, that $37 million has gone out in fee increases which they could be lending out to our small businesses and even to those who are wanting to have mortgages. And they are concerned about another fee increase on those small bankers that will once again drive capital and take it out of the marketplace. Are you seeing that back in your individual organizations and States, that it is taking the capital out of the marketplace, lending ability?",Speech,
"Mr. Hirschmann","It is certainly something we hear from our small banking members. If you go to any local Chamber across the country, you will find a small banker on the board, and it is particularly one-- so whether those fees are necessary, clearly you have to keep FDIC moving. We are going through a very exigent period here. The real question is, do you want to add fees on top of that even further through the Consumer Financial Protection Agency? It is clearly the wrong time to add unnecessary fees, particularly when they won't produce the intended result.",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","Congresswoman, perhaps there is a parallel in the financial services--noninsurance financial service area you that might consider. I mentioned earlier about underwriting, or identifying the risk, underwriting it and pricing it properly. And you do the best job you can, whether it be a house on a beach or a subprime mortgage or whatever. And then, when the hurricane comes or the collapse happens, management meetings happen that say, We are not going to do that again. And then we have to recast our expectations, and that usually results in underwriting tightening up, which could mean change in credit score or unwillingness to put out lines of credit. Also, a bad result could result in an organization being overleveraged. We have too much out there and so we have to pull back.",Speech,
"Ms. Fallin","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Chairwoman Velazquez. With that, let me take this opportunity to thank all of you for participating. You have given very insightful information. The members of the panel are excused. And I will ask the members of the second panel to please come forward and take your seats. Thanks. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our first witness is Mr. James D. MacPhee, the CEO of Kalamazoo County State Bank in Schoolcraft, Michigan, founded in 1908. Mr. MacPhee is testifying on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. ICBA represents 5,000 community banks of all sizes and charter types throughout the United States. Thank you. You will have 5 minutes. STATEMENT OF JAMES D. MacPHEE",Speech,
"Mr. MacPhee","Thank you, Chairman Velazquez and Ranking Member Graves. I am pleased to represent the 5,000 members of the Independent Community Bankers of America at this timely and important hearing. Just over one year ago, due to the failure of some of the Nation's largest firms to manage their high-risk activities, key elements of the Nation's financial system nearly collapsed. Community banks and small businesses, the cornerstone of our local economies, have suffered as a result of the financial crisis and the recession sparked by megabanks and unregulated financial players. In my State of Michigan, we face the Nation's highest unemployment rate of 15.2 percent. Yet community banks like mine stick to commonsense lending and serve our customers and communities in good times and bad. The bank has survived the Depression and many recessions in our more than 100-year history, and it proudly serves the community through the financial crisis today--without TARP money, I might add. The financial crisis, as you know, was not caused by well- capitalized, highly regulated commonsense community banks. Community banks are relationship lenders and do the right thing by their customers. Therefore, financial reform must first do no harm to the reputable actors like community banks and job- creating small businesses. For their size, community banks are enormous small business lenders. While community banks represent about 12 percent of all bank assets, they make 31 percent of the small business loans less than $1 million. Notably half of all small business loans under $100,000 are made by community banks. While many megabanks have pulled in their lending and credit, the Nation's community banks are lending leaders. According to an ICBA analysis of the FDIC's second quarter banking data, community banks with less that $1 billion in assets were the only segment of the industry to show growth in net loans and leases. The financial crisis was driven by the anti-free-market logic of allowing a few large firms to concentrate unprecedented levels of our Nation's financial assets, and they became too big to fail. Unfortunately, a year after the credit crisis was sparked, too-big-to-fail institutions have gotten even bigger. Today, just four megafirms control nearly half of the Nation's financial assets. This is a recipe for a future disaster. Too-big-to-fail remains a cancer on our financial system. We must take measures to end too-big-to-fail by establishing a mechanism to declare an institution in default and appoint a conservator or receiver that can unwind the firm in an orderly manner. The only way to truly protect consumers, small businesses, our financial system, and the economy is to enact a solution to end too-big-to-fail. To further protect taxpayers, financial reform should also place a systemic risk premium on large, complex financial firms that have the potential of posing a systemic risk. All FDIC- insured affiliates of large, complex financial firms should pay a systemic risk premium to the FDIC to compensate for the increased risk they pose. ICBA strongly supports the Bank Accountability and Risk Assessment Act of 2009, introduced by Representative Gutierrez. In addition to a systemic risk premium, the legislation would create a system for setting rates for all FDIC-insured institutions that is more sensitive to risk than the current system and would strengthen the deposit insurance fund. ICBA strongly opposes reform that will result in a single Federal bank regulatory agency. A diverse and competitive financial system with regulatory checks and balances will best serve the needs of small business. Community bankers agree that consumer protection is the cornerstone of or financial system. However, ICBA has significant concerns with the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency. Such a far-reaching expansion of government can do more harm than good by unduly burdening our Nation's community bankers, who did not engage in the deceptive practices targeted by the proposal. It could jeopardize the availability of credit and choice of products, and shrink business activity. In conclusion, to protect and grow our Nation's small businesses and economy, it is essential to get financial reform right. The best financial reforms will protect small businesses from being crushed by the destabilizing effects when a giant financial institution stumbles. Financial reforms that preserve and strengthen the viability of community banks are key to a diverse and robust credit market for small business. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. MacPhee. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Mr. Austin Roberts, the CEO of the Bank of Lancaster, Virginia. The Bank of Lancaster was founded in the northern neck of Virginia in 1930. Mr. Roberts is testifying on behalf of the American Bankers Association. ABA is the trade group and professional association representing the Nation's banking industry.",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, members of the committee, my name is Austin Roberts. I am Vice Chairman, President and CEO of the Bank of Lancaster, which is headquartered in Kilmarnock, Virginia. I am pleased to be here on behalf of the ABA. Small businesses, including banks, are certainly suffering from the severe economic recession. This is the not the first recession faced by banks. Many banks have survived the ups and downs of the economy; mine has survived those for the last 80 years. In fact, most banks have been in their communities for decades and intend to continue to be there for decades. We are not alone, however. In fact, there are more than 2,500 banks, 31 percent of the banking industry, that have been in business for more than a century; 5,000 banks have served their communities for more than half a century. These numbers tell a dramatic story about the staying power of banks and their commitment to the communities they serve. The success of small entrepreneurial businesses are very important to my bank. My bank's focus and those of my fellow bankers throughout the country is on developing and maintaining long-term relationships with these and other customers. In this severe economic environment, it is natural for businesses and individuals to be more cautious. Businesses are reevaluating their credit needs, and as a result, loan demand is also declining. Banks, too, are being prudent in underwriting, and our regulators are demanding it. In fact, in some cases, overly restrictive rules and examinations are hampering the banks' ability to make new loans. While a great deal of attention is rightfully being paid to the administration's regulatory proposal, I would like to share with you other issues that banks like mine are facing. First, the most important threat is the very high premiums being paid by banks to the FDIC. For example, my bank paid $75,000 in premiums in 2008. This year we will pay $550,000 in premiums, with the possibility of it even going to $700,000. There is no question that the industry fully backs the financial health of the FDIC, but such large expenses have a very strong dampening effect on bank lending. ABA has detailed options in a letter to FDIC Chairman Bair that meet the funding needs without creating a financial burden on banks that could reduce bank lending and hurt the economic recovery. Second, ABA is continuing to hear from bankers that regulators are demanding increases in capital and that banks improve the quality of their capital. With capital markets still largely unavailable, especially for community banks, the only course of action in the short run is to reduce lending in order to improve the bank's capital ratio. Third, the recession has strained the ability of some borrowers to perform, which often leads the examiners to insist that a bank make a capital call on their borrower, impose an onerous amortization schedule or obtain additional collateral. These steps can set in motion a death spiral where the borrower has to sell assets at fire sale prices to raise cash, which then increases the write-downs that the banks have to make, and the cycle goes on and on. These actions are completely counter to the notion of working with customers to make sure that credit is available to them or working with borrowers that may even be in distress. There is much more included in my written testimony that details the difficulties that have arisen in the past year, but I want to take a moment to mention one idea that ABA has to increase capital to community banks in areas most hard hit by recession. Banks in these areas are doing everything they can to make credit available, but it is against the significant headwinds of losses from problem loans. The idea, which the ABA shared in a letter to Secretary Geithner 2 days ago, would be to modify Treasury's existing capital assistance program to help well-managed, viable community banks access capital. These banks would match any investment the Treasury makes with private equity. In this way, a relatively small sum of money, say, $5 billion invested by Treasury, matched by $5 billion in private equity, would bring all small banks' capital to levels significantly higher than regulators require to be well capitalized. Having additional capital will provide a cushion for these banks to meet the credit needs of their communities rather than reducing lending to meet regulatory capital requirements. I want to thank you for the opportunity to present these views on challenges ahead for banks that serve small businesses, and I am happy to answer any questions. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Roberts. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Bill Hampel, the Senior Vice President of Research and Policy Analysis for the Credit Union National Association. CUNA provides many services to credit unions, including representation, information, public relations, and business development. Welcome.",Statement,STATEMENT OF AUSTIN ROBERTS
"Mr. Hampel","Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and other members of the committee, thank you very much for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing on behalf of the Credit Union National Association, which represents over 90 percent of our Nation's 8,000 State and Federal credit unions, the State leagues, and their 92 million members. I am Bill Hampel, the Chief Economist. Credit unions did not contribute to the recent financial debacle, and their current regulatory regime, coupled with their cooperative structure, militates against credit unions ever contributing to a financial crisis. As Congress considers regulatory restructuring, it is important that you not throw out the baby with the bathwater. Regulatory restructuring should not just mean more regulation. There needs to be recognition that in certain areas, such as credit unions, regulation and enforcement is sound and regulated entities are performing well. Credit unions have several concerns in the regulatory restructuring debate. These include the preservation of the independent regulator, the development of the CFPA, and the restoration of credit unions' ability to serve their business- owning members. First, it is critical that Congress retain an independent credit union regulator. Because of credit unions' unique mission, governance, and ownership structure, they tend to operate in a low-risk, member-friendly manner. Applying a bank- like regulatory system to this model would threaten the benefits that credit unions provide their members. There is some logic for consolidating bank regulators where competition can lead to lax regulation and supervision, but that condition does not exist for credit unions which have only one Federal regulator, the National Credit Union Administration. The general health of the credit union system proves that our system works well. Considering the CFPA, consumers of financial products, especially those provided by currently unregulated entities, do need greater protection. CUNA agrees that a CFPA could be an effective way to achieve that protection, provided that the agency does not impose redundant or unnecessary regulatory burdens on credit unions. In order for a CFPA to work, consumer protection regulation must be consolidated and streamlined to lower costs and improve consumer understanding. CUNA strongly feels that the CFPA should have full authority to write the rules for consumer protection, but for currently regulated entities, such as credit unions, the examination and enforcement of those regulations should be performed by the prudential regulator that understands their unique nature. Under this approach, the CFPA would have backup examination authority. CUNA urges Congress to take the difficult step of preempting State consumer protection laws if establishing a CFPA. We are confident that by creating a powerful Federal agency with the responsibility to regulate consumer protection law, with rigorous congressional oversight, more than adequate consumer protection will be achieved. And if the CFPA is sufficiently empowered to ensure nationwide consumer protection, why should any additional State rules be necessary? Conversely, if the proposed CFPA is not expected to be up to the task, why even bother establishing such an agency in the first place? Finally, because they are already significantly regulated at the State level, we don't believe that certain types of credit life and credit disability insurance should be under the CFPA. As Congress considers regulatory restructuring legislation, CUNA strongly urges Congress to restore credit unions' ability to properly serve the lending needs of their business-owning members. There is no economic or safety and soundness rationale to cap credit union business lending at 12.25 percent of assets. Before 1998, credit unions faced no statutory limit on their business lending. The only reason this restriction exists is because the banking lobby was able to leverage the provision when credit unions sought legislation to permit them to continue serving their members. The credit union business lending cap is overly restrictive and undermines America's small businesses. It severely limits the ability of credit unions to provide loans to small businesses at a time when these borrowers are finding it increasingly difficult to obtain credit from other types of financial institutions, as was described by Mr. Hirschmann from the U.S. Chamber in the previous panel. It also discourages credit unions that would like to enter the business lending market from doing so. We are under no illusion that credit unions can be the complete solution to the credit crunch that small businesses face, but we are convinced that credit unions should be allowed to play a bigger part in the solution. Eliminating or expanding the business lending cap would allow more credit unions to generate the portfolios needed to comply with NCUA's regulatory requirements and would expand business loans to many credit union members, thus helping local communities and the economy. Credit unions would do this lending prudently; the loss rate on business loans at credit unions is substantially below that of commercial banks. A growing list of small business and public policy groups agree that now is the time to eliminate the statutory credit union business cap for credit unions. And in July, Representatives Kanjorski and Royce introduced H.R. 3380, the Promoting Lending to America's Small Business Act, which would increase the credit union business lending cap to 25 percent of total assets and change the size of a loan to be considered a business loan. We estimate that credit unions could safely and soundly lend an additional $10 billion in small loans in the first year after enactment of such a bill. Madam Chairwoman, thank you very much for convening this hearing, and I look forward to answering the committee's questions. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. We have three votes, so the committee will stand in recess and reconvene after these votes. Chairwoman Velazquez. The committee is called to order. Our next witness is Mr. John Moloney.

"Mr. Moloney","Thank you. Good afternoon, Chairwoman Velazquez, and Ranking Member Graves is not here, but the rest of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify before you on behalf of SIFMA on how changes to the financial regulatory system could affect small broker-dealers. SIFMA and its small member firms applaud your efforts to be the advocate on behalf of small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of the U.S. economy and small broker-dealers are instrumental in serving individual investors and entrepreneurs on Main Street. I will forgo the statistics for the industry and my company. They are in my written testimony. The only thing want to add is--the last line I have here is that my firm, like the overwhelming majority of broker-dealers, was not a TARP recipient. The majority of financial service reform proposals before Congress do not impact smaller firms like mine. However, small firms are concerned that changes contemplated for large global financial service firms could cause disparate effects on small firm operations. Because the investor confidence in these markets is important to all firms, regardless of size, a sound regulatory regime must contain several key elements. It must minimize systemic risk, promote safety and soundness of the regulated entities, promote fair dealing and investigator protection, be consistent from country to country where applicable, and be as effective and efficient as possible. Well crafted and thoughtful legislation is needed to avoid unintended consequences that the firms that I am representing did not cause. Congress should also include sunset provisions under the new laws and regulations so that they may achieve their desired effect and do not promote any undesired consequences. I would like to address two specific features of the financial service reforms that do affect my firm and my brokers. First, SIFMA has long advocated the modernization and harmonization of disparate regulatory regimes for brokers, dealers, investment advisors and other financial intermediaries. We welcome Treasury's proposed legislation, which appears to acknowledge these important distinctions and which would give the SEC the authority to establish rules for a new uniform Federal fiduciary standard that supersedes and improves on existing standards and is applied only in the context of providing personalized investment advice to individual investors. Second, predispute arbitration clauses are vital to the securities arbitration system. Small investors benefit in particular, as arbitration allows them to pursue claims they could not afford to litigate and do it on a much more timely basis. Treasury has proposed giving the SEC the authority to prohibit predispute arbitration clauses in broker-dealer and investment advisory account agreements with retail clients if it studies these clauses and concludes that there is any harm on investors. SIFMA supports that provision. There are several issues that impact regulation of smaller firms that I would like to address. While each one may be insignificant, taken as a whole the cumulative effect can be quite devastating. For example, fees for financial audits of small firms will increase due to the SEC's decision not to extend an exemption from small firms' Sarbanes-Oxley audit requirements. FINRA has proposed to eliminate anti-money- laundering third-party exemption for small firms; this will increase AML audit costs. SIPC, FINRA, and the MSRB have proposed or implemented increased assessments to firms already. The cumulative impact of these and other changes drain limited resources from small firms and from their efforts in paying for the compliance training and customer service functions. Finally, SIFMA supports the small business community initiative to correct deficiencies in Reg X to eliminate outdated regulations, ensure agencies do not ignore the requirements of Reg X, and compel agencies to consider economic impacts on the rules of small business. Thank you, Madam Chairwoman and the rest of the committee for allowing me to present SIFMA's views. We hope to continue the dialogue on the financial service regulatory reform and stand ready to assist any way we can. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Moloney. Chairwoman Velazquez. Our next witness is Ms. Dawn Donovan, the CEO of Price Chopper Employees Federal Credit Union in Schenectady, New York. Price Chopper has over 6,500 members with assets of $16 million. Ms. Donovan is testifying on behalf of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. The Association of Federal Credit Unions was founded in 1967 to shape the laws under which Federal credit unions operate. Welcome.",Statement,STATEMENT OF E. JOHN MOLONEY
"Ms. Donovan","Good afternoon, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and members of committee. My name is Dawn Donovan, and I am testifying today on behalf of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions, NAFCU. I serve as the President and CEO of Price Chopper Employees Federal Credit Union in Schenectady, New York. Our credit union has seven employees, approximately 4,500 members in six States and just over $19 million in assets. NAFCU and the entire credit union community appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion regarding financial regulatory restructuring and its impact on America's credit unions. It is widely recognized that credit unions did not cause the current economic downturn; however, we believe we can be a important part of the solution. Credit unions have fared well in the current economic environment and as a result many have capital available. Surveys of NAFCU member credit unions have shown that many are seeing increased demand for mortgage and auto loans as other lenders leave the market. Additionally, a number of small businesses who have lost important lines of credit from other lenders are turning to credit unions for the capital that they need. Our Nation's credit unions stand ready to help in this time of crisis and unlike other institutions have the assets to do so. Unfortunately, an antiquated and arbitrary member business cap prevents credit unions from doing more for America's small business community. It is with this in mind that NAFCU strongly supports H.R. 3380, the Promoting Lending to America's Small Businesses Act of 2009. This important piece of legislation would raise the member-business lending cap to 25 percent of assets, while also allowing credit unions to supply much-needed capital to underserved areas which have been among the hardest hit during the current economic downturn. NAFCU also strongly supports the reintroduction of the Credit Union Small Business Lending Act, which was first introduced by Chairwoman Velazquez in the 110th Congress. As the current Congress and administration mull regulatory reform, NAFCU believes that the current regulatory structure for credit unions has served the 92 million American credit union members well. As not-for-profit member-owned cooperatives, credit unions are unique institutions in the financial services arena and make up only a small piece of the financial services pie. We believe that NCUA should remain the independent regulator of credit unions and are pleased to see the administration's proposal would maintain this independence as well as the Federal credit union charter. NAFCU also believes that the proposal is well intentioned in its effort to protect consumers from the predatory practices that led to the current crisis. We feel there have been many unregulated bad actors pushing predatory products onto consumers, and we applaud efforts to address this abuse. It is with this in mind that we can support the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, CFPA, which would have authority over nonregulated institutions that operate in the financial services marketplace. However, NAFCU does not believe such an agency should be given authority over regulated federally insured depository institutions, and opposes extending this authority to credit unions. As the only not-for-profit institutions that would be subject to the CFPA, credit unions would stand to get lost in the enormity of the proposed agency. Giving the CFPA the authority to regulate, examine, and supervise credit unions, already regulated by the NCUA, would add an additional regulatory burden and cost to credit unions. Additionally, it could lead to situations where institutions regulated by one agency for safety and soundness find their guidance in conflict with the regulator for consumer issues. Such a conflict will result in diminished services to credit union members. Credit unions already fund the budget for NCUA. As not-for- profits, credit unions cannot raise moneys from stock sales or capital markets. This money comes from their members' deposits, meaning credit union members would disproportionately feel the cost burden of a new agency. However, NAFCU also recognizes that more should be done to help consumers and look out for their interests. We would propose that rather than extending the CFPA to federally insured depository institutions, each functional regulator create a new strengthened office on consumer protection. We were pleased to see the NCUA recently announce its intention to create such an office. Consumer protection offices at the functional regulators will ensure those regulating consumer issues have knowledge of the institutions they are examining and guidance on consumer protection. This is particularly important to credit unions as they are regulated and structured differently from others. We believe such an approach would strengthen consumer protection while not adding unnecessary regulatory burden. Part of avoiding that burden will be to maintain a level of Federal preemption so small institutions like mine, with members in several States, are not overburdened by a wide variety of State laws. In conclusion, while there are positive aspects to consumer protection and regulatory reform, we believe Federal credit unions continue to warrant an independent regulator handling safety and soundness and consumer protection matters. I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you on behalf of NAFCU and would welcome any questions that you may have. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Ms. Donovan. Chairwoman Velazquez. I am going to ask this question to everyone. I will ask everyone to answer, even though I anticipate the answers that you will provide--but just to be on the record. As you know, the President laid out five core elements for reform in his white paper, and these include stronger supervision of institutions, comprehensive supervision of financial markets, enhanced consumer protection, the creation of tools for financial crisis, and increasing international cooperation. In your opinion, which of these elements should be prioritized? Mr. MacPhee?",Statement,STATEMENT OF DAWN DONOVAN
"Mr. MacPhee","I think given what we have just come through in this country, and the lack of regulation on the unregulated--and oversight--and the dismal position that we found ourselves in when the smoke cleared in terms of the funding of our reserve for FDIC insurance, et cetera, I think oversight has to be the first priority. And I think the systemic risk in our whole system has to be priority. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Roberts.",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","Madam Chair, I would think also that the issues surrounding systemic risk and surrounding those organizations that previously were unregulated or underregulated are the most important items to address among those items that you talked about. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Hampel","",Speech,
"Mr. Hampel","I would agree with those comments. One thing the Congress needs to be concerned about is, right now there is a fervor to do regulatory reform because we are still in the latter stages of the crisis. And that is perhaps not the best time to make significant changes when we are so caught up in the moment. The risk is, if we wait too long, by the time we have had enough time to study it properly, there will not be sufficient impetus do it--extending some form of regulation to the currently unregulated. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Moloney.",Speech,
"Mr. Moloney","Again, I think the systemic element has to be dealt with as a high-priority item. I would also maybe go to the other end and start with the consumer protection and move up from there. Between those two, I think you can cover a lot of ground towards making it a more effective and fair playing field. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay.",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","Madam Chair, I would say our position would be the systemic risk. But also the regulation of the unregulated, pretty much as Mr. Hampel and the other members of this panel have said. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. Roberts and Ms. Donovan, during times of financial duress, higher capital requirements can provide a cushion for lenders. But these increased levels can also restrict a bank or credit union's ability to make loans to small firms. Can you talk about how higher capital requirements might impact your small business lending practices?",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","I think that is really a very good question. In my testimony, I spoke about the fact that in 2008, my bank paid $75,000 in FDIC insurance. In 2009, that number could be anywhere between $550,000 and $700,000. When you start looking at those numbers, what in turn you see is, that means profitability. Money that is going to go into the capital of our organization is going to be reduced by $475,000 to about $600,000. In turn, what that relates to is capital to support loans, loans that might be available, supported by that capital, could be anywhere from $5 million to $7 million less. That is certainly going to impact our ability to lend to small businesses as well as customers as a whole. As those capital requirements get to be tighter, it certainly does provide an additional safety net, but one has to keep in mind that it is also going to restrict lending. Chairwoman Velazquez. And then there will be other people that will say that the risk to taxpayers and depositors goes down.",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","I would--my response to you is, I think there is a practical level of capital that can satisfy both sides of that particular equation. We talked earlier--I think at the prior panel--that some people were leveraged 30-to-1; that is probably too much. Is 5- to-1 too little? I would suggest that it is. I think there is a capital level that is a reasonable balance that continues funds able to be lent and still provides that safety to the taxpayer. Chairwoman Velazquez. Ms. Donovan?",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","Madam Chair, most credit unions today have sufficient capital. We have good capital on hand. Unfortunately, the artificial cap that is on member lending is what is refraining us from lending that out. I am a very small credit union, as I noted. We have hardly any member-business lending, very little. However, we do have the capital to lend to the small businesses in our community. And most credit unions do have that at this point. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. Mr. Moloney, up until the financial crisis, the economy experienced a decade of relatively solid growth, and during this time we saw an explosion of financial innovation and all of the products that went with it. Are you concerned that the proposed regulation might reverse this trend of financial innovation?",Speech,
"Mr. Moloney","Good question. "Yes" is the short answer, but I probably would like to also state that I think that it is very possible that with the creation of these innovative products, we may have gotten ahead of ourselves and had things that people really did not fully think out and sold to clients who didn't have a clue. So maybe the answer is "yes." I want to have that ability, but I also want to make sure that the people who are involved on the buying and the selling side of it know the products that they are dealing with. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. MacPhee and Mr. Hampel, addressing systemic risk will be an essential element of the reform proposal. As you noted in your testimony, community banks are smaller and are much less interconnected than larger international institutions. Even so, community banks can still transmit risk into the financial system. In light of this, should community banks or all credit unions be subject to systemic regulation?",Speech,
"Mr. Hampel","Well, Madam Chair, speaking for credit unions, my understanding of systemic risk is such that if even the largest 10 credit unions were all to get into extreme difficulty at same time, it would not spread to the rest of the financial system. So I don't think that credit unions could ever be the source of systemic risk, just by the nature of their size. However, credit unions, because they are connected and users of the rest of the financial system, can be victims of the systemic risk of other institutions; and that is why we are interested in the issue. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. I have other questions, but I will--",Speech,
"Mr. Graves","I will pass, Madam Chair, for now. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Westmoreland?",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you, Madam Chair. Let me say--you know, the first panel we talked about unintended consequences. And, Mr. Roberts, you hit the nail on the head with your testimony about being the victims of somebody else doing some wrong things in the banking industry. You understand that our concern about some of these new agencies that are created, we don't know what the rules and regs are going to be. And that is basically what has happened with some of the legislation that we have passed recently not knowing how the regulators are going to go out into these banks and enforce certain regulations that Congress really does not have any control over. Now, I know from talking to some of my independent bankers and community bankers that--how many sets of regulators, Mr. Roberts, does the typical bank have in Virginia? Are you in Michigan or Virginia?",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","I am in Virginia.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Virginia?",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","We are--again, with a dual banking system, we are a State-chartered bank that happens also to be a member of the Federal Reserve System. We are regulated by the Commonwealth of Virginia and we are also regulated by the Federal Reserve.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","How many sets of regulators do you have come in?",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","We will have, in any particular year, at least two examinations. One would be a safety and soundness examination by either the State or the Federal Reserve. The second would be a consumer affairs examination that is solely looking at our adherence to consumer protection laws; that is done by the Federal Reserve. I think it was stated earlier in this testimony that I fully believe that the prudential regulator, the one who has responsibility for safety and soundness, ought to have responsibility for consumer affairs. I would also share with the committee, about 6 weeks ago we just completed a consumer affairs examination by the Federal Reserve. Prior to that examination, we received a questionnaire from the Federal Reserve, probably 45-50 pages long, requesting a number of documents, as well as questions. We had 14 examiners come into our bank for 2 weeks to review all of those issues that they thought might have arisen through that pre- questionnaire. I would suggest to you that it was a very extensive, fully complete examination that is entirely separate from safety and soundness.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","On top of that we had another knee-jerk- reaction kind of thing in Congress actually before I got here, Sarbanes-Oxley. Could you tell me, due to that knee-jerk reaction, how much that costs the average bank? I know you said your FDIC premiums went from 75 to 5 and something. What kind of cost and what kind of audit does the Sarbanes- Oxley law bring to the banking business?",Speech,
"Mr. Robinson","We have done regular reviews of the cost of Sarbanes-Oxley at our bank. The cost, year in and year out, approaches $250,000 to $275,000. We have right at 2.5 million shares of stock outstanding. I have shared with my shareholders at annual meetings the cost is about 10 cents a share. If you are at a trading volume of 10 times earnings, that is going to be a dollar a share. At 16 times earnings that is a $1.60 a share that takes place year in and year out. And I would suggest that my shareholders hardly see the benefit of that reaction.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you. Mr. Moloney, when we talk about things being underregulated, we had the credit default swaps which, if I understand correctly, is a company that was offering insurance on something that they were selling that was not regulated to offer insurance, so they came up with a product called a credit default swap. Is that basically what that is in a common language?",Speech,
"Mr. Moloney","It is an element that our firm was never involved with.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","There is somewhere down the line with the credit default swap and all of these derivatives and stuff that, to me, somebody that was--these companies are regulated. The SEC or somebody should have caught this, and I don't know if it was underregulation or the lack of enforcement in people wanting to expose some of these programs that were out there. But the problem that we are having--and I am in Georgia, and we have had more failed banks that anywhere else, and what is happening is--Mr. Roberts, you spoke of this--the regulators are coming in and changing the way some of these banks, that had a good business going on, are able to lend money, how much cash reserves they have got to have versus how much money they are able to lend; reduction in real estate portfolios that are performing assets, but they are wanting them reappraised, more cash put in the deal. And it is really a snowball effect. And Madam Chair, I will yield. I know I have taken more time than the light. But--I would like to have at least one more round of questioning, if that is possible, but I yield back to you. Chairwoman Velazquez. You can continue.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you, ma'am. From what I see, the problem is that--Mr. MacPhee, being a community bank, I would like to hear from you too. Because what it seems like, when we passed the TARP legislation, we were told that this was going to be used to free up the credit market. And it has had, to me, just the opposite effect on freeing up the credit market. It has already created a snowball effect of real estate values. What is going on in the marketplace; the banks that did get the TARP money are using this just to straighten up their books. And if you look at Goldman Sachs, and Bank of America talked about they made billions of dollars, they were able to buy these assets for 10 to 20 cents on the dollar and then sell them for 30 or 40 cents on the dollar, so they really did have a value there. But to clean up their books and to do what some of these regulators were making them do, people were losing their retirement, they were losing their equity, they were losing all the cash that they had put in the deal, now that they can no longer get out. It has had just the reverse effect on that. And that is what concerns me about some of this big legislation that we are talking about is, some of these unintended consequences of possible rules and regs that can be written and enforced by some agencies that we really have no control over. Could you comment on some of that?",Speech,
"Mr. MacPhee","Yes, thank you. I am no expert on TARP. I do know that at the time that TARP was put into place and the institutions that were qualified for and took TARP, it was an important step in reassuring the public that the financial institution system in this country was going to go on. So I don't fault them for that. I think that being from a community bank, we are a $77 million bank and have 13.7 percent to capital and 29 percent liquidity. It is not a model that you see very often today. When the others were paying out 75 percent in dividends and retaining 25 percent, our model was the opposite. We were paying out 25 percent and retaining 75 percent. I am not saying that we are right and they are wrong. But there was a happy medium in there. I think both the unregulated and the systemically risky, which I would define as those banks over $100 billion could wreak havoc on society again, and did need TARP money to survive. The community banks today, I can tell you, are willing and ready to loan. I have money. Unfortunately for me, I live in a State where the unemployment is so high that I am not seeing the loan value that you might see in other areas.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","I will have you open up a branch in Georgia. We have borrowers down there. One thing for the credit union, you don't belong to the FDIC, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","Correct. We are regulated by the NCUA.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","What kind of fees do you pay them for your deposits?",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","On average to NCUA, it might be a $1,000 or $1,500, what it might cost me. It does not seem like a lot of money, I am sure. However, I have seven employees including myself--six, full-time; one, part-time--and we take care of all 4,500 members over the six States. In the whole scheme of things, it is a lot of money for us. My payroll is very slim. I take on many roles.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","But do you have to pay a premium for what your deposits are, what they guarantee? They guarantee your deposits, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","Correct.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","So your fee for your deposits would be 1,500 bucks?",Speech,
"Ms. Donovan","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Hampel","This year, credit unions will pay an insurance premium of 15 basis points of their insured shares, which is higher than what it normally is for credit unions, but it is because of losses, collateral damage credit unions have experienced. We typically fund our system by credit unions makeing deposits into the fund, and it is the earnings from those deposits that the insurance fund uses to operate. Probably, for the next several years, credit unions will be paying premiums of about 15 basis points. It is probably less than what FDIC- insured institutions will pay, but it is significant compared to what credit unions have historically paid.",Speech,
"Mr. Westmoreland","Thank you. I yield back, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. MacPhee, I would like to ask my last question to you. It is regarding securitization that has been billed as one of the chief culprits in the financial crisis. At the same time it has been credited with increasing the availability of capital for small firms. To what degree does your bank take advantage of loan securitization, and do you believe it should be constrained going forward?",Speech,
"Mr. MacPhee","Our bank has basically used Fannie and Freddie secondary market for liquidity purposes and for helping out with our capital situation. We tend to retain most of our loans in our bank. We still do a 5-year balloon mortgage for our customers, and I think-- one of the things that we have to do as a community bank is, relationship banking rather than transactional banking. So the structure out there for most community bankers that I deal with, it is important to have securitization and collateralization and selling off to the secondary market to keep liquidity in the system. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Roberts.",Speech,
"Mr. Roberts","I would agree with you wholeheartedly that securitization has been a part of the problem that has been created in our economy. And I would agree with you wholeheartedly that securitization is one of those avenues that has allowed greater lending to take place. It has provided additional liquidity, additional funding to come into financial institutions that have allowed for continuing loans to take place. It would seem to me, however, that it has been a part of what has caused some systemic risk; and I think that we need to consider what regulations that we can put into place that would not allow the issues that have happened over the past 12 months to happen again. But that does not mean throwing the baby out with the bathwater and stopping securitization. That has been a very important factor in the ability of this country to go forward. Chairwoman Velazquez. Very good. Does any other member wish to ask questions? Let me take this opportunity thank all of you. This has been very insightful, and as a member of the Financial Services Committee, it helps me to bring a different perspective into the debate. And so, for that, I really appreciate all your cooperation and being here today. Thank you. I ask unanimous consent that members will have 5 days to submit a statement and supporting materials for the record. Without objection, so ordered. This hearing is now adjourned.",Speech,
