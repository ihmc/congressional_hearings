"Mr. Rush","The Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade and Consumer Protection will come to order. Today's hearing is a hearing that we are anxiously awaiting to conduct. It is a hearing on Consumer Credit and Debt, the Role of the Federal Trade Commission in Protecting the Public. The chair would yield himself 5 minutes for the purposes of a opening statement. Three weeks ago, the Subcommittee on Commerce, Trade, and Consumer Protection held a hearing on abusive credit practices in the used-car industry. Today, I want to expand our inquiry into the world of consumer credit and debt in general. For the past decade, if not longer, American consumers, particularly low-income Americans, have been swimming in shark-infested waters. Whether it is sub-prime mortgages, auto loans, or pay-day loans, too many companies have had a free reign to saddle Americans with debts they simply cannot afford. They sold their snake oil by taking advantage of the people's circumstances, or with outright deception. Unfortunately, there wasn't a strong enforcement or regulatory authority at the federal level protecting consumers from these abusive practices. The result has been a wrecked economy, and, I might add, wrecked lives. The purpose of today's hearing is twofold. First, I want us to examine the actions taken by the Federal Trade Commission in cracking down on abusive credit practices. The FTC has broad authority under the FTC Act to enforce against ``unfair or deceptive acts of practices.'' How was this broad authority exercised is one question that we may ask. If the Commission took insufficient action in the past, then why was that the case is another looming question. Was it political will or was it because the Commission lacks sufficient statutory authority and resources is the third question that we should explore. Second, in this hearing, I want members of the subcommittee to deliberate on reforms that Congress can initiate to make the FTC as effective as possible in protecting consumers from abusive credit and debt practices in the marketplace. I am working on legislation that will better equip the Commission to aggressively address abusive lending practices. How can we utilize the Commission's historical authority to prohibit and enforce against unfair or deceptive acts or practices to our advantage? The FTC is America's foremost consumer protection agency, and we need to take advantage of its historical authority by enhancing the Commission's underlying regulatory and enforcement powers. I believe the basic cornerstones of the Consumer Credit Protection Agency are already in place but some reforms are more than likely necessary. Does the Commission need more resources? Should the Commission be given regulatory or rulemaking authority under the Administrative Procedures Act to replace its current, burdensome rulemaking process under Magnusson-Moss? Should the Commission be given additional civil penalty authority? If the FTC has one hand tied behind its back, I believe that we should untie that one hand, but if we do so, we must be assured that the Commission will aggressively utilize these tools to protect consumers to the fullest extent. Today, I want to explore how the FTC can be equipped to adequately deal with not only today's abusive practices, such as sub-prime mortgages and pay-day loans, but also tomorrow's unforeseen snake oil that will be sold to consumers in the future. I want to congratulate and welcome the new chairman of the FTC, Mr. Jon Leibowitz. I have had the opportunity to meet with him, and I find him an outstanding and fine gentleman and a dedicated public servant. And this is his first appearance on Capitol Hill as chairman of the FTC. And I hope that this hearing today will be first in a series of constructive hearings. As chairman of this subcommittee, I want to have a constructive relationship with Chairman Leibowitz and with our friends at the Commission to ensure that both Congress and the FTC are doing everything we can to protect the American consumers, particularly poor American consumers, from the unfair, deceptive, and abusive practices that are far too prevalent in the American economy. With that, I yield back the balance of my time.  "

"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GEORGE RADANOVICH, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA"," "
"Mr. Radanovich","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you so much for holding today's hearing on the FTC's role in financial consumer protection. Given the current economic downturn and the slow thawing freeze in the credit markets, this discussion is particularly timely. Abuses must have the disinfectant of sunlight shone brightly on them, and it is our responsibility as representatives of our constituents to examine the protections afforded to consumers by the law. Any credit scam that takes advantage of innocent consumers is deplorable and we must have our regulators pursue all those responsible for this kind of despicable crime behavior with vigor. My district is located in California San Joaquin Valley, which is suffering from one of the Nation's highest foreclosure rates due to the easy availability of credit, unfortunately, so the easy money was available to consumers because of deception and fraud. These were cases of mortgage fraud, appraisal fraud, and income fraud that all played a part in creating the current mess that we are in. It is reprehensible that people who may have been taken advantage of when they bought their house could now be victims in their time of need. Today, we focus on the Federal Trade Commission's efforts. The FTC deals with matters that affect the economic life of all our constituents. The Commission's consumer protection mission is to ensure consumers are protected from unfair and deceptive practices in or affecting commerce. That Herculean task puts the Commission in the position of overlooking a multitude of industries, and the Commission's responsibility to protect consumers of financial service products are a critical part of this work. The Commission helps to protect consumers at every stage of the consumer credit market from the advertising and the marketing of financial products to debt collection and debt relief. However, the Commission's legal authority does not extend to all entities that provide financial services to consumers. The FTC Act and the statutes the Commission enforces specifically exempt banks, thrifts, and federal credit unions. The FTC, however, had jurisdiction over non-bank financial companies including non-bank mortgage companies, mortgage brokers, and finance companies. As the lead consumer protection agency, it has the expertise and the experience that was recognized by our colleagues on the House Financial Services Committee last Congress. They developed legislation to improve the existing framework of the consumer protection regulations to better coordinate banking regulators rulemakings with those of the Commission, and while avoiding duplicative efforts in the government this coordinated approach to protect consumers of financial services is essential. The same rule should apply regardless of what entity sells the product. I am anxious to hear about the FTC's recent activity in this area, the cooperative efforts among agencies, and whether these efforts are effective. I do have concerns about some of the reforms that have been discussed over the years that would change how the Commission operates. As I mentioned, the FTC's jurisdiction is enormous. Except for the few exempted entities, the Commission's authority to promulgate regulations impacts nearly our entire economic spectrum. Unlike some other agencies who promulgate rules using the procedures of the Administrative Procedures Act, the FTC's rulemaking process is laid out in the Magnusson- Moss FTC Improvement Act. Congress established the Magnusson- Moss rulemaking procedures in the 1970's specifically to be more rigorous than the APA process, in part, to provide affected industries the opportunity to present arguments in an evidentiary hearing. The FTC must base any rule on that hearing record and substantial evidence must be presented to justify it. I am concerned that any significant change to this process would not allow for such careful consideration before rules are finalized. Congress set up the Magnusson-Moss process to be intentionally deliberative, but Congress also has been highly effective in enacting consumer protection legislation on specific issues and providing the Commission with APA rulemaking authority in those cases where it is warranted, such as the Do Not Call Act. I want to thank all our witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to their insight and expertise on how consumers can be best protected. I am particularly interested in hearing if there are any holes in the current law which prevent the FTC from pursuing bad actors and whether or not additional regulations would be effective in deterring unscrupulous lenders and others. If the testimony and the evidence we receive lead to the conclusion that the Commission should be doing more, including regulating entities that it currently does not, I stand ready to work with you, Mr. Chairman, to develop the appropriate legislation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. Now it is my privilege to recognize the chairman of the full committee for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statements, the gentleman from California, Chairman Waxman. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. HENRY A. WAXMAN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA"," "
"Mr. Waxman","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to commend you for holding this hearing, and the fact that your subcommittee is taking a close look at consumer protection in the area of credit and debt. This committee has an important role in ensuring that consumers are protected from unfair, abusive, and deceptive practices throughout the marketplace, including the credit market, and I am pleased to join you in welcoming the chairman, the new chairman, of the Federal Trade Commission, Jon Leibowitz. Congratulations on your appointment. I look forward to working with you on this and other issues before our committee. The current financial crisis has brought to light a host of schemes that have hurt both individual consumers and the economy as a whole, mortgages have required no money down and no proof of income or assets, pay-day lenders who charge 500 percent interest for a short-term loan, companies that take money from individuals based on false offers or they offer to fix a credit report or save a home from foreclosure. These are schemes, and they are allowed to happen because of a fierce anti-regulatory ideology that was prevailing at least in the last 8 years. The philosophy was the government was the source of the problem, that it posed obstacles to success and that it should be slashed wherever feasible. This was the ideology that led to FEMA's failure during Hurricane Katrina, billons of dollars of contracting abuse at the Defense Department, and a food safety system that could not keep unsafe peanuts and spinach off the grocery shelves. The agencies of government responsible for protecting our financial system and Americans' hard-earned assets also suffered under this ideology. There was a feeling that government should step aside and markets should be allowed to work with little or no regulatory intervention. Now we have an opportunity to move beyond the flawed system of the previous 8 years and strengthen consumer protections across the financial system. Today's hearing focuses on the Federal Trade Commission which plays an essential role in overseeing consumer credit. An aggressive and rejuvenated FTC could prevent unfair and deceptive practices before they become commonplace, and it could use its enforcement authority to deter fraudulent schemes. I look forward to working with you, Mr. Chairman, and the members of this committee to making sure that the FTC has the authority, the resources, and the will to be an aggressive consumer protection agency. I yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the chairman, and now recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement, Mr. Pitts from Pennsylvania. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOSEPH R. PITTS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE COMMONWEALTH OF PENNSYLVANIA"," "
"Mr. Pitts","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this important hearing on the role of the Federal Trade Commission and protecting consumers of credit and debt. I think we all agree that we need to ensure that strong consumer protection measures are in place. The recent housing and the credit crises our country has faced has made that abundantly clear. We must do this prudently though, avoiding duplicity and jeopardizing processes that work well, and this is why we should examine legislation already in place to see if it has been successful in protecting consumers. While there may be room for improvements in our consumer protection laws, we should also consider that a complete overhauling of legislation may actually force negative and overly burdensome requirements on those who are being truthful and honest. Again, we all desire effective and efficient enforcement of consumer protection laws, and it is my hope that this committee moves forward in a wise, careful, and deliberative manner, and I look forward to hearing our distinguished witnesses today. Thank you, and yield back."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. And the chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California, my friend, Ms. Matsui, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. DORIS O. MATSUI, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA"," "
"Ms. Matsui","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for calling today's hearing. I applaud your leadership on this issue. I would also like to thank Chairman Leibowitz for being here today with us and congratulate him also. In today's economic recession, many families in my home district of Sacramento are really struggling to make ends meet. I have heard countless stories about people struggling to keep their homes, their jobs, and their way of life. As we all know, the housing crisis has had an unprecedented effect on our economy. The rising unemployment will cause even more Americans to face foreclosure. California, and in particular my home district of Sacramento, has been greatly impacted by the foreclosure crisis. Many of my constituents were victims of predatory lending and were steered into high cost, bad loans. Now many of these homeowners are seeking assistance in modifying their loans to more affordable loan terms. However, that has been a serious issue for many. In some cases, their original loan company is not a business or in some cases their lenders or services are not being responsive leaving struggling homeowners feeling desperate to save their homes. As a result, many have been tricked into contacting scam artists posing as so-called foreclosure consultants or the so- called agencies to save their homes. These scams are costing thousands of dollars and false promises to struggling homeowners. I am a member of the Sacramento District Attorney's Foreclosure Task Force, which is charged with cracking down on mortgage fraud. Many of these unfortunate scams have been well documented in my district. It is clear that consumers are not being properly protected from these shameful, unacceptable practices. We are here today to determine what more the government can and should do to stop these abuses from occurring today and in the future. I think you once again, Mr. Chairman, for holding this important hearing today, and I yield back the balance of my time.  "

"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentlelady. The chair now recognizes the ranking member of the full committee, my friend from Texas, Mr. Barton, for 5 minutes for the purposes of opening statements."
"Mr. Barton","Thank you. And I haven't forgotten about that cowboy hat, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Rush","I thank you very much."

"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JOE BARTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS"," "
"Mr. Barton","Thank you for this hearing today, Mr. Chairman. Its title, Consumer Credit and Debt: The Role of the Federal Trade Commission in Protecting the Public, is an important one. As you know, the subcommittee in the past has explored a multitude of consumer protection issues. We have looked into data security, spyware, spam, and children's on line privacy. We have inquired about how Social Security numbers are abused. We have investigated calling cards and also telemarketing. These areas are important and it is fitting that today we are considering consumer protection particularly given our current economic environment. The fraud in consumer credit is considerable, its ramifications beyond those suffered by the victims. The fall out often damages the businesses with whom the consumer interacts and it nearly always harms consumers at large. Losses reach into the millions of dollars every year and the cost is borne by all of us. We know that the FTC is a strong advocate for consumers policing that activity of those fraudsters who seek to take advantage of consumers in a most repugnant way. I am interested today to learn what the chairman, Mr. Leibowitz, has to say about the tools that his agency has in its toolbox, how it complements the actions of sister agencies with similar authority and the state attorneys general and what additional tools, if any, the Commission needs. Let me add a cautionary note, however. I support efforts to strengthen the Commission's authority where necessary. I am aware too that several stakeholders believe the Commission's authority must be strengthened by eliminating the rulemaking requirements of the Magnusson-Moss Act in 1975 in favor of the Administrative Procedures Act. As we move forward in this debate, I would ask yourself, Mr. Chairman, and the members of this subcommittee, to remember the reasons that Congress imposed the Magnusson-Moss requirements in the first place. The FTC oversees an enormous jurisdiction. Its rules reach into enumerable industries and affect every commercial main street in the country. Given the breadth of that impact, Congress believes that the Commission should take more than 180 days so that it could carefully consider its broad sweeping rulemakings and the comments generated by that consideration. We still have the power here to permit the FTC to side step the Magnusson- Moss Act when necessary and permit rulemaking under APA where it is appropriate and necessary. This is an ability this committee has never had a problem utilizing when we found a situation that warrants it. Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding the hearing. I want to thank our witnesses, and I look forward to reviewing their testimony."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the ranking member. Now the chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement of Mr. Barrow."
"Mr. Barrow","I thank the chair. I will waive an opening."
"Mr. Rush","The gentleman desires 2 minutes in addition to the 5 minutes that he is granted for questioning. So granted. The chair now recognizes my friend and vice-chair of the subcommittee, the gentle woman from Illinois, Ms. Schakowsky, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. JANICE D. SCHAKOWSKY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF ILLINOIS"," "
"Ms. Schakowsky","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing. And congratulations to you, Mr. Leibowitz. We are glad to have you here. The repercussions of years of irresponsible mortgage lending continued to unfold. According to the Center for Responsible Lending, there have been nearly 550,000 new foreclosure filings since 2009 began, 6,600 each day or 1 every 13 seconds. We were trying to calculate how many since this hearing began. It is more than 100, in every 13 seconds yet another. In my State of Illinois more than 100,000 families are projected to lose their homes to foreclosure this year, and this Administration and this Congress are obviously taking steps to mitigate this crisis and ensure it never happens again. But to do that, I really think we have to ask how did we get here. We are here not just because the banks were a problem, and it is not just bank lending that is responsible for billions of dollars worth of bad loans that now must be dealt with in order to put our economy back on track. Lending by non-bank entities has exploded in recent years and a major factor in today's financial crisis Country Wide and other non- bank mortgage lenders are responsible for 40 percent of the home loans made in 2007 and 55 percent of the sub prime loans. It was the Federal Trade Commission's responsibility to exercise oversight of these mortgages where abusive practices have hurt consumers. Clearly, they missed something. The FTC's authority extends to, it is my understanding, auto loans, pay-day loans, car title loans, and other non- traditional forms of credit that often flows to non-bank entities and currency exchanges. We have those in Chicago big time. It is a vital role of this subcommittee to exercise oversight over FTC and its rulemaking enforcement actions over non-bank lenders, and I look forward to working with you, our committee does, to make sure that these improvements are made as we move forward. I thank you again, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentlelady. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Georgia, Dr. Gingrey, for 2 minutes for the purposes of an opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. PHIL GINGREY, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF GEORGIA"," "
"Mr. Gingrey","Mr. Chairman, I thank you for calling the hearing today on such an important issue. It hadn't been examined in depth by this committee since 106th Congress. I join with my colleagues in congratulating the new chairman of the FTC, Jon Leibowitz, and I look forward to his testimony. I think one of the most important things as we go forward is to strike a balance. And we heard testimony from our distinguished chairman a little bit earlier in regard to, and I paraphrase, the government during the past 8 years, at least the past 8 years, has taken sort of a hands-off or soft approach to regulation to the detriment of consumers. Well, in the first 60 days of the current Administration very aggressive intervention by the government led to over $200 million of egregious loans to AIG executives, so this is I think a perfect example of why we need to strike a balance. No doubt both lenders and borrowers can share the blame for elements of the current credit climate within the economy, and as the economy begins to work toward recovery one of the basic ways in which we can work in a bipartisan manner to prevent these problems from occurring again is through consumer credit reform. Unfortunately, there will always be bad actors within the financial and credit markets, and this committee hopefully will play a role in mitigating this in the future. First and foremost, credit scams that take advantage of innocent consumers are absolutely shameful. However, before we look to expand the role and the duties of the FTC, it is imperative that we examine how the FTC could be more effective given its current and very broad set of responsibilities. Mr. Chairman, moving forward, we must ensure that there continues to be strict scrutiny and transparency within the rulemaking process of the FTC. The Magnusson-Moss rulemaking structure is unique because in order to ensure transparency it was specifically designed in the 70's to be difficult to make sporadic whimsical changes. As we are about to begin this hearing and future deliberation on the legislative changes to the FTC, I am reminded of the words of Speaker Pelosi when she took the gavel at the start of the 110th. She guaranteed that it would be the most open and honest Congress in the history of our Nation. I hope that this subcommittee takes heed of these words as we begin to modify the role. Mr. Chairman, transparency is everything, and with that I look forward to the testimony of the Honorable Jon Leibowitz, and I thank you so much for holding the hearing."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Ohio, Ms. Sutton, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. BETTY SUTTON, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF OHIO"," "
"Ms. Sutton","Thank you so much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. It is extremely important to the people that I represent in Ohio. You know, time and time again we have learned that sometimes the people who are hurt the most by what is going on out there are the ones who need our help the most. Today there are a wide range of financial products advertised to assist consumers in paying off debt and emerging from debt from pay-day lending to car title loans, short-term loans with incredibly high interest rates all but ensure that individuals remain in debt, and these individuals, many of them, are my constituents. The American people expect their government to rein in unscrupulous and unfair lending. Last November, voters in Ohio overwhelmingly improved a referendum on pay-day lenders to end predatory loans. Our referendum capped interest rates provided borrowers with more time to pay back loans and prohibited new loans to pay off old ones which will help to break that cycle of debt. However, we are now learning that these lenders are exploring new loopholes and operating under different licenses and adding new fees such as inflated check cashing fees for checks they have just printed and even as our Attorney General, Richard Cordray, and our state legislature and our governor are working to address this situation, the Federal Trade Commission must aggressively act as the American people expect. While I used Ohio as an example, this is a problem that severely impacts people in need throughout our country and if the Federal Trade Commission does not have the tools or the authority to aggressively protect Americans, then it is our responsibility to strengthen the Commission and restore Americans' confidence, and I look forward to being a part of making that happen."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentlelady. And now it is my pleasure to recognize the gentleman from Louisiana, Mr. Scalise, for the purpose of 2 minutes of opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. STEVE SCALISE, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF LOUISIANA"," "
"Mr. Scalise","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate you holding this hearing. Fraudulent and deceptive practices that prey upon consumers are deplorable and shameful especially during these tough economic times because consumers are even more vulnerable to unethical scams. We need to make sure that the FTC is fully utilizing the tools they already have available to them and also ensure that the FTC is working with our local, state attorneys general, those people that are closest in many cases to the practices of those illegal and unethical practices that are going on where we would have the ability to actually go and get prosecutions and root out the things that are being done to take advantage of our consumers in this country. Another critical issue that we need to look at is the coordination with other federal agencies like the FBI, who are also involved in some of these investigates themselves as well as local attorneys general that were not duplicating the scarce resources that we do have, so I look forward to hearing from Chairman Leibowitz of the Federal Trade Commission, and yield back the balance of my time."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes my friend, my colleague, my classmate, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 2 minutes for the purposes of opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. GENE GREEN, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF TEXAS"," "
"Mr. Green","Mr. Chairman, thank you for your friendship over the last 17 years. I thank you for holding this hearing on the consumer credit and debt protection and to look at the role that the FTC should play. I would like to welcome our new FTC chairman, Jon Leibowitz, and congratulate him on the new position as the chair of the Commission. I look forward to working with you. The FTC is important all the time but in this day and time it is even more so. As the primary federal agency that enforces consumer credit laws at entities other than banks, the thrifts and federal credit unions, the FTC has broad responsibility regarding consumer financial issues in the mortgage market including those involving mortgage lenders, brokers, and services. The FTC enforces a number of federal laws governing mortgage lending, Truth in Lending Act, the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. The Commission also enforces Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act which more generally prohibits unfair and deceptive acts or practices in the marketplace. That is probably one of the most important that we can deal with. In addition, the Commission enforces a number of other consumer protection statutes that govern financial services including Consumer Leasing Act, Fair Debt Collection Practice Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Credit Repair Organization Act, and the privacy provisions of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. I also have a particular concern about non-traditional loans such as pay-day loans and car title loans, which can carry enormous interest rates and fees. In 2006, Congress enacted to cap the pay-day loans made to military personnel to a 36 percent annual percentage rate after pay-day loans grew 34 percent to reach a total of 500 million the previous 2 years. That figures has doubled since 2002. In an economic climate such as the one we are in today where credit availability is shrinking consumers may be more inclined to turn to these options which are much less regulated and therefore the potential for predatory practice is much greater. In recent months, the FTC has taken significant steps to protect consumers and crack down on scam artists by going after Internet pay-day lenders, alleged mortgage foreclosure rescue companies, and companies claiming they remove negative information from the consumers' credit reports. I look forward to hearing what other actions the FTC is making to protect consumers, what tools it may need from Congress, and what the rest of our witnesses believe could be done better to protect consumers in today's volatile economic environment. All told, this gives the FTC broad authority to go after those predatory practices. The Congress may need to act particularly to give FTC authority to issue rules under the Administrative Procedures Act. Again, Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling the hearing, and I appreciate the opportunity."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes my friend from Florida, Mr. Stearns, for 2 minutes for the purposes of an opening statement. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF HON. CLIFF STEARNS, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF FLORIDA"," "
"Mr. Stearns","Good morning, and thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome the new chairman. Mr. Leibowitz had been on the FTC as commissioner, I think, since September, 2004, so we have someone, Mr. Chairman and members, who is experienced and can help us out. He has seen some of the problems and some of the accomplishments. Obviously, as members have talked about, the current financial situation and housing crisis has brought a lot of relevant consumer protection issues to the forefront and we need to see how much more authority we should give the Federal Trade Commission. Something that no one has mentioned is perhaps giving them more jurisdiction over the banks to credit unions and the thrifts that my colleague from Texas mentioned they do not have jurisdiction, and of course that is 75 percent of the credit cards, so I think the people across the hall here will probably not like that, but it would fall in their jurisdiction. I think it is something that we should not not discuss. The FTC has authority, but as I pointed out earlier, it is sort of limited because 75 percent of the credit cards go through credit union, banks, and thrifts. But they can issue and prohibit unfair and deceptive acts, particularly dealing with advertising. The FTC's stated goal is to protect consumers at every stage of the credit life cycle by both the FTC and consumer protection groups acknowledge that more can be done to protect consumers. And I think with his over 4 years experience as a commissioner he will certainly have some ideas that bring it to bear on this problem. The FTC has taken more aggressive action, I think, more recently against companies such as Internet pay-day lenders and credit repair companies who purposely deceive consumers, but the issue of whether the FTC should expand its jurisdiction, as I mentioned earlier, is still up in the air. It should be something of consideration. But I look forward, Mr. Chairman, in a bipartisan manner to see what we can do to help the Federal Trade Commission, and I appreciate you having this hearing. Thank you."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. Now all the members of the subcommittee have had an opportunity to issue opening statements. And it is now my distinct honor and privilege to welcome the new chairman of the FTC, Mr. Jon Leibowitz, to this committee. I want to say, Mr. Liebowitz, we are excited about your chairmanship. We look forward to working with you and look forward to having a meaningful and productive relationship on behalf of the American people. First of all, it is the practice of the subcommittee beginning with this Congress to swear in all witnesses so would you please stand up and raise your right hand? "
"Mr. Rush","Let the record reflect that the witnesses all answered in the affirmative. Chairman Leibowitz, you are now recognized for 5 minutes for purposes of an opening statement. "
"TESTIMONY OF HONORABLE JON LEIBOWITZ, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION"," "
"Mr. Leibowitz","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Radanovich, Ms. Schakowsky, members of the subcommittee, I am Jon Leibowitz. I am the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission, and I really do appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to discuss the FTC's role in protecting consumers from predatory financial practices. This is my first hearing of several you mentioned, and let me just say this. You are an authorizing committee. We want to work with all of you. We will not be successful agency unless we can work together, and I hope that we will be doing that over the coming weeks and months. The Commission's views are set forth in the written testimony which was approved by a vote of the entire Commission, though my answers to your questions represent my own views. Mr. Chairman, during these times of difficulty for so many American consumers, the FTC is working hard. Whether Americans are trying to stave off foreclosure, lower their monthly mortgage payments or deal with abusive debt collectors the FTC is on the job enforcing the law, offering guidance, and in the process of issuing new regulations. The written testimony describes in great detail the Commission's enforcement, education, and policy tools and how we have used those tools to protect and advocate for consumers of financial services. We brought about 70 cases involving financial services since I came to the Commission 4-1/2 years ago, and we have gotten $465 million in redress for consumers over the past 10 years in this area alone. But let me highlight just a few recent cases. In the fall, Bear Stearns and its EMC subsidiary paid $28 million to settle Federal Trade Commission charges of illegal mortgage servicing practices. For example, they misrepresented the amounts consumers owed. They collected unauthorized fees. They made harassing and deceptive collection calls. In January we sent out more than 86,000 redress checks, 86,000, to reimburse consumers who were harmed. And today the FTC announced two more cases against so-called mortgage rescue operations that allegedly charged thousands of dollars in upfront fees but failed to provide any assistance in saving people's homes. Even worse, these scurrilous companies Hope Now and New Hope gave consumers false hope by impersonating the HUD- endorsed Hope Now alliance, which helps borrowers with free debt management and credit counseling services, mostly low income consumers. I am pleased to report that the courts have issued temporary restraining orders stopping these fraudulent claims and freezing the company's assets. We are announcing a third action today against yet another rogue rescue scam. Less than 2 weeks ago, FTC investigators discovered a foreclosure rescue web site that was impersonating the HUD web site itself. The HUD inspector general had the site taken down. Last week, however, we were told that the same site had popped up again on a differed ISP. Within hours, we filed a complaint against the unknown operators of the site, and armed with a court order we shut it down. Let me assure you, particularly in this economic climate the FTC will continue to target fraudulent mortgage rescue operations, but we can do better and we will. Mr. Chairman, you mentioned the lack of statutory authority, the one hand tied behind our back. First, we are going to vigorously enforce new mortgage rules issued by the Federal Reserve Board that go into effect this fall that will prohibit a variety of unfair, deceptive, and abusive mortgage advertising, lending, appraisal, and servicing practices such as banning sub-prime buyer's loans. Second, the 2009 Omnibus Appropriations Act gave us authority to find violators in this area for the first time. And, third, we are going to use the regulatory authority given to use by the Omnibus to issue new regulations that will protect consumers from other predatory mortgage practices. We expect these rules to address foreclosure rescue scams and unfair and deceptive mortgage modification and servicing practices. At the same time, we are going to focus more attention on empirical research about how to make mortgages and other disclosures more effective so that consumers have accurate, easily understandable information about a mortgage's terms. We have put a prototype disclosure form on your desks. It is clearly better, and we have copy tested this, than what people are using under current law. But we could use more help. FTC law enforcement would be a greater deterrent if we were able to obtain civil penalties for all unfair and deceptive acts and practices related to financial services beyond mortgages, for example, in-house debt collection and debt negotiation. The FTC could also do more to assist consumers if it could use streamlined APA rulemaking procedures to promulgate rules for unfair acts and practices related to financial services other than mortgage loans. These steps, of course, would require congressional action. They may perhaps require some more resources. Will all these measures be enough? Well, they could certainly help to ensure that we are never in this kind of economic mess again. Finally, Mr. Chairman, as you know, right now jurisdiction is balkanized between the FTC and the banking agencies about who protects American consumers from deceptive financial practices. Several bills have been introduced that call for an overall federal consumer protection regulator of financial services. As discussions about these proposals continue, we urge you to keep this in mind. The FTC, the Commission, has unparalleled expertise in consumer protection. That is what we do. We are not beholding to any providers of financial services, and we have substantial experience effectively and cooperating working with the states, especially cooperatively working with the states. In short, if your committee and if Congress determines that such an overall federal regulator is needed, if you do, we ask that the FTC be an integral part of the discussion about how to best protect the American public. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to speak today about what the FTC has done and what we are going to do. We look forward to working with this committee, and I am pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.  "

"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the chairman. The chair recognizes himself for 5 minutes for the purposes of questioning our witness. Chairman Leibowitz, during the housing boom the FTC had clear jurisdiction over many of the worse predatory lenders with the most objectionable practices, but the Commission arguably didn't do much to address any of these activities. As a matter of fact, it was the states that successfully brought actions against lenders such as Countrywide and AmeriQuest when there are abusive lending practices in the sub-prime mortgage market. In the second panel Attorney Jim Tierney will talk about these and other issues a little more. But to begin with, I want to ask a simple question to you. What happened at the FTC? Why did the FTC not take aggressive action against mortgage lenders in the earlier part of this decade?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, Mr. Chairman, I would say sometimes the simple questions are the most difficult ones to answer, but let me try to respond. First of all, I think, as you know, we are a tiny agency by Washington standards. We have 270 attorneys doing consumer protection. And, as Mr. Radanovich and others mentioned, we cover the entire waterfront of the economy with a few exceptions like common carriers. So we have to--and we spent a lot of time doing things like stopping fraud, going after spyware, you know, because we talked about that together. Having said that, I think we did a pretty good job. You know, we brought 75 cases in the last 5 years. We have gotten in the last 10 years $465 million in consumer redress, and that is just in this area of financial services alone. Could we have done more? Yes, I think we could have done more. Will we do more in the future? Yes. And do we need to work with the state attorneys general? Yes, and we do it all the time. We are part of several regional task forces. The director of or Atlanta office or southeastern regional office has actually set up a task force with state AGs, and they are going after predatory lending. But, yes, we can do more. I have been exchanging phone calls with Attorney General Holder about resurrecting something called the Executive Working Group, which involved the Federal Trade Commission, the state AGs, and the Justice Department. And it was something that was used in the 1990s and the 1980s to sort of coordinate efforts. I think we are going to resurrect that, and I think that would be--you can ask Attorney General Tierney, but I believe that that will be something that is welcome by all the state AGs, and it will allow us to help coordinate even more."
"Mr. Rush","You asked for new authority for the FTC such as additional rulemaking authority, the ability to seek civil penalties, and possibly additional authority over banks and other depository institutions. But there are critics, and some of them are on this panel, or the next panel rather, and they argue that the Commission hasn't been aggressively using the authority it already has. My question is given the FTC's record over the past 8 years, why should we give this authority to you now? How can you assure us that you will use these authorities to aggressively protect American consumers?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I think, you know, you raise a very fair question, but I would say this. We are hamstrung, speaking for myself, we are hamstrung by the Magnusson-Moss rulemaking process. When you pass laws like Can-Spam, Gramm-Leach-Bliley, FACTA, you have given us APA rulemaking authority so that we can do rules more quickly. But in a Mag-Moss rule, and I think Mr. Radanovich raised the rationale for making rulemaking, and Congressman Stearns too, we are making rulemaking more complicated under Mag-Moss. It is a legitimate argument. But what we have found is that sometimes it takes 6 or 8 years to do rulemakings, and when it takes 6 or 8 years to do rulemakings, it is impossible to do a rulemaking in a timely manner to stop or to respond to a crisis. So, for example, 2 years ago we did a sweep of Internet advertising for mortgages, and we found facially deceptive ads, over 200 different companies on the Internet. And the commissioners had discussions about what should we do about this. Well, we ended up bringing some cases against the worse malefactors. We wrote letters to everybody. Some people cleaned up their work. But we couldn't do a rulemaking because under Mag-Ross rules by the time we started or finished the rulemaking, we knew that Congress would legislate in this area, as they should. And so if we could have some relief from Mag- Moss, I think we can be more effective in helping consumers. And it is a legitimate debate. I think when you reach reauthorization, which I know you want to do this year, we will have a discussion about the broader--about broader Mag-Moss rulemaking relief and finding malefactors. But again you can be much more effective if you have fining authority, which we don't have for violations of Section 5. You can be much more effective if you can do some sort of streamline rulemaking authority too."
"Mr. Rush","My time is up, but I want to inform the members of the subcommittee if the chairman will indulge us, we want to go through a second round of questioning. The chair now recognizes the gentleman from California for 5 minutes, Mr. Radanovich."
"Mr. Radanovich","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Mr. Leibowitz, to this subcommittee. Congratulations on your recent appointment. I did want to ask a couple questions. This first one, I am going to ask about five questions to the subject matter about why would you like the FTC to have an APA notice and comment rulemaking to define unfair deceptive acts for financial services. Why isn't the current Section 5 authority sufficient?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, it is two things. First of all, in the Omnibus Act we have a fining authority for the rules that the fed issued under the FTC Act and rulemaking authority. We are going to use that to go after deceptive and unfair mortgage servicing and in some other areas. Why do we want expanded rulemaking authority? Because we think when you write rules, you can set standards for an entire industry, and here where you have--where you have many, many actors it is better to try to set standards, and also we have seen a pattern and practice of bad behavior by many companies. Not all, but many. And so we think it would be helpful. It would make us a more effective agency."
"Mr. Radanovich","Do you have thoughts on what kind of rules you would like to propose for the activities that are not already covered under existing statutes?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","We do. I think debt negotiation would be one area. We would want to work with the committee in thinking about other areas, but, yes, we do and we can get back to you with some more thoughts on that."
"Mr. Radanovich","OK. What would be the most prevalent consumer fraud violations in financial services that you think the FTC should be pursuing that it currently can't?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I mean I guess I would say this. We found a fair amount of fraud in the entire life cycle of the mortgage instrument, and when you have an economic downturn as severe as the one that we are in now, I think there is more of an incentive to see more of this, so we are--in the mortgage area we now have that rulemaking authority that was given to us in the Omnibus. We think that is going to be helpful. We think we are going to be able to find malefactors and write good rules, but I think--and we have deployed more resources. We have really doubled our resources in the last 2 years to go after predatory financial practices. Having said that, there is just no shortage of bad acts that we could look at in this area. Most companies, of course, do the right thing but there are a lot of people who have just been ripping off consumers and the cases that we brought today sort of attest to that."
"Mr. Radanovich","Right. Yes. And I will get on to those cases that you brought in just a second. One more quick question though. Why can't the Commission use your existing authority to propose rules defining unfair acts and practices for financial services? Why can't you use what you have now?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, again, we could do it, but if they are not--if it is not under APA rulemaking, notice and comment rulemaking, then it takes us literally years to do the rulemaking. I don't think that serves the American people well. I don't think it effectuates what you want us to effectuate on this committee."
"Mr. Radanovich","OK. Thanks. Now with regard to the cases that you mentioned that you have presented a very good record of the cases that the Commission has brought under a multitude of laws that you already have to enforce but unscrupulous actors continue to violate the law. Will more laws or rules reduce that fraud?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","I think, look, and we will have some of this discussion going forward when you look at our reauthorization, and growing the agency would be something that would be enormously important. We have about 1,100 employees. We do anti-trust and consumer protection. In 1980, we had 1,800 employees and the population of the United States was a third smaller than it is now. So part of it is more resources, but I also think part of it is the ability to have--the ability to have rulemaking authority."
"Mr. Radanovich","And you have to balance this idea of dealing with the bad actors and there may be more of them out there, you know, during this financial crisis or not. I don't know how you measure how many bad actors are out there, but the other side of over enforcement is higher compliance costs, and where do you find the balance to where you are regulating so much that, you know, we have higher cost of goods out there as a result of it?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, Congressman, you are right. We have to strike the right balance, and reasonable people can disagree about exactly where that balance should be. But, look, we have brought 68 cases in the last 5 years in the financial services area against malefactors. We have no fining authority. Forty- seven attorneys general, I believe, have fining authority to go after people who violate the law, and so fining authority is something you get for violating a rule and that would make us much--that would be an very important tool in our arsenal. And, by the way, when you pass pieces of legislation like Can-Spam, which came out of this committee, you have given us that fining authority, at least for specific matters. So it is a discussion we want to have with you going forward but that would be one thing that would make us more effective, I think."
"Mr. Radanovich","All right. Thank you for your answers. And thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from California, Ms. Matsui, for 5 minutes for questioning."
"Ms. Matsui","Chairman Leibowitz, as I mentioned in my opening statement, the issue of loan modification scams is a growing problem, particularly in California where we have the highest number of homes going into foreclosure. We hear individuals and companies advertising on radio and television with a simple message that they can lower your mortgage payments, stop your foreclosure. And many of these people are calling themselves foreclosure consultants or in some cases acting like they were government agencies like HUD. They make guarantees and promises to homeowners seeking help to save their home, but this help usually comes with a price tag in the form of an advanced fee between $1,500 up to $9,000. That being said, I would like to hear what the FTC is doing to crack down on these fraudulent loan modification scams. In your written testimony, you announced two new cases targeting mortgage foreclosure rescue scams bringing the total to eight such cases. Is enforcement the right approach to ending this type of fraud? You initiated 8 cases. Will those cases serve as a deterrent to other scammers and other steps that the FTC can take to end these practices?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, that is a great question, and we do think that these--and, by the way, I should mention that we are also members of the Sacramento Task Force and many task forces in your districts around the country. Well, I do think that the cases against Hope Now and New Hope, which are two entities that are claiming to be affiliated with the Hope Now alliance, are ones that will be helpful as a deterrent but we also think that rulemaking authority and fining authority will make our ability to deter more effective. And again we want to do rules because they are needed in the mortgage servicing area, in the mortgage modification, and rescue area, and going after rescue scams. So we would like to be able to use the whole arsenal. We have been given some authority in the Omnibus Appropriations Act that will be helpful. We are looking for more authority from this committee and we want to move forward with that if the committee believes it is appropriate."
"Ms. Matsui","OK. Some examples of fraudulent schemes are, as we mentioned, advance fee scams where, you know, consumers are charged for services that are never rendered, and in exchange for this fee, it is up from $1,500 to $9,000, homeowners are promised guarantees to save their homes. In some cases, consumers usually pay these fees with a credit card, which should make it easier to track the payment and help the consumer recoup their money. What is the government doing to help recoup these advance fees to make consumers whole again, and is there a mechanism in place to help consumers recoup their advance fees?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Sure. I mean when we bring these cases, and, by the way, the Hope Now case is a case that involved an advance fee of $1,000 to $1,500. My understanding is that when consumers--consumers got no help whatsoever or very little assistance. When they asked for their money back, it was done. So when we bring these cases, we try to ask for a disgorgement of profits. We try to get redress to consumers. In the case we brought against Bear Stearns as a subsidiary, EMC we got 86,000 redress checks issued. But it is tough because sometimes these assets dissipate and sometimes it is hard to determine, you know, not in these cases but in other cases which ones were fraudulently made or which advertisements were deceptive and which ones weren't and that is why a penalty authority will be very helpful to us if we can get it."
"Ms. Matsui","Well, do you think Congress should ban these advance fees?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","I would want to come back--I would want to think about that. I would want to think about that. We certainly see experience--we certainly had experience with these advance fee scams including advance fee credit card scams that make us think that certainly the practice of a lot of companies should be prohibited. But as far as advance fees generally in the financial services area, I would want to think about that because there may be some value when legitimate companies are doing some things with advance fees."
"Ms. Matsui","So would you think then that the FTC should declare its view that it is an unfair practice to charge an advance fee for services that do nothing to save a home?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I would certainly think that we could look at that in the context of our rulemaking and some states, I believe, so ban advance fees in the financial services area so it is something we can take a look at. I think we probably should in the context of any rulemaking authority we have been given in the Omnibus or that you give us additionally."
"Ms. Matsui","Well, thank you very much, and I see my time is up. Thank you."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Nebraska, Mr. Lee Terry."
"Mr. Terry","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate this. The gentlelady brings up, I think, several good points, and I think really gets to the heart of the matter, and that is if we are going to stream line rules, the procedures for the rules, we want to make sure that it is going to be effective in protecting consumers and that you will be able to use the FTC's authority. But the argument here about advance fees begs the question of who is ultimately going to be able to decide what is deceptive and what is not. Sometimes it is obvious where you can put 100 people together and they will say that practice is deceptive. There are other things like maybe advance fees that some people will say are deceptive or that are wrong, but they are not deceptive. And so how are we going to split those hairs if you are coming to us and asking us to streamline the rules or the procedures to make your rulemaking. Who should have the authority in there to determine which specific practice is deceptive or not deceptive?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I think that is right and in some practices maybe deceptive as practiced by some companies whereas other companies may do them in a legitimate way."
"Mr. Terry","That is why it is really----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Right. It is a good question and whether we have--whether we are bringing cases or whether we are enforcing rules that we promulgated, we have to go before a federal judge, so there is that mechanism as a check and balance against any excesses of the FTC, but I don't believe anybody has suggested at least in the last 25 years that we have engaged in any excesses at our agency. I think people think that we are a pretty good--I think people think that we are a pretty good agency and we try to do the right things with our limited resources and leverage of resources."
"Mr. Terry","In specific about streamlining the rule process so you can be more nimble, do you have specifics for us or is that just kind of a general statement that would be helpful for you?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I think it is both in the sense that if we have a--if we have more agile rulemaking, something closer to APA rulemaking, we can respond more quickly. I do think that we are going to, you know, use the APA rulemaking authority given to us in the Omnibus Act to address foreclosure rescue scams where we know there are very, very serious problems, mortgage modification where we know there are problems. We know that both because we have testified to it and others have, and also because of the Bear Stearns case where we saw lots of embedded fees that consumers just didn't know about and are being hit with."
"Mr. Terry","Yes, those get to be fairly obvious."
"Mr. Leibowitz","And let me just add my point to that that advance fees are prohibited under CROA. We prohibit the under the telemarketing sales rules which is an FTC rule, and in some instances, not in every, but in some instances it has really sort of helped clean up bad practices that harm consumers."
"Mr. Terry","All right. And those were developed within your own rules? You decided in those instances----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","The telemarketing sales rules were promulgated by us pursuant to legislation enacted by Congress in the early 1990's, I believe."
"Mr. Terry","Right. But for those specific instances with the specifics of advance fees, that was something that you did within the FTC by rulemaking?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Yes, that is exactly right."
"Mr. Terry","And that is the point that I am getting to. I guess there are two sides of the coin that we can look at here and one is we can criticize the FTC over the last 8 years for not being aggressive enough. Eight years from now are we going to look back at the FTC when we streamline your rules and say you were overly aggressive and without specific congressional approval defining general practices as deceptive practices thereby freezing trade?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Look, it is a fair question but I think in these times of, you know, where we have seen so much harm to consumers by deceptive acts and practices, you might want to-- given that we are an agency that has a track record for being aggressive but balanced, you might want to err on the side of giving us more authority. Believe me, in the 1960's and 70's Congress was always able to pare us back when they thought we were going a little bit too far. But, again, you know, in areas like debt collection, in-house debt collection where we have seen problems including in the Bear Stearns case and debt negotiation, those would be areas not covered by the Omnibus where we think we could do----"
"Mr. Terry","In my last 14 seconds, I am just very curious, in the last several years in the financial services area you have brought 40 or 60----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Sixty-eight cases."
"Mr. Terry","Sixty-eight complaints. Generally what were those? What is the major area?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","It is really a combination of different areas. It is 7 mortgage advertising, 5 pay-day loan cases--6 pay-day loan cases, a couple of fair lending cases, mortgage servicing cases, 9 foreclosure rescue scam cases, and 12 credit counseling cases, and 11 debt collection cases. Those are the-- and, sorry, 17 credit repair cases as well. So it is a combination of--it is different areas mostly within our financial services group, and then we have had our regions. We have 7 regional offices around the country doing more in this area because it is a high priority for us."
"Mr. Rush","The gentleman's time is up. The chair now recognizes the vice chair of the subcommittee, Ms. Schakowsky, for 5 minutes."
"Ms. Schakowsky","Thank you. Chairman Leibowitz, since 2001, state attorneys general have been active, often aggressively pursuing the bad actors in the field of consumer credit. They took the lead on cases like Household Finance, AmeriQuest, Countrywide, and uncovered extensive abusive practices, inflated appraisals, fabricated income statements, misrepresentations to borrowers, illegal and deceptive fees, and rates. Was the FTC approached to participate in these activities?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","You know, some of those cases took place before I came to the Commission. I believe in AmeriQuest, which is a terrific case by the state AGs, we approached them about whether they needed our help because we are always happy to help with cases and we work a lot with state AGs, and I think that they were--I think that they demurred on that, that they were----"
"Ms. Schakowsky","But my understanding that in fact the Commission has often opted not to participate. In fact, a former attorney general, James Tierney, who will be sitting on our second panel, in his testimony he states that the past 8 years have been a time of limited cooperation between the FTC and state attorneys general with respect to enforcing consumer protection in the areas of consumer credit, and so would you agree with this assessment?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I would say this. I can't speak for the first four--from 2000 to 2004. I wasn't at the Commission. From 2005 through now, we have been working fairly often with the states. We are involved in regional task forces. But, look, we can certainly step it up and we certainly will. And one of the things I am very heartened about is our very positive conversations with Attorney General Holder about resurrecting the executive working group, which had sort of--which was very active in the 1990's and sort of was flailing in the last 8 years. It is a way for us to help coordinate with the Justice Department and with state AGs through regular meetings, regular consumer protection activities, so I think that will be a big plus."
"Ms. Schakowsky","Wonderful. Let me talk about a different area. Under Section 18 of the FTC Act whenever the Commission promulgates a rule on unfair or deceptive acts of practices dealing with consumer credit matters the Federal Reserve and other banking agencies are required to promulgate a similar rule for depository institutions or explain why such a rule is unnecessary. So were we to give the FTC speedier APA rulemaking under Section 18 of the FTC Act, would this not ameliorate at least somewhat the lack of functional or regulatory parity because of the reciprocal requirements under Section 18 whereby banking agencies have to consider the FTC's lead?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, Congresswoman, it might very well be helpful but I think what your question touches on, and I know you know this, is the sort of incredible balkanization, right?"
"Ms. Schakowsky","Right."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Consumers don't know whether they got-- consumers don't care whether they got a mortgage from a bank or whether it came from a mortgage, a non-bank mortgage."
"Ms. Schakowsky","Right."
"Mr. Leibowitz","If it is deceptive, if it is, you now, a sub-prime loan or a non sub-prime loan with hidden fees that they don't know about, it is hurting them. So we have a sort of balkanization of authority here. There are three or four different banking entities or banking agencies that have some jurisdiction over the 60 percent of the mortgages that are issued by banks. We have jurisdiction over the others. And I think that is why Elizabeth Warren and the professor at Harvard and a variety of folks on the hill are thinking, you know, that it may be time to have one single entity that protects consumers from predatory financial instruments. And certainly I know people on this committee are thinking about that, and I want to make sure that you know from our perspective we are a consumer protection agency."
"Ms. Schakowsky","So you could do banks as well is what you are saying?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","We could do banks as well, I would say with this qualification. The banking agencies, you know, they are mostly concerned with safety and soundness. We don't do safety and soundness. We are not those kinds of bank regulators but if you want an entity to do consumer protection for consumers who have financial instruments, we can do that really, really well."
"Ms. Schakowsky","Let me ask the final thing."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Sure."
"Ms. Schakowsky","There was a colloquy on the Senate floor that clarified the authority that is this trigger under Section 18 was not under Section 18 and only applied to non-banks. Do you see this if it goes forward as a missed opportunity?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, you know, do I personally see this as a missed opportunity? I certainly think Congress needs to look at the notion of a single entity whether it is housed in the FTC or whether it is a new one to protect consumers from predatory financial instruments, deceptive and unfair ones. I see this as actually an opportunity for us because the language in the Omnibus Appropriations Act gives us rulemaking throughout the entire life cycle of a mortgage only of course for non-bank issued mortgages. But that is a real opportunity to do rulemaking, and after we do rulemaking to actually be able to have standards, get those from rules, and to find malefactors who fall below those standards. So I see your point, and we are very supportive of Congress having a discussion about creating an entity to protect consumers here, but I also think we have been struggling for this legislation for quite some time. It is going to be helpful to us."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Ohio, Ms. Sutton, for 5 minutes."
"Ms. Sutton","Thank you so much, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your commitment to look after the entire life cycle of credit. There are so many questions that I have, I am going to probably going to need to follow up after the course of this hearing to try and unravel exactly what is going on out there because I can tell you that my constituents are feeling the effects of all of this confusion. It is kind of confusing for anyone who is watching this hearing to figure out who has authority over what, and who has the responsibility to protect them let alone, you know, know where to turn. So in the last line of questioning from my distinguished colleague, Representative Schakowsky, we are talking about the new opportunity you have within limits for rulemaking. But if I was to ask you this question, it sounds to me like you have limited opportunity for rulemaking that will provide some people protection but there is whole other category of people out there who may be suffering from the very same thing and the same practices over which you have no ability to help them, is that correct?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","That is correct."
"Ms. Sutton","Let me go on record as saying I don't think that makes any sense."
"Mr. Leibowitz","That makes a lot of sense, and again in going back to Ms. Schakowsky's questions, one of the other things that is sort of peculiar about this rulemaking is that the fed can enact, promulgate rules under the FTC Act by notice and comment rulemaking, APA rulemaking, the simple rulemaking that we can then enforce for over non-bank mortgage companies, over non-bank issued mortgages. But if we want to do that rulemaking right now, it would have to be under Magnusson-Moss and it would never get done because contested rulemakings under Magnusson-Moss just don't get done, so we are glad that they promulgated these rules. We are glad we can enforce them. We think those rules are going to be helpful in curbing bad advertising and things like liar's loans but it is like trying to--even for the Commission, and all the commissioners are very, very hard working, you know it is like running through a rabbit warren to try to figure out how these laws interact and regulations interact with each other."
"Ms. Sutton","Well, again, I appreciate that very much because it seems like we should be able to inject some more sense into the process and into this puzzle. In your testimony on page 8 you talked about suing a credit card marketing company. Obviously, you can reach the credit card marketing company. Can you tell me what exactly is a credit card marketing company?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, we can't reach--as you know, we can't reach bank issued credit cards, which is about, I think someone said 75 percent. I think it is now probably up to about 95 percent. So a credit card marketing company is simply a non- bank affiliate or surrogate that markets the credit card, and what we found with some of our advance fee cases is they will say you can have a credit card, give us $500, and then when you give them $500 some of it is taken away by fees, by prohibitive monthly costs or you can only use the credit card to buy from their catalog, so those are some of the types of cases we have brought. And then we had a major case involving a company called CompuCredit, which we brought jointly with the banking agencies where they had--and it was a credit card company that actually targeted sub-prime borrowers, people who couldn't otherwise get credit, so that is sort of laudatory at some level. But the credit card limit was $300, and the first month had $185 in fees, which weren't accurately disclosed we alleged, and we had a settlement for $115 million for consumers just the end of last year. That was very, very important for us."
"Ms. Sutton","OK. So the question that I have though is if a bank is engaging in the exact same activity, can you do anything about it?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","You know, we could run across the hall to the banking agencies where they are testifying and tell them they should take a look at it. We can go talk to them, but we can't do anything about it."
"Ms. Sutton","That is my point, and that is my concern. OK. Mr. Chairman, I will hold my questions at this point until the next round."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentlelady. The chair now recognizes my friend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Pitts, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Pitts","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Leibowitz, as an overwhelming number of mortgage fraud cases began to surface in 2007 the FBI formed a financial crimes task force and has had more cases than it can handle, and these are largely criminal fraud cases. Does the FTC have a role in investigating these cases? If so, would you elaborate?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","I want to get back to you on those cases. We do a lot of work with the postal inspectors. We do some work with the FBI, of course, but when we see something that is criminal we generally refer it to the Justice Department, and if they will take it they have more appropriate sanctions than we do. We generally can only get redress and disgorgement and stop the bad conduct, so sometimes we are sort of the fallback entity for going after fraudulent behavior in this area, but I will get back to you on whether we have worked with the FBI task force specifically."
"Mr. Pitts","OK. Thank you. The Commission has conducted research on ways to improve mortgage disclosure. If the disclosure documents were simplified in a manner that provided relevant information similar to the prototype disclosure developed by the Commission, would that have prevented any of the fraud that occurred in the home mortgage loan market in your opinion or might fraudsters simply find a way around that simplified uniform disclosure?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I would say this. Fraudsters, you know, can often find a way around even simplified disclosures, and I hope all of you have the draft disclosure form on your desk. If not, we will make sure we get you copies. But sometimes what is happening is that consumers don't see imbedded fees, and what we have done with our sort of disclosure form, it is simple. We have copy tested it. In other words, we have asked consumers to look at this and compare it to the existing HUD, RESPA and TILA forms that they use. And those forms have both--they are both over inclusive and under inclusive. They have too much information so consumers don't know what to focus on, and they don't focus on some specific aspects of information. So can I say to you that it would prohibit--it would have stopped a specific fraud? I don't think so. But would it have sort of helped some consumers make more informed decisions when they are dealing maybe not with deception but more with unfairness? We think it might have. And even, by the way, for consumers these forms or this draft form and others like it, it doesn't just help the consumer who is being ripped off. It helps the consumer who wants to be able to make informed choices, and say, well, here, you know, the fees are going to be more and here the fees will be--here the fees and the overall cost of the loan will be less. So that is just helping consumers like all of us make choices from among competitors."
"Mr. Pitts","The FTC prohibits both unfair and deceptive practices."
"Mr. Leibowitz","That is correct."
"Mr. Pitts","Unfair is defined as any act that causes or is likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers themselves and not outweighed by countervailing benefits to consumers or to competition. Bringing an enforcement action for violation of a deceptive practice is much more common for the FTC. Why are unfair cases brought so infrequently?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I think, you know, you articulated--I think you read directly from the statutory authority we have. It is harder to show unfairness. Unfairness is sometimes a more amorphous term, so when we see--when we are going after a typical bottom feeder who is ripping off consumers, we just see it is clear deception. But sometimes, for example, in our spyware cases and in a variety of our other cases involving data security and Internet-related problems, we will use unfairness. We have been using it actually more in the last several years because we think it is important."
"Mr. Pitts","Should unfair acts be better defined to provide greater certainty to make enforcement easier?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","I would say certainly if we had a little more leverage in our unfairness standard, we might be able to bring unfairness cases more often. We had a much broader standard in the 1960s and 1970s, and through the late 1970s, and then Congress asked us to modify first of our own volition and then it put it in the statute, I think, in 1992, our unfairness authority. So this has been the subject of some debate going back and forth about whether we should have a little more flexibility here. We would love to work with you on this."
"Mr. Pitts","Thank you. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, an issue came up just now, and I was going to ask you, is there any numbers that the FTC could share with the committee on the number of criminal prosecutions it referred to the Justice Department that actually are taken by the Justice Department because I think that is something we would like to see."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Yes, we will get you--we will get you that information. We do have Tim Yuris, who is the first chairman under Chairman Bush, set up a criminal liaison unit and which we still have and which takes some of the cases that are clearly of a criminal nature where we started investigations and sends it over to the Justice Department or to certain other prosecutors, so we can get you that information. Some of it-- with the caveat that I have to go back and look. Some of it may be confidential. And then sometimes, again, as you know from the cases because you know our agency----"
"Mr. Green","We just need the numbers."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Yes, we will get them."
"Mr. Green","The percentages, and if there are cases that are definitely not controversial, it would be interesting to see what type of cases may not be accepted and what type would be."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Right. I can just tell you as a general matter sometimes the cases don't rise to the level of ones that the Justice Department wants to prosecute so we do it ourselves."
"Mr. Green","OK. And you have the ability to do it yourself?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Not as a criminal matter but as a civil matter so to stop ongoing harm."
"Mr. Green","Our office has been hearing from constituents concerned that the free credit reports do not list all the information that credit lending entities have access to. Do you know if there is a case and, if so, do you believe consumers should have access to all this information? It seems that consumers should have access to all the credit information available to them. Have you heard of that or has that been an issue with the FTC?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Yes. We brought a case, I think in 2002-2003 before I got to the Commission freecreditreport.com. I think I am summarizing it but I believe they are actually charging fees. There is a place where consumers can go to get a free credit report without entering into a contract, a monthly contract, and I think that is called annual credit report. And we actually, not to make light of this, but we actually put out a spoof of freecreditreport.com that got picked up by You Tube and by a variety of other media outlets just 2 weeks ago. So this is an area of some concern to us, and I know the consumers--we do get complaints on this."
"Mr. Green","That is what I was going to say. There may be things that the consumer may not--that is not on that report that is being used for their credit rating."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Credit source, are you talking about credit source? Yes, they are included in the free credit report."
"Mr. Green","And is there any restriction on what can be considered to go into your credit score either by practice or by rule or statute?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Let me, Congressman, get back to you on that. It is a legitimate question and I want to give you the right answer."
"Mr. Green","I know I only have a minute left, but there are many varieties of mortgage foreclosure rescue fraud but in each case the perpetrator makes misleading promises that the consumer's home will be safe from pending foreclosure permanently. Most consumers end up losing their home, however, as well as the money they paid to these scammers. I am aware the FTC took action in February to sue a company operating one of these scams, and I commend you for that. How widespread is the problem and does the Commission have the tools and resources to go after a lot of bad actors, not only the ones you see but it seems like some of it may be cottage industries that we are seeing in regional areas and not maybe national."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Right. Well, with the entity that we just brought an action against today that is impersonating HUD, we are having sort of a whack-a-mole problem with them because we found the site. We found the site. The HUD inspector general took it down. Then it popped up again under a web site from Germany, registered in Germany, and then we have taken that site down, so we have a little long arm problem in terms of asserting our jurisdiction. The other thing is that if we can find these malefactors which the Omnibus Appropriations Act will let us do or provision that Senator Jorgen got into the Omnibus Appropriations Act will let us do, I think that would be very, very helpful, and we will do a rulemaking on foreclosure rescue scams and also deceptive modifications."
"Mr. Green","If you would share that with us even though we are not a writer of the appropriations bill and maybe not rise to the need for an authorization, but some of us could help with getting the encouragement of the appropriators to include that."
"Mr. Leibowitz","We would love to work with you. We would love to help."
"Mr. Green","Thank you."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now recognizes the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Stupak, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Stupak","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Leibowitz, thanks for being here. The Commission, as you have indicated, has authority under Section 18 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, and I understand it is particularly cumbersome. Instead of promulgating rules under the APA, the Commission must go through a far more difficult process known as the Magnusson- Moss Act. So my question is since you have been chair, has the Commission considered promulgating the rule under the Magnusson-Moss Act or have you just sort of disregarded the whole process?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","We have a few rules that we are in the process of promulgating outside of this area under Mag-Moss, but they are generally sort of not good government rules but non-controversial rules because under Mag-Moss if you want to promulgate a rule and there is an opposition to that rule they get to require an independent referee, multiple rounds of submissions, and it takes a really long time."
"Mr. Stupak","Do you think Congress should just repeal that?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","I would say this. There are probably some legitimate reasons why Congress gave us this cumbersome rulemaking."
"Mr. Stupak","Can you give me one reason why they would give you such a burdensome procedure if our purposes----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Off the top of my head, no, but I would say this. I certainly think some relief from Magnusson-Moss would be justified. I think the original--look, we are an agency that Congress wanted to give us when they created us in 1914 enormously broad jurisdiction but fairly limited remedies, as opposed to the Justice Department where they have to go after more specific crimes and they put people in jail. They have fining authority. And so the rationale for Mag-Moss, I suppose, is that it sort of slows things down because we have such broad jurisdiction. I do think over time what we found is that some relief to Mag-Moss would be helpful in allowing us to have leverage over the bad guys. So, for example, I think 47 attorneys--when you promulgate a rule, you can get a fine for a violation of a rule. Otherwise, when we use our Section 530, you can't do that, and so if we can find malefactors as 47 attorneys general can do, that would make us more effective in doing what you want us to do, which is protecting consumers."
"Mr. Stupak","In order to protect consumers, you have to move quicker. I mean we don't want you to be the Justice Department, you indicated you don't have fines and all that, but isn't really your power is to look for that unfair and deceptive practices and act quickly to cease and desist. Isn't that really the role of the FTC? It seems like Magnusson-Moss is just the opposite. It slows you down so you cannot be nimble and react to current trends."
"Mr. Leibowitz","That is exactly right. In a controversial rulemaking, you know, in a rulemaking where there is opposition, and many good rulemakings have opposition, you know, we would always look to see what all stakeholders want. Of course we are going to do that, and we are going to do that in the rulemakings that we got in the Omnibus Appropriations which will be APA rulemakings."
"Mr. Stupak","Right, but even that is limited in the Omnibus. Your rulemaking authority, that is somewhat limited, is it not?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","It is limited. It applies to mortgages but not other financial instruments not issued by banks, and of course it only goes to non-bank issued mortgages, but it is still better than what we had so we are very grateful for it and we thank this committee for protecting it in the Omnibus."
"Mr. Stupak","Well, let me ask you this. Since 2001, the attorneys general have been active and very aggressive in pursuing bad actors in the field of consumer credit. They took the lead on cases against Household Finance, AmeriQuest and Countrywide, and uncovered extensive abuse of practices, inflated appraisals, fabricated income statements, misrepresentations of borrowers, and illegal and deceptive fees and rates. Was the FTC approached to participate with the AGs in their----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","In some cases we have, and we have participated with them. In some cases, they have done it on their own, and I believe demurred when we offered help. And then probably there are some cases again in hindsight that we should have been involved in earlier but they took the lead. The attorneys general have been terrific in protecting consumers. I don't think we have been slackers at all. I think we have been pretty good but on a going forward basis we are going to work more with the attorneys general."
"Mr. Stupak","OK. So how do you envision working closer relationship between the states as you are now the newly appointed chairmanship because I think it is important while the states bring forth but sometimes they look to you for resources and to help them with these investigations, and I would think what goes on in one part of the country is probably going on in the other part of the country and therefore the FTC should be more involved and should have a closer working relationship with the state AGs."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I absolutely hear that, and of course we can have--it is easier for us to get remedies that apply across all states, and so many of the bad acts in the mortgage industry----"
"Mr. Stupak","Well, have you reached out to the AGs?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Yes. We have reached out to the AGs, and we have also reached out to the attorney general. You may not have been here when I talked about this, but we are in the process of trying to resurrect something called the Executive Working Group which was very active in the 1990's, sort of stopped in the last 8 years, that involves Justice, the attorneys general, and the Federal Trade Commission having regular meetings to coordinate activities. That is going to be very, very helpful going forward."
"Mr. Stupak","You are right. I didn't hear that earlier testimony but I am glad to hear it and urge you to continue that progress. Thanks."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes himself for 2 minutes of additional questions. Chairman Leibowitz, if this Congress would enhance your authority, can the Commission set up a separate office to regulate and enforce consumer abuses and, if so, would this cover other substance of the FTC?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I would say this. As you know, Mr. Chairman, we are a small agency with a pretty large mission and we have to leverage our resources all the time, so if you give us that authority, and I think a majority of the Commission would be willing to embrace that authority and I think we could do good things for consumers, we will need more resources. I don't know that we need to grow to the level we were at in 1980, which was 1,800 FTEs, but I think to discharge--what you don't want us to do is to take people from spyware cases and other types of fraud cases and then simply move them to the newest, most problematic area and forget about all the other things we do. So I think we need more resources. I do know the appropriations committees are interested in giving us more resources and have given us small plus ups over the last couple of years because they like what we are doing, but we probably need additional resources on top of that."
"Mr. Rush","I have less than 1 minute, and I just want to ask another question on pay-day lending. I believe that pay-day lenders have a role in our economy but there are far too many abuses. Does the FTC have authority to crack down on pay-day lending practices such as rollover fees and the specific statutory language leading to direct the Commission to adequately deal with certain abusive pay-day lending features?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I would say yes and no. We have brought about a half dozen pay-day lending cases in the last 5 years. We don't have obviously--Congress set a cap, I believe, for pay-day loans outside of military bases at 36 percent a couple of years ago. We obviously don't have the authority to set a cap but one thing we found in our pay-day loan cases is the imbedded--is that malefactors have sort of imbedded fees that consumers don't know about, and so they will pay off their loan in 2 weeks but it will be a day late, and so then there will be a fee that pops up and then it is compounded and then they are sort of in a worse circle of debt. So we have the authority to do that. I think if you gave us the authority to go--if you gave us the authority to do rulemakings, we would look at ways to promulgate rules that would require better behavior by a lot of the pay-day lenders."
"Mr. Rush","The chair recognizes Mr. Radanovich for 2 minutes for additional questioning."
"Mr. Radanovich","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Leibowitz, you had mentioned that the commissioners decided not to initiate a rulemaking on deceptive Internet advertising, and the reason was because Congress would eventually act on the issue which you would have if you could proceed under the APA. And it sounds like, and we can have a discussion about this, that you are suggesting that the FTC APA rulemaking would obviate the need for legislative body at all. And adding to that question, I think I would ask isn't the Magnusson-Moss process intentionally deliberate similar to the congressional legislative process? I mean the founding fathers set this whole thing up so that legislating was difficult, and should your job be made easier or should you have to deliberate with us for a proper approach----"
"Mr. Leibowitz","All of us think our jobs should be made easier, but I don't mean to suggest that we would have obviated the need for congressional legislation if we had been able to do a rulemaking. And I don't mean to say that we wouldn't have stopped, you know, the economic mess that we all know we are in, but I do think we could have cleaned things up more quickly if we had APA rulemaking or something close to APA rulemaking, but again these were just discussions among commissioners because we knew that under APA--we knew that under Mag-Moss rulemaking it would be very, very hard to do a rule in a timely manner. And that is the problem with Mag-Moss rulemaking. I don't mean to say--I don't know if you were here when I was having a conversation with Mr. Stupak. There is a rationale for having us make rules more slowly, and certainly among folks who follow the FTC and have for years and decades there might have been some excesses perceived or real in the 1970's that led to some of the restrictions. For example, the restriction on unfairness that makes, as Mr. Pitts pointed out, makes it difficult for us to bring an unfairness case. But having said that, I think it is worth, and I know you are interested in just discussing this issue further about whether it makes sense to give us some relief from Mag-Moss. It doesn't necessarily mean it has to go all the way over to APA rulemaking, but I do think in some areas, you know, you want us to be able to act more nimbly, more agile and more quickly, maybe not in every area but in some. And when you pass new rules or new laws like Can-Spam, you have given us that APA rulemaking, and we have that APA rulemaking in the Omnibus for mortgages, for everything in the mortgage life cycle. So one thing is watch to see how we do in the mortgage with the rulemaking authority we have. If we do a balanced job, maybe it makes sense to give us just a little bit longer leash."
"Mr. Radanovich","Thank you."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Ohio for 2 minutes."
"Ms. Sutton","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You heard some discussion here about the state attorneys general, and in my opening statement I talked about some of the actions that we have taken in Ohio, but even after all that we have done, I am going to read to you the headline of a report from the Housing Research and Advocacy Center that is in Cleveland. The headline reads pay-day lenders operating in 81 Ohio counties charging up to 680 percent interest. Lenders avoiding the 28 percent APR cap passed by legislature and voters, and that is at the state level, in 1,020 stores statewide. And just to give you an idea of what is happening here despite legislation passed in 2008 aimed at lowering interest rates on short-term loans pay-day lenders are operating, as the headline reads, in 81 of Ohio's 88 counties making loans in some cases that carry that extraordinary annual percentage rate, 24 times more the rate that was approved by the legislature for such lending. And they have avoided the 28 percent cap by using other laws, so they are very crafty and they are very quick making the necessary adjustments to continue to reap what they reap. I guess my question just is what can you do to help or what can we do to help?"
"Mr. Leibowitz","Well, I mean there is no magic bullet for solving these problems, as I am sure you know. I was asking my staff about usury laws in different states yesterday as I was preparing for the hearing, and someone pointed out that in Missouri the cap is 2000 percent, so you borrow $100, you forget about it, the next year you owe $2,000. Look, one part is working with attorneys general because we have to leverage our limited resources, and that is a part of it. Another part is consumer education. We have a terrific consumer education group and that is a part of it. You know, I wish I could tell you there is a particular answer to this problem but it is-- there just isn't, and we all have to sort of pull--and, by the way, as more people are unemployed as the economy continues to spiral down, you are going to see more of these problems. You are going to see more people borrowing from pay-day lenders. Now Congress made the determination that outside of military bases pay-day lenders should be capped at, I think, 36 percent. I suppose Congress could make the determination that pay-day lenders should be capped at 36 percent and limited in fees, but that is a decision for you to make. I will say this. If you give us more authority to do rulemaking in this area, we will take a look at pay-day loans."
"Ms. Sutton","With the chair's indulgence, I appreciate that, and thank you for bringing up the issue about loans near military bases, and I would like to follow up with you about that as well because I understand that still problems remain, and I would like to talk about how we actually aggressively go after that."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentlelady, and the chair thanks the chairman again for the extensive use of his time. We know that you are quite busy and we certainly thank you for your enlightening commentary to this committee. We do intend to work with you on these and other matters as we proceed. And we just want to let you know that we appreciate your presence here."
"Mr. Leibowitz","Thank you."
"Mr. Rush","The chair now calls the second panel to the witness table. The chair wants to welcome this extraordinary panel before the committee, and we want to introduce you individually, and then we will ask that you all stand after your introduction so that we can swear you in. To my left, Mr. James Tierney. He is a Lecturer-in-Law at Columbia Law School, and he is the former attorney general of Maine. Welcome, Mr. Tierney. Next to Mr. Tierney is Mr. Christopher Peterson, Professor of Law at the S.J. Quinny College of Law. Welcome,"

QUINNY COLLEGE OF LAW; IRA RHEINGOLD, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF CONSUMER ADVOCATES; AND NATHAN BENSON, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TIDEWATER FINANCE COMPANY, INC., FOR THE AMERICAN FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSOCIATION"," "
"TESTIMONY OF JAMES TIERNEY"," "
"Mr. Tierney","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Jim Tierney. I am the Director of the National State Attorney General Program at Columbia Law School, and in that capacity I work closely with the men and women who serve as your attorneys general and your staff, all of whom are deeply committed to rooting out fraud in the area of credit. My testimony is obviously my own, but I have discuss it with a number of attorneys general, including your own, Mr. Chairman, Lisa Madigan, and I think I broadly reflect the views of those attorneys general who are committed to this important issue. I think if there is one thing that is clear is that we have insufficient consumer protection in the field of credit. That is the bottom line. We are not doing enough. The crisis is real and it is growing. And if there is one single lesson that has to be received in the halls of Congress and the halls of federal regulators, including the Federal Trade Commission, is that the states got it right and the states got it first. Speaking bluntly, until we have effective state regulation from state attorneys general and state banking commissioners, we will never get ourselves out of this hole. The question is how do we get from here to there, and that is a challenge. There is a long history of relationships between the federal and state approach to working with these issues. The federal government has a number of very narrow federal statutes enforced by not the Federal Trade Commission but enforced by banking regulatory agencies whose first job is to assure the safety and soundness of the banking community, and we see how well they have done that. But in addition to that, it is their responsibility allegedly to deal with consumer protection and they just don't do it. It is not their highest priority. It never will. On the state side you have broader laws, state unfair, deceptive and trade practices act, which are flexible, and state attorneys general get it right and get it first not because of--although they show great leadership and great courage they get it because they are structured to do it. They live in communities. Like you, they have constituents. They are able to move and move quickly, and they are able to move on a national basis and on a bipartisan basis so that they are able to achieve some very specific and concrete results. Now get to the hearing of the Federal Trade Commission. There is a long history between the Federal Trade Commission and the state attorneys general. Sometimes it is very positive. In the 1970s federal funding with the help of the Federal Trade Commission actually went to the states to get states more involved in consumer protection. Again, during the terms of the first President Bush and President Clinton, again we had warm and solid relationships with the Federal Trade Commission and the states were on the same side. The last 8 years have been very cold years. And I commend our new chairman. Our new chairman did the best he could to explain the facts as he found them, but the bottom line is that the Federal Trade Commission has been on the sidelines on a number of very, very important cases, and this is very unfortunate. Not only were they not involved in the cases but even informally they never called up an attorney general and said what did you learn? What are you seeing about the patterns of fraud? And this is a serious problem. I commend the chairman for reinstituting the Executive Working Group, which I called for in my formalized testimony. It is extraordinarily important. There are some regional directors of the FTC who work with the states, there are some who not. Certainly, the FTC are bringing cases but are these the biggest cases or is the FTC showing an instinct for the capillary. Are they striking at the major issues or are they grabbing onto low hanging fruit when they go after a case? We don't know. We don't know because people are not sitting down in the same work and discussing how do we put together a systematic, sophisticated process by which we can root out consumer fraud, and that requires a lot of work because there will never be enough lawyers in the Federal Trade Commission, never, never, never, to track down the kind of consumer fraud we are seeing. The FTC has to work with the states, state banking commissioners, the private bar, consumer advocacy groups, in other words, all the people that the states work with every day as they fashion the kind of priority prosecutions that are absolutely necessary to make this happen. Now not only have the states brought the cases that have been alluded to in the earlier testimony, the Household, the AmeriQuest, and the Countrywide, but they had to do it with one hand tied behind their back because they are litigating with the same federal agencies who are trying to pre-empt them from bringing these cases at all. That case is back before the United States Supreme Court again in April. It is a serious issue. The Banking Committee has held hearings on this. It is extraordinarily important that the Federal Trading Commission and the chair of the Federal Trade Commission stand up as has the chair of the FDIC, Sheila Bare, and said this is not a time to pre-empt states. We have a problem. We need more consumer protection, not less, and the timing is of extreme importance. So with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you for giving me this opportunity, and I look forward to answering any questions that you might have.  "

"TESTIMONY OF CHRISTOPHER PETERSON"," "
"Mr. Peterson","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, ranking member. It is an honor to be here today and share a few thoughts. I would like to start with two quick statistics, if I could, about the sub-prime and alternative mortgage product crisis. The first is roughly 6 million foreclosures coming through the pipe according to Credit Suisse, and then foreclosure rescue scam cases brought by the Federal Trade Commission, 6. According to their testimony in the Senate last month, they brought 6 foreclosure rescue scam cases for 6 million foreclosures. That is 1 in a million. Where I come from that is sort of a cliche you talk about when you said he is not doing anything, right? In my view, honorably, the Federal Trade Commission is a good agency that does their best but they are not doing anything. We are talking about taking teacups of water out of an ocean. It is just not even close to the sort of magnitude of problems that we are talking about. And so if I could just quickly, you talk about the rule of the law. We all have been talking about all these generalizations about separating good loans from bad loans. Just talk about the laws for a second. There is equal credit-- they have four titles of the Consumer Credit Protection Act, and then they have their deceptive trade practices authority. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act is designed to prevent discrimination in awarding credit. It doesn't do anything in the way of preventing bad loans from being made. The Fair Credit Reporting Act tries to clear up inaccurate credit information, but that is not the problem that we had here. Lots of people had prime credit histories and were still getting non-amortizing loans that have gone in waves into foreclosure. The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act is a nice gesture but it generally doesn't apply to home mortgage loan servicers and it comes too late. I mean at the point where the loan is already in default and there is debt collection problems, it is too late at that point. Then the Truth in Lending Act is a nice idea but it is too late. The disclosures are confusing. People generally just don't read them. They ignore the disclosures. And even if that was a great strategy the statute that is designed to promote honesty in origination of loans doesn't apply to mortgage brokers who are the people that actually talk to consumers. What sort of a truth in lending idea doesn't apply to the people who talk to the borrower? And then in addition to those four statutes, they also have two significant regulations that they have done under their deceptive trade practices authority. The holder in due course notice rule which doesn't apply to home mortgages, and that was back in 1975 and it has never been updated. And, second, the credit practices rule which bans about 5 different problematic contractual provisions including confessions of judgment and pyramiding late fees, but it hasn't been updated since 1984. And this regulation doesn't talk about any of the non- amortizing products and sub-prime products that we are talking about in the past few months. And that is it. I just did it. In 3 minutes I summed up their entire regulatory structure, and it really doesn't do much of anything to try and prevent home mortgage fraud. And what are the barriers that prevent more stuff from taking place? Well, it is true that they have this inefficient regulatory rulemaking process, and it seems to me it would be helpful to speed that up. But the real problem is the fragmented federal regulatory system. On my hand I can count 11 different agencies that are supposed to be dealing with this problem, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Office of the Comptroller, the Office of Thrift Supervision, FDIC, the National Credit Union Administration, the new Federal Housing Finance Administration, if I am getting that right, the new OFHEO, HUD, SEC, the FBI and Justice at the same time, and then finally the Federal Trade Commission. In this fragmented system, the capital flows to the weakest regulator like water going down into the basement. And the result is that there is very, very little actual rulemaking to try and deal with the problematic practices that are actually in our industry. So I have been coming up with a list of all the things that I think needs to get done, and I have this gigantic list of problems in our statutory system. It is a big list. We are talking a lot of changes that need to be made. Congress could do that but it is going to be a long and complicated bill. It is going to be very controversial. You could give it to a federal agency to try and do it but which one would you choose? The only plausible existing candidates are the Federal Reserve, which already have that authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act or the Federal Trade Commission, which is a good choice but has nowhere near the resources and has a too expansive mission. In my view, respectfully, it is time for a new regulatory agency that deals exclusively with this issue and has authority to pursue protection of consumers on consumer finance issues. And if you are not talking about that, if you are just talking about more tinkering then you are just kind of kidding yourself and you are not really going to fix anything.  "

"TESTIMONY OF IRA RHEINGOLD"," "
"Mr. Rheingold","Thank you, Chairman, and thank you, Ranking Member Radanovich. It really is quite a honor to testify before you, Congressman Rush. I started my career as a consumer advocate in Chicago where I began a legal assistance foundation foreclosure prevention project, and I worked through the mid- 90's dealing with all the mortgage crises that we had in Austin and Roslin, all over Chicago. And the things that we saw in Chicago in the 90's, we are seeing nationwide today. What I think disappoints me most about today's hearing is I am going to go through a litany of things that we consumer advocates saw in the 90's, saw in the early 2000's, and we see the exact same thing today. Nothing has changed except that things have gotten worse, and there has not been a federal response to it, including the FTC. I think about the world I see. I run an organization called the National Association of Consumer Advocates. We are the private attorneys, the legal service attorneys across this country who actually do the consumer advocacy work. We are on the ground every single day representing consumers who are losing their houses or having their car repossessed or being harassed by debt collectors. We see what is going on there but the federal regulatory agencies and the FTC have not talked to us. So what do we have out here? Oh, I should mention I also run a project called the Institute for Foreclosure Legal Assistance, so I am in contact and talk daily with all the private attorneys, the legal service attorneys in the community who are actually fighting foreclosures. We are on the ground. We know who the bad actors are. We see the bad practices, and we see what is going on out there. So what do we have? We have a completely broken mortgage lending industry. There is no question about it. Unfairness runs rampant. Bad lending practices are everywhere. We have a broken mortgage servicing system, completely broken. It is unaccountable. They can't figure out how much money people owe. They can't modify a loan to save their lives. We have seen, Chicago is a perfect example of it, a dual credit market. If you are middle income or rich, you have banks. If you are poor or you are low income, what do you have? You have currency exchanges and you have pay-day lenders, and you have rent to own, and you have refund anticipation loans. It is stealing wealth out of the communities that we care about most, and it has gone on unabated for the last decade with nobody really taking any real action and it is only getting worse. We have a debt collection industry that is completely out of control. We have growth of a debt buying industry that is sort of mind boggling in the way they go about collecting debts without actually even knowing--not having the contract that the person actually had that debt originally from. They don't have any proof that that is owed, yet they are using our nation's court and using our nation's private arbitration system to collect debts against people. We have a broken credit reporting system where consumers can't get real access to their credit reports. They don't get the information necessary and they can't fix those reports once they are broken. All of those things is what our credit market looks like today. And I went and talked with consumer advocates who I talk with every single day in this country. I asked them about the FTC and their role over the last 8 years and the last 10 years in protecting consumers. I will just pick some of the adjectives that I got responded, passive, antagonistic, irrelevant, disengaged, counterproductive, stuck in a world that doesn't regulate. They have not been part of the ballgame here. They can cite statistics. They can talk about some cases that they brought. In the scheme of things, it is mostly irrelevant. Now to be fair to them, they are under resourced, and there are good career attorneys there who do their best. But the fact is they have been disengaged. I have been in Washington now 7 years after I left Chicago, and some day I hope to return. And on one hand I can count the conversations I have had with the FTC. We are the people out there doing this kind of work. We are out there on--it really is sort of mind boggling to me that we sit here today with the problems that existed 10 years ago and we have had federal regulatory agencies who have done nothing except exacerbated the problem. The Federal Trade Commission, as Chris said, was using the spoon to clean out an ocean. They simply did not do the job. There is a number of things that can be done to improve them. Hopefully in the new Administration they will be more assertive and more aggressive. They have been completely passive in using their unfairness authority. They need to use it. They need to declare things--we know when things are unfair. When you give somebody a loan that they can't afford to pay back, that is unfair. It is not a really hard thing to figure out. They do need greater rulemaking authority. It is crazy. Six to 8 years to make a rule to protect consumers, that is just not the way it should work. Hopefully, they will have leadership, and I hope Chairman Leibowitz will demonstrate some leadership in terms of being assertive and aggressive in this area. They should have concurrent authority over the banks. There is a special place in regulatory hell for the federal bank regulators over the last 8 years and their complete failure to what has happened here. So hopefully the FTC can use of their consumer protection powers. I will stop there but be happy to answer any questions you might have about the FTC and the credit crisis we are facing.  "

"TESTIMONY OF NATHAN BENSON"," "
"Mr. Benson","Good morning, Chairman Rush, Ranking Member Radanovich, and members of the subcommittee. My name is Nathan Benson, and I am the CEO of Tidewater Finance Company, which was established in 1992 to purchase and service retail installment contracts. The company is based in Virginia Beach, Virginia, and has two lines of business, Tidewater Credit Services for consumer goods and Tidewater Motor Credit for auto services. I am here today in my capacity as a board director of American Financial Services Association, AFSA, whose 350 members include consumer and commercial finance companies, auto finance companies, card issuers, mortgage lenders, industrial banks and other firms that lend to consumers and small businesses. AFSA appreciates the opportunity to provide testimony to the members of the subcommittee. Today, I will focus my testimony on the role that the Federal Trade Commission has played, and continues to play, in helping to restore confidence in the financial services industry. I will also address the installment loan industry's importance in providing access to credit to millions of Americans. The FTC is the effective regulator. The FTC has been very successful in enhancing consumer protection under its current authority. It has addressed the economic crisis in two ways, first, by using its enforcement authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to pursue bad actors in the sub-prime mortgage industry, and, second, by setting federal policy through guidance and public comment. I will start by providing some examples that fall into the first category. The FTC successfully negotiated a $40 million settlement with Select Portfolio Services in November 2003 for engaging in unfair and deceptive practices in servicing sub-prime mortgage loans. The settlement was modified in August 2007 to provide additional protections to borrowers, including mandatory monthly mortgage statements, a 5-year prohibition on marketing optional products such as home warranties and refunds for foreclosure attorney fees for services that were not actually performed. The FTC has entered into a $65 million settlement with First Alliance Mortgage Company for making deceptive sub- prime mortgage loans. The FTC distributed the $65 million to nearly 20,000 affected borrowers. The FTC has successfully pursued other sub-prime mortgage lenders engaged in what the Commission deemed to be inappropriate conduct, including Capital City Mortgage Corporation and Quicken Loans. I want to just move on to the installment lending and its role in providing credit to consumers. At the outset, let me say that AFSA shares Congress' concern about predatory lending. We support the goal of protecting consumers from unfair, abusive, or deceptive lending and servicing practices while preserving access to responsible lenders. The installment lending industry was born in 1916 out of a need to provide credit to working men and women. The Russell Sage Foundation worked with lenders to develop a set of principles by which they would abide in their lending activities. Lenders agreed to make the cost of their loans transparent so that borrowers understood the true cost of the loan. Loans would be structured over a period of time allowing a repayment schedule that was long enough to match the earning power of the borrower. Finally, the lender would price the loan based on the character of the borrower, which was defined as a combination of the borrower's employment stability and previous history of handling credit. Today's installment lenders are a key element in improving the socio-economic status of poorer citizens and supporting our company's economic health. They do this by adhering to basic principle of economics, that people should borrow so they can consume based on their permanent income, and that such consumption is the fuel of our economy. Typically, the middle and upper class borrow through traditional banking and financial services relationships. However, average wage earners with few financial assets often cannot borrow in this way. Traditional banks simply are not equipped to offer products and services to these consumers in a manner that is profitable for the enterprise. As a result, these consumers need access to safe forms of small-sum credit. These are the very products the installment loan industry, an industry fully and completely regulated and examined at the state level, have been providing successfully for decades. Certainly, people turn to installment lenders for multiple reasons. Key among these, however, is the need to access small sums to deal with unforeseen circumstances. I could go on but if there are any questions.  "

"Mr. Rush","Thank you. I certainly want to thank the panel for their excellent testimony. The chair now recognizes himself for a round of questioning for 5 minutes. I want to address my first question to the entire panel, and each one of you can take a few seconds to answer the question as you will. Most of you have testified this morning that the FTC has not done enough to address consumer credit issues over the past years, particularly over the last 8 years. And let me just ask each one of you, do you believe that this has occurred because of a lack of action, political or structure in nature? In other words, do you believe the Commission has failed to act because of a lack of will or because of some underlying obstacles such as the lack of statutory authority, the lack of resources, burdensome procedures, or all of the above? If you could explain to me in your answer why you believe the FTC has failed to act. Mr. Tierney."
"Mr. Tierney","Well, we can go in the same order, Congressman. I think it is clear that the leadership of the Federal Trade Commission at the very highest level in the last 8 years, very highest level, shared the de-regulatory philosophy that was predominant at the time, and the philosophy was clearly stated to state attorneys general on a regular basis that you were vicious intermeddlers, you were denying credit to people who need it, you are applying the wrong standards, that we should let the marketplace prevail and it will be a self-regulatory procedure. And although time and again attorneys general would expressly predict, it turned out conservatively, a million home foreclosures they were characterized as alarmists, not necessarily by the Federal Trade Commission but by the tone of the times and by the interest groups that surrounded the Commission, so the Commission at the top reflected the reality. I would also make another smaller point that our past two presidents have persisted in naming people to the Commission with an anti-trust background, not a consumer protection background, and that is a bipartisan characterization of our past three presidents actually. And that it would be a really good idea if the Federal Trade Commission had someone on the Commission who had a consumer protection background, and, secondly, actually had worked with the states and did not come from a large law firm or from the Hill. And I don't mean the personal characterization, but I really do believe that the FTC is lacking that kind of background and experience at the very highest level."
"Mr. Rush","Does the other panel want to weigh in on this?"
"Mr. Peterson","I do. I would like to say that in the past 12 years it has been primarily a political or lack of willpower issue, but going forward it is more likely to have something to do with the structural issues. I think that there are structural problems but even if 12 years ago we had cleared out all those structural problems they still wouldn't have done anything. Going forward, I think they are going to try and do some things now, and it is going to be harder for them to do it than it should be because of the structural barriers and it would probably help if we cleared some of those out. But even still, I think we are still talking about tinkering with things. We are not talking about the magnitude change that needs to happen in order to help facilitate more efficient and effective commerce."
"Mr. Rheingold","I would concur with my fellow panelists, I think a lot of it was ideological. I think there was this notion that self regulation would work and the FTC should not interfere in the commerce of credit, so I think that is part of it without a doubt. And in part that is why a lot of consumer advocates did not engage with the FTC and the AGs didn't engage with the FTCs because we fear that the work we did would actually be undercut by their philosophy. I do think that resources are a significant problem there. They have an awful lot of jurisdiction. They have very limited resources. They have very little rulemaking, and I also agree that if they had that authority over the last decade nothing would have changed, but I think going forward we have some opportunity to do something."
"Mr. Rush","Mr. Benson, I have 30 seconds so please."
"Mr. Benson","Yes. We felt that through those cases that they have done anything about, that has affected over 10,000 people, and when they pick on an entity in an industry that has helped everyone that is tied to that industry, so it is not just that entity that is being affected. It is everyone in that environment that gets cleaned up pretty quick, so we think they have been pretty effective. When they pick on one entity it goes through to the whole industry doing the same things, so we think so far they have been effective."
"Mr. Rush","Thank you very much. The chair now recognizes the ranking member, Mr. Radanovich, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Radanovich","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Benson, welcome to the subcommittee. I appreciate your testimony. I want to start off with you on a couple of questions. Do you believe the FTC needs APA procedures in order to be effective or can it use the existing authority that it has to effectively regulate the industry?"
"Mr. Benson","We believe that it can use its existing authority that it has."
"Mr. Radanovich","Let me ask you, how can regulation be used to reduce fraud without adding unnecessary compliance costs that are inevitably passed on to the consumer?"
"Mr. Benson","Well, most of our members through AFSA are state regulated so we are controlled by them. We are in favor of disclosure with all our members, so we work with those people so we believe with full disclosure and with obviously the regulations with the state, we believe that fraud will come out as long as it is monitored."
"Mr. Radanovich","I was looking at the new sample disclosure form by the FTC, which I thought was kind of interesting. Can you tell me your opinion of it? It seems it is easy to read. Have you seen it?"
"Mr. Benson","No, we haven't seen it."
"Mr. Radanovich","OK. OK. My first glance at is it is something that looks kind of positive. I was curious to know what your thoughts would be on it."
"Mr. Benson","As I said earlier, our view is more disclosure and the simpler it gets, a lot better it is."
"Mr. Radanovich","OK. One last question. The FTC has proposed disclosure simplification forms for mortgage--I think you have already answered that one. Thank you, Mr. Benson. I appreciate that. Mr. Rheingold, can I ask you, you testified that the FTC--that had the FTC had the will to actively engage in oversight much of the current credit crisis could have been avoided. We are talking about increasing authority through the APA and we are discussing that additional authority. Isn't that kind of a duplicative entry statement?"
"Mr. Rheingold","I don't think so. I actually think there are two things happening here, and I think to be fair the FTC was not the controlling regulatory agency. The OCC and the OTS really failed and they had a lot of things that they could have done to prevent the disaster we have today. I think the OCC through its enforcement powers, if they in fact had been effective enforcers and using those decisions, I think the perfect example of a strong enforcement agency can do is what the Massachusetts AG did in the Freemon case where they brought a case against the mortgage company who was engaged in unfair practices, where they were making loans that people could not afford, and using the unfairness authority that court declared that these practices, A, B, C, and D, making a loan at a teaser rate that explodes and people can't afford it is unfair. Making a loan to people over 50 percent of their gross income is per se unfair. If the FTC would have taken some of those actions, even in the Fairbanks case there was an opportunity to declare certain practices that the service industry does as unfair, it could have had a real impact on the type of practices that exist throughout the mortgage industry."
"Mr. Radanovich","Using that example, where was the problem then? Was it in the lack--was it in the application of Magnusson-Moss or was it----"
"Mr. Rheingold","Well, I am talking about their enforcement power. There is a difference between rulemaking--there are a couple of ways that they can set the law. By bringing in--if the FTC brings an action and gets a court order that declares as part of their court-agreed order that this practice is unfair, that will have a pretty large impact in terms of the rest of the industry because it will send a clear signal that this is an unfair practice and hopefully would stop it. That is one way they could do it, through their court enforcement procedures. I think the easier thing they could have done if they, in fact, had normal every day authority to make rulemaking is they could have done that without having to bring court cases. And the fact is, as someone who has been a veteran of dealing with a lot of the rulemaking that is done through all sorts of regulatory agencies, industry and consumer groups have ample opportunity through the APA procedure to get their voices heard and influence that process. And the notion that they need 6 to 8 years with this lengthy, excuse me, cockamamie system of developing a way of rulemaking really it is counterproductive and useless, and anything that they could do with the current system that we have in place if it takes 6 to 8 years by the time you get a decision the problems out there would have evolved to something completely different."
"Mr. Radanovich","All right. Thank you very much, Mr. Rheingold. I yield back, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the gentleman. The chair now recognizes the gentlelady from Ohio, Ms. Sutton, for 5 minutes."
"Ms. Sutton","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have heard repeatedly here today about some of the shortcomings of what we are trying to accomplish in the process that now exists. A couple of those, of course, revolve around the fact that the FTC, we hear over and over again, doesn't have the authority over banks that it has over other entities, and we also hear about the rulemaking process being too cumbersome, but I guess one of the questions for this committee and for the Congress and for all of us here is if the FTC had rulemaking authority that was more streamlined, APA rulemaking authority, and they had greater authority over the banks, and they had resources to do the job, is it better for the FTC to be the agency that deals with this or some of you have suggested there should be a new entity to do so. If you could just answer those questions for me, I would appreciate your opinion."
"Mr. Tierney","I guess I would say, Congresswoman, I, like many of us, was studying the proposal by Professor Warren. It has been called the so-called Durbin-Delahunt bill. I have not taken a position on it yet but it has a lot to it. But, if I may, to go back to your earlier point about pay-day lending, and remember the name of the song, If You Can't Be With the One You Love, Love the One You're With, we have enough authority now between the states and the trial lawyers and the legislatures and the Federal Trade Commission. If we just want to do something and focus on the problem such as pay-day, take the resources we have, set a national strategic goal, and just go do it. And my concern about discussion of the larger institution is that while we play that huge congressional effort that goes on for so long, that we have millions of people suffering every day, and we should do something right now."
"Mr. Benson","I believe that the way you regulate it, and I am the only, I think, business person here, is you got to have some skin in the game, you got to have some money in the game, so if you are going to securitize you got to have--someone has got to hold a portion of the securitization on the books. If you are going to have loans out there, you got to have the risk factor, that you shouldn't be able to go and draw on someone's back account. You should be able to analyze the person's credit, make the loan that they can afford over time, payments over time, equal payments. That would solve the problem rather than the risk factor. When you have got nothing at risk, the issues come out."
"Mr. Peterson","If I could, I think that a new agency is the way to go. That is my honest opinion. The second choice would be the Federal Trade Commission. I don't think you should give it to the Federal Reserve Board. They have demonstrated that they are bankers at their heart and soul, and they have the authority to pass--they have extensive authority under the 1994 Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act. You passed that statute and gave them all the power that they needed and they did nothing. The Federal Reserve Board could have stopped this easily with their rulemaking authority under HOEPA, and they didn't do anything, so what is to think that that is going to change now? And what is more with the Federal Reserve Board, they have so much political autonomy. It is so hard to exercise oversight over them because of their justified and needed monetary policy independence. I just don't think that it is a good political entity that is going to be at the beck and call of Congress and will be responsive to the people. It is time for a new consumer finance regulator that deals with these types of questions, and if you can't get that passed the Federal Trade Commission is the next best choice. But the problem is that the FTC has a lot of other important stuff to do. It needs to be out there on the anti-trust watchdog beat. It needs to be dealing with privacy issues, telemarketing issues, all very important issues, and very different than the consumer finance problems that we are talking about now. If this is ever going to happen, it is now, and if you don't do it now it will never happen, and we will continue to suffer from these systemic problems for the next 50 to 100 years."
"Mr. Rheingold","I agree."
"Ms. Sutton","Is that an I agree, Mr. Rheingold?"
"Mr. Rheingold","I absolutely agree."
"Ms. Sutton","OK. Thank you, and I yield back."
"Mr. Rush","The chair thanks the witnesses. We don't intend to go into a second round of questioning. I think that we have been well served by both panels today, and the chair really again--we are most grateful to this panel for the extensive use of your time. And we want to commend you on your patience with us through this particular issue. I just want to note that all witnesses should be prepared to receive and answer written questions from members of this subcommittee. And with that, thank you very much."
"Mr. Benson","Could I ask that my complete statement be included in the record?"
"Mr. Rush","So ordered. And I would like to request unanimous consent to enter into the record a statement from the organization, Public Citizen. Without objection, so ordered. "
"Mr. Rush","This subcommittee now stands adjourned.   "
