"Mr. Graves","Thank you, Madam Chair. I want to thank you for holding this important hearing on the ability of small businesses to obtain needed capital. Given the recent job numbers, the country will be relying on small businesses to help the American economy grow. Although Shakespeare warned the people that the people should neither be a lender nor a borrower, he was unfamiliar with the modern American economy. Today the car-boat dealer needs financing to purchase inventory to resell. The home or commercial builder needs funds to buy land in the face of mortgage backed security debacles. The manufacturer needs funds for investing in the latest equipment to make it competitive in the global economy. Capital then is the life blood of the American economy. There is no doubt that the current environment for raising capital is difficult even for the largest businesses with the AAA credit ratings when they have to compete against the voracious appetite of the most credit worthy borrower in the world, the United States government. So I can imagine how difficult it is for small businesses to find capital. Since the end of the Korean conflict, the federal government has recognized that small businesses have a much harder time raising capital than their large business competitors. Programs overseen by the SBA provide small businesses with access to debt and equity financing. These programs have a number of restrictions and limitations that may reduce their utilization among small businesses. In times of economic necessity, imposing unnecessary barriers to existing programs for providing capital seems counterintuitive. As a result, I am interested in hearing the opinions of our witnesses on the value of the SBA programs and what changes are needed to insure that America's small businesses can obtain the needed infusions of capital to keep the economy alive. And, again, Madam Chair, I appreciate you having this hearing, and thank you to our witnesses for all coming a long way in many cases for being here. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. And I welcome our first witness, Ms. Cynthia Blankenship. She is the Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer of Bank of the West in Grapevine, Texas. Bank of the West was founded in 1985 and specializes in customer service and small business financing. She is testifying on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. The ICBA represents more than 20,000 locations nationwide. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF CYNTHIA BLANKENSHIP",""
"Ms. Blankenship","Thank you, Chairman Velazquez and Ranking Member Graves. I appreciate the opportunity to be here today and present the views of the nation's community banks on both capital markets and small business lending. In addition to small business lending, Bank of the West has been a long time partner with the Small Business Administration and is strongly committed to helping our communities, using the SBA's 7(a) program and the 504 loan program. Bank of the West has more than $10 million in SBA loans in its portfolio, and we service these loans. This represents six percent of our total loans. Notably, as of May, our total small business lending and SBA lending are running ahead of the amount last year in 2008. So we are doing our part and working hard to get capital out there to the deserving small businesses. My bank's SBA loans create hundreds of jobs by financing the local preschool, health center, hardware store, and auto dealer. Community banks represent the other side of the financial story. Community banks like Bank of the West experienced difficult economic times before, and like always, we stick with our communities and our small business customers. As Chairman of the ICBA, I was recently honored to participate with President Obama and Treasury Secretary Geithner, as well as Chairman Velazquez and Ranking Member Graves, in advancing important policy initiatives to small business lending. ICBA strongly supports the recent initiatives to bolster small business loan program included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. SBA lending program must serve as a counterbalance during these challenge credit markets for small businesses. Unfortunately, at a time when the economy is faltering, the sharp 2009 decline in the number of SBA loans is troubling. The recent uptick in SBA loans is a positive and welcome sign, but we still have a very long way to go before it reaches solid levels again. Community banks are well positioned and willing to help get our economy back on track. While community banks represent 12 percent of all bank assets, they make 20 percent of all business loans and more than half of all business loans under $100,000. Some 48 percent of small businesses get their financing from banks with one billion dollars and less in assets. Therefore, we encourage policy makers to be mindful and supportive of the community banking sector's important role in supplying credit to small business. To that end, ICBA supports strong SBA programs, fair regulatory treatment and tax policies that will foster robust community bank small business lending. Specifically, ICBA appreciates your work, Chairman Velazquez, and the work of the Committee in enacting $730 million in ICBA-backed SBA-related funding in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. This included reduced fees for borrowers and lenders and increased guaranty levels, a new deferred payment program, and a secondary market initiative. Given the prolonged length and depth of the recession, the credit crunch, ICBA encourages Congress to extend or make permanent the SBA fee reductions beyond 2009. We urge SBA to follow the statute and Congress' intent to give priority to small banks in implementing the 7(a) lender fee reduction. ICBA is encouraged to see the SBA finishing the implementation of the ARC loan program. This program will allow existing small business bank customers to better service their debt and ride out the economic slowdown. The SBA market must be restored. I know first hand that my bank would be able to make more small business loans if I was able to sell my existing inventory into the secondary market. ICBA offers several additional policy recommendations aimed at returning more community banks to SBA lending. These include insuring SBA makes good on their loan guarantees and provides more flexibility in small business size standards and market- based loan pricing. ICBA also believes the bank regulatory pendulum has swung too far and is crushing many community banks' ability to lend to small businesses. In conclusion, the need for affordable small business capital is greater than ever. Community bankers run small businesses themselves, live and work in the communities with their small business customers, and we will do everything we can to insure that we meet the credit needs of our local community. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Our next witness is Ms. Jean Wojtowicz. She is the chair of the Board of Directors of the National Association of Development Companies. She is also founder of Cambridge Capital Management Corporation, a manager of nontraditional sources of capital for businesses in Indianapolis, Indiana. The National Association of Development Companies provides legislative and regulatory support for its members. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF JEAN WOJTOWICZ",""
"Ms. Wojtowicz","Thank you. I am so pleased to be here, and I would like to thank the entire Committee for their continued support of the CDC industry and the 504 loan program. First I would like to discuss the need to reduce the cost of this program. SBA has informed us that its 2010 budget increases the cost of 504 loans by 38.9 basis points per annum, and this is due to at least two factors in the SBA's econometric subsidy model: the national unemployment rate and the forecast of the 504 default rate. With both of these factors being impacted by the current recession and their real effect expected to be shortlived, we ask the Committee to consider requesting an appropriation sufficient to offset this fee increase for the next two years as small businesses return to a growth mode and improve their cash flow. This request needs immediate attention in order to negate the impact of this fee increase on our borrowers for fiscal 2010. It is inconsistent in this economy to offer small businesses fee relief through the stimulus bill in February of 2009 and turn around and increase their cost of borrowing in October of that same year. Second, we need to reach out to more small businesses. Our industry thanks the Small Business Committees for their leadership role in adding key programs to the stimulus bill earlier this year that are beginning to impact capital access and job creation. However, we believe that more should be done quickly to have added impact. Even as SBA works to implement new programs and fee reductions created in the stimulus bill, the loan eligibility and underwriting criteria to maximize the effectiveness of these programs are drifting toward more conservative and restrictive interpretations. For example, SBA has moved to restrict borrowers from accessing their personal home equity in order to inject these funds into 504 expansion projects. NADCO has prevailed upon the agency to reconsider this policy while they collect additional data. We are hopeful that when SBA completes this analysis they will again allow business owners to inject capital in any way possible. We believe that many small businesses either need access to larger loan amounts or have already reached their maximum availability under current law. This can be addressed in three ways. First, increase the maximum 504 debenture beyond its current limit of $1.5 million. Second, allow a borrower to maximize use of both 504 and 7(a) loan limits. And, third, eliminate the regulation that restricts business owners with higher net work and liquidity from accessing these loans. Next I would like to emphasize the need to reduce loan losses with more effort devoted to loan liquidation and recoveries. At Congress' direction several years ago, SBA created a new regulation that enabled it to take advantage of the recovery expertise within the CDC industry. Many CDCs already performed such tasks for other loan programs that they administer. They have simply not been given the ability and the freedom by SBA to do this on a broad scale for their 504 loans. NADCO believes that losses can be reduced if CDCs are actively engaged in the loan recovery process. This will require cooperation with rather than dictation from SBA liquidation staff. Further, NADCO proposes that SBA use its loan servicing contractor to speed up collection and payments for defaulted loans and we ask that this accounting information be made available to CDCs to assist them in their recovery efforts. Can you imagine trying to collect a loan without being able to tell the borrower what the balance is or in today's electronic age not being able to have a borrower wire a payment or send an ACH payment on a defaulted loan? The SBA loan programs are over 20 years old, and an environment of restrictive and overbearing regulations has evolved within the agency. With this new administration and fresh thinking from senior policy makers, NADCO sees an opportunity to break out of the old program structure and bureaucracy. We see the chance to work with this new leadership team and with the new Congress to expand program benefits to more borrowers. Like any maturing organization, SBA has to reevaluate its products to serve the changing needs of small businesses. NADCO urges Congress to collaborate with the new SBA management and with far sighted, market driven lenders to create the financing and economic development programs so vital to America's future. Nimble and forward thinking small businesses will lead us out of this recession. Let's help them do it sooner. Working together, we can get America working. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. And I welcome now Mr. Roger Heacock. He is the president and CEO of the Black Hill Federal Credit Union in Rapid City, South Dakota. The Black Hill Federal Credit Union has over 49,000 members with assets of more than $765 million. Mr. Heacock is here to testify on behalf of the Credit Union National Association, the national trade association serving America's credit unions. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF ROGER HEACOCK",""
"Mr. Heacock","Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the Committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Credit Union National Association. I am honored to address the impact SBA lending has on our local economy, our credit union, and our members, and to suggest ways to improve SBA programs. Black Hills was first authorized to do SBA lending in January 2003, and we truly value our partnership with the SBA. We wrote more SBA loans than any other financial institution in South Dakota during 2008, 29 loans for a total of $1.6 million. We are looking forward to working with new SBA Administrator Karen Hills and find working with the SBA beneficial to the credit union and our members for several reasons. We have a number of members who started small businesses using SBA loan funds while continuing to work at their primary job as their main source of income. The SBA helped us be there for our members, and this has resulted in additional employment opportunities. There is additional risk to these types of borrowers, and quite frankly, other lenders shy away from helping them because there is not a proven cash flow. We are able to do this type of lending because of the guarantee that SBA provides. The programs allow us to help the borrower who comes in and may not have the equity investment we would generally like to see but has a good business plan. The SBA helps us create an acceptable level of risk, and it is a win-win situation for all of us, the credit union, the SBA, and the borrower. CUNA is a strong supporter of the 7(a) and 504 loan programs, essential tools for achieving our mission to serve the needs of members. However, several important factors discourage more credit unions from participating as SBA lenders. First, the statutory cap on credit union MBLs restricts the ability of credit unions from helping their members even more. Even though the cap does not apply to SBA loans, it is a real barrier, keeping some credit unions from establishing an MBL program at all. Not all loans fit SBA parameters, and credit unions are reluctant to initiate an MBL program when they may reach the cap in a fairly short order. CUNA is also aware that some lenders have not had a positive experience with the SBA, citing the application process, fees, and time of decision making. In that vein, we think there are ways to improve the work that is done by the SBA. As the Committee reviews SBA programs, we encourage Congress to make additional funds available to the agency so that fees can remain low and the guarantees can remain sufficient. We appreciate Congress setting aside $375 million for the temporary elimination of fees and raising the guaranty percentage on some loans to 90 percent as part of the Recovery Act. In closing, credit union business lending represents just over one percent of the depository institution business lending market. Credit unions have about $33 billion in outstanding business loans compared to $3.1 trillion for banking institutions. We are not financing skyscrapers or sports arenas. We are making loans to members who own and operate small businesses. Despite the financial crisis, the chief obstacle for credit union business lending is not the availability of capital. Credit unions are, in general, well capitalized. Rather, the chief obstacle is the statutory limits imposed by Congress in 1998. Under current law, credit unions are restricted from member business lending in excess of 12.25 percent of their total assets. This arbitrary cap has no basis in either actual credit union business lending or safety and soundness considerations. And the U.S. Treasury Department found that delinquencies and charge-offs for credit union business loans were much lower than that for either banks or thrifts. The cap effectively limits entry into the business lending arena on the part of small and medium size credit unions, the vast majority of all credit unions, because the costs and requirements, including the need to hire and retain staff with business lending experience exceed resources of many credit unions. While we support strong regulatory oversight of member business lending, there is no safety and soundness rationale for the cap. There is, however, a significant economic reason to eliminate the cap. America's small business needs access to capital. We estimate that if the cap on credit union business lending were removed, credit unions could safely and soundly provide as much as $10 billion for new loans for small businesses within the first year. This is an economic stimulus that would not cost the taxpayers a dime or increase the size of government. Madam Chairwoman, thank you very much for convening this hearing and inviting me to testify. I look forward to answering the Committee's questions. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Heacock. Our next witness is Ms. Hollis Huels. Ms. Huels is the Senior Vice President of Capital for Business in St. Louis, Missouri. Capital for Business is a national private investment firm focused on providing capital to middle market businesses. Ms. Huels is testifying on behalf of the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies, the oldest organization of venture capitalists in the world. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF HOLLIS A. HUELS",""
"Ms. Huels","Madam Chair, Ranking Member, members of the Committee, thank you so much for the opportunity to appear today and offer the National Association of Small Business Investment Companies' views on expanding small business access to capital. I am a Senior Vice President and a partner with Capital for Business. We are a private equity fund headquartered in St. Louis, Missouri, and have been an active investor through the SBIC program for almost 50 years. I am also chair of our Board of Governors of NASBIC. We appreciate the Committee's continued commitment to small business. We particularly appreciate the SBIC reforms that were included in the Recovery Act. Your actions have helped many of our small business partners. SBICs are private equity funds that invest exclusively in domestic small businesses. While the bigger names in private equity and venture capital invest globally, SBICs invest locally in Main Street businesses. Many of SBA's greatest success stories, Federal Express, Intel, Outback Steakhouse, Whole Foods, Apple, Quiznos, and many, many more received their early funding through the SBIC program. SBICs should be part of your approach to end the recession, grow the economy and create jobs. The SBIC program has been a successful, market-driven, collaboration providing over $55 billion of financing to over 106,000 U.S. businesses. While these are large numbers, the program is currently underutilized. The program's design is simple and effective. Debenture SBIC fund managers raise private capital for investment in small business and are able to enhance these investment by borrowing periodically from the SBA. Currently, the SBIC debenture program has capacity to facilitate investments of about $4 billion a year in America's small business. However, currently only $1.5 billion are being utilized. Over the next four years, this is an opportunity cost of approximately $10 billion. SBICs are needed now. Small business investment is in tight supply, but demand is strong. It is in times of economic stress that small business can be nimble and take advantage of growth opportunities, but they need access to capital. We recently polled our NASBIC members found that 100 percent of the respondents reported that banks are pulling or reducing their senior lines of credit available. Seventy-five percent of the respondents reported less subordinated debt available for small business. One of the most respected publications in the lower middle market, GF Data Resources, recently reported that ``we are now in the throes of a dramatic slowdown in non-distressed private equity sponsored buy-out activity.'' While this year SBICs have invested in over 1,000 companies with an average investment of just over a million dollars, the impact of SBICs is hindered by the relatively low number of licensees. Imagine what could be done if the program were running anywhere near full capacity. For seed and early stage companies the situation is even worse. Early stage and equity investing for small business has largely dried up. A recent survey by the National Association of Seed and Venture Funds found that 90 percent of early stage entrepreneurial companies, some of the nation's best job creators, are having serious difficulty raising follow-on capital. The SBA previously had an effective tool that was exceptionally successful at using the private market to steer equity investments into domestic small business with taxpayer money as an enhancement. While it lasted, this program invested over $13 billion and over 385,000 new jobs were created and hundreds of thousands of more were saved. While almost 70 percent of venture capital goes to high tech and life science industries, this program invested in small business manufacturing. Unfortunately for America's small business, the demand for the SBIC capital is increasing at a time when the SBIC program is at its nadir. Last year, only six SBIC funds were licensed. This is down over 90 percent from the peak. Licensing from the 1990s only took a few months, and in contrast, last year many SBICs had to wait well over a year. The good news is that for Fiscal Year 2009, the SBA has already licensed nine SBICs, an increase of over 50 percent from the prior year. The SBA is openly trying to get licensing waiting periods down to four months. This is a great start, but we would be in a better place if 30 or 40 new funds were licensed each year. There is evidence of a dramatic uptick in the number of fund managers interested in becoming SBICs. The program should welcome more funds and investors and thereby providing a market-based solution to the current capital crunch. My written testimony details and explains the areas of improvement and reform, but I will briefly describe them. First, increase the number of SBICs. Keep the successful funds in the program. We need more SBICs in more places, particularly the West. Insure that the SBICs that can raise private capital are not placed at a disadvantage and implement the energy debenture. We also need to provide incentives for banks and others to invest in SBICs and create a stable equity option for early stage investment. In conclusion, the Recovery Act it was projected to save or create four million jobs cost nearly 197,000 per job. The small business jobs can be created for far less, close to 11 to $33,000 per job. If we take advantage of the SBIC program we can have a real impact on small business. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Our next witness is Mr. Michael McGannon. He is the Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of Country Club Bank in Kansas City, Missouri. Country Club Bank was founded in 1953 and is based in Shawnee Mission, Kansas. Mr. McGannon is testifying on behalf of the American Bankers Association, found in 1975. The ABA brings together banks of all sizes and charters into one association. Welcome. STATEMENT OF MICHAEL McGANNON"
"Mr. McGannon","Thank you, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves and members of the Committee. My name is Michael McGannon, Senior Vice President and Chief Lending Officer of Country Club Bank in Kansas City, Missouri. Country Club Bank is a family owned community bank with over $650 million in assets. The focus of this Committee is extremely important. Consistently, small businesses are drivers of new ideas, new employment, and new economic growth. For banks like mine, small businesses are our bread and butter. While some might think the banking industry is composed of only large global banks, the vast majority of banks in our country are community banks, small businesses in their own right. In fact, over 3,400 banks, 41 percent, have fewer than 30 employees. The topic of SBA lending for small businesses is especially important and timely. The efforts that have been made by this Committee, the Congress as a whole, and the administration to improve the environment and opportunities for small businesses through changes to the SBA program have been needed for many years. These changes are particularly important in the difficult economic conditions which are affecting all businesses, including banks. The SBA program has struggled over the last several years. SBA Fiscal Year 2008 loan volume figures showed a 30 percent decline year over year in the 7(a) loan guaranty program, and Fiscal Year 2009 figures would indicate a similar reduction in volume. The economy is certainly playing a significant role in overall loan volume decline. However, many lenders are concerned that this decline is also due to SBA programs becoming too costly and difficult for lenders and small businesses who wish to access the program. For this reason we recommend the following changes to the SBA program. First, SBA should work with trade associations like ABA to formulate SBA programs that are attractive to lenders of all sizes, and especially to community bankers. Most small community banks are intimidated by the amount of paperwork required for a regular SBA 7(a) loan. In the past the SBA had a product in which there was a two-page application for the bank to complete and had an 80 percent guarantee. This program has been eliminated. Furthermore, the SBA needs to eliminate the financial and human resource burden on community banks created by SBA audits, particularly a concern with several new programs coming on line this year. These audits review loans already on the books that are already being scrutinized by other federal regulators, such as the FDIC or the OCC. Worse, banks are required to pay for their own SBA audit even though it does nothing to correct or stabilize a loan or to assist if there is the need for a liquidation. Second, SBA should reduce the time it takes for participating banks to collect on loan guarantees. In our own experience, we have been fortunate to collect on all guarantees submitted. However, the time frame for these collections is sporadic. There is a near universal agreement in the lending community that efforts to collect on the loan guarantee from SBA can be a time consuming and costly process. Third, community banks need personal contacts with knowledgeable people who can answer our questions. Our bank has had the benefit of a very cooperative SBA office in Kansas City. This relationship has been vital in making sure we stay on track with new changes in SBA regulations. However, banks in outlying areas do not have the benefit of a local SBA office that understands them, their clients or their town. Instead, they have to contact someone at a 1-800 number and get answers to questions. As a community banker from Missouri, I take pride in knowing the business and the community that an entrepreneur is trying to serve. It is critical that SBA returns to a model of helping local small businesses and banks through off-site training programs that can tend to the needs of the lending partnership. Thank you for your time and attention today. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. McGannon. Ms. Blankenship, I would like to address my first question to you, if I may. You mentioned a problem and Mr. McGannon also mentioned the same problem with the SBA either denying or delaying payment on guarantees. Can you talk to us about how serious this problem is, and if so, how does it affect the program's overall success?"
"Ms. Blankenship","Well, in my own experience at our bank, we have not been denied any of the guarantees when we have had to go back to SBA. However, I have heard through the association that there are banks. There is a grumbling that there are many delays and maybe they are just getting a little pickier on the paperwork and the appraisals. And what that does is just foster an air of distrust with using that program. If a bank can be able to rely on that guaranty, then they feel very comfortable in using that program and it works to their benefit. But if they do not know that the government will stand behind the guaranty, then it will affect the program."
"Mr. McGannon","The SOP manual from the SBA is over 400 pages long, and I think that if you are not a banker that is in the routine of making SBA loans, you get lost on dotting all of the Is and crossing all of the Ts. My sense is that, and once again, we have never had a problem collecting on a guaranty. Sometimes it takes longer than we would like, but we have been paid in full. I think the concern with bankers that are not in the routine of making SBA loans would find that trying to follow the SOB, trying to be sure that disbursements are appropriate at the front end, I think a lot of bankers may have trouble documenting or remembering to document the use of proceeds on the front end of an SBA loan, and when it comes time to collect on a defaulted loan, they may not have the paperwork in place to step through the disbursement process on the front end. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Ms. Huels, one of the short comings of Government Investment Program is the emphasis placed on early results. Consequently, there is a tendency to prematurely terminate programs that do not achieve results immediately. In the case of patient equity investment, how long does it take for investment programs to bear fruit?"
"Ms. Huels","That is a great question. When equity capital is invested into a company, there is an immediate impact as far as the ability to hire employees, which will reduce the unemployment rate or increase the employment. So those dollars and the resulting payroll taxes and things, you will see an immediate impact. In the midterm, you see an impact. The company that receives equity capital is obviously buying goods and services from other companies so that capital is spent through the economy by buying goods and services. I think what you are referring to is when do you see return on your equity capital, and most private equity funds have a ten-year life. They spend the first three to five years investing the capital. Then the companies need time to mature and to grow, and then those investments are typically harvested in a seven to ten-year time frame. It is patient capital. It takes quite a while. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. Thank you. Ms. Wojtowicz, we are all aware that the current recession grew out of the collapse in real estate prices, and this has significant consequences for the 504 program, which is often used to finance real estate. Do you believe that the SBA and the CDC community have the tools to mitigate potential fallout from these conditions?"
"Ms. Wojtowicz","I certainly do. I actually think that the depression in the real estate prices will create some opportunities. We have certainly seen an uptick in our backlog of new transactions where borrowers who have previously been leasing facilities are now seeing clear and finding some bargains actually in the commercial real estate market. As it relates to our existing portfolio, I think we have to be very cautious. We do have to find a way to be patient. This is not the time to be trying to liquidate or to force liquidation of real estate holdings if there is any changed of rehabilitating a borrower. Forcing a borrower, walking through a foreclosure and trying to sell commercial real estate in this market will only increase the losses to the program and the taxpayer. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Ms. Blankenship, today, and you were in the White House participating with President Barack Obama when he made that announcement for the use of money for a lending facility through Treasury for small businesses, but the Federal Reserve TALF program has only lent roughly $116 million back with small business loans. Meanwhile Treasury's $15 billion SBA loan purchase program has yet to make a single transaction. Given these factors, do you think more should be done to restart the secondary market for SBA loans?"
"Ms. Blankenship","I certainly continue to say that the secondary market plays a very critical role because you understand that when we make those loans, our bank does not typically hold the loans. We sell those guaranteed portions back into the secondary market, allowing us to then re-leverage those funds into additional loans. When there is no secondary market, then that is what causes the freeze of credit. We are seeing some recovery on the bank side in the secondary market. I think the dealer side is still suffering. The TALF program, I think the challenges there were that you had to go through a primary dealer, and there were some issues about releasing your customers' names, and so that is an issue. The White House plan, I am not sure what the holdup is there. So whatever we need to do, we need to make sure that we continue to look at the secondary market and continue to push initiatives that will restore that market and restore the confidence, and that is really what it boils down to is the confidence in that market. Chairwoman Velazquez. But you feel that the way the program was structured it will unlock the secondary market?"
"Ms. Blankenship","I think there is a ways to go yet. I think perhaps maybe a panel of bankers and broker-dealers could be brought in and maybe asked their opinion. Where is the freeze occurring? What is the holdup? Is it the paperwork? Is it the burden? And, you know, with the TALF funds, there were additional restrictions placed on banks and brokers. So that is an issue. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. McGannon."
"Mr. McGannon","I would certainly agree with Cynthia. As far as Country Club Bank goes, we have always held our SBA loans. I think that we just have never had reliance on the secondary market. If it is out of our control, I think that we feel like we need to try to take care of what we are funding. But Cynthia is right. If the secondary market does open up, it does give every bank an opportunity to re-leverage those dollars into more SBA lending. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thanks. Mr. Heacock, do you believe that the Small Business Administration is doing enough to encourage and train new lenders to participate in this program?"
"Mr. Heacock","I cannot say I have an answer to that. Chairwoman Velazquez. That is troubling."
"Mr. Heacock","Well, whether they are doing enough because in our area we have had a great relationship with the district office, and we get all of the assistance we need as far as training. They have monthly teleconferences, and so we really do get adequate training. Nationwide I cannot speak to that, but locally, excellent. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Now I recognize the gentleman, Mr. Graves, Ranking Member."
"Mr. Graves","Thanks, Madam Chair. My first question is to Ms. Huels. Has the economy changed as far as your investment practices go? With the downturn in the economy, have you changed your policies or practices or backed off or anything like that?"
"Ms. Huels","We have not. We invest primarily in midwest based industrial manufacturing companies, and while many may think manufacturing has declined in this country, we find there are significant opportunities to invest in growing middle market, lower middle market manufacturing companies. We have not changed our profile. If there is a profile that has changed, it is really the availability of senior lending available to us. So what we have done is we have had to write a little bit bigger check and provide more of the capital because the senior lenders are typically providing less."
"Mr. Graves","When you talk about middle range, what is that range?"
"Ms. Huels","For us the middle market is a company with seven to $100 million in revenues, relatively small companies in comparison to some of the large multinationals we read about."
"Mr. Graves","And my next question is for the lenders out there, and we can start with Mr. McGannon, and it is the same question as far as your lending practices go in light of the economy. Have you all backed off? Have you increased? I mean, are you requiring more from investors?"
"Mr. McGannon","We had a 12 percent increase in loan activity in 2008, and looking back at 2008 just briefly, we got off to a slow start, not unlike 2009 in terms of actual loan growth. We accelerated throughout the year, even through September into the end of the year of 2008, when obviously things started to cycle downward in the economy. In 2009, we have had just moderate growth year to date, but I can tell you that our pipeline is growing in terms of pending loan requests. There was more activity in April in terms of new loans booked than we had since last September. So am encouraged by that. Our loan requests are down. It is a quieter time. Without question I think there are a lot of borrowers that are reassessing whatever their business is. But having said that, we are gaining market share from other financial institutions in the Kansas City marketplace. Our underwriting, I get that question asked a lot. Our underwriting really has not changed. We feel like we have had a strong credit culture in our bank for many years. Certainly we are more concerned about collateral values, and so we may, in fact, when you think about underwriting, we may well, in fact, require more money down on a particular project if it is real estate related, as an example. But by and large, our underwriting remains unchanged."
"Mr. Graves","How about the credit unions, Mr. Heacock?"
"Mr. Heacock","Thank you. We have not backed off at all. As I said before, we wrote more SBA loans than any other lender in South Dakota last year, and it is continuing this year. As far as non-SBA loans, we had a record year last year and it is continuing very, very strong. Credit unions nationwide, for the most part, have plenty of capital to lend, and we have had, I know, locally some financial institutions that are not willing to lend to some small businesses. Also, they are changing some terms and conditions. They are coming to us. Oftentimes we can help them. Sometimes we cannot, but we are there and available and have the funding."
"Mr. Graves","Ms. Blankenship."
"Ms. Blankenship","Yes. Actually our loans increased just over ten percent from 2007 to 2008 as well, but interestingly, our SBA loan percentages have been running about two to two and a half percent per year of our total portfolio. This year it is running 6.38. So we have really gotten behind a push to use the SBA program because what banks are facing right now is kind of a double-edged sworn. You hear Congress saying, ``Lend, lend, lend,'' but then the examiners are overreacting and they are coming in and we are getting stories of, you know, all commercial real estate being classified. So, you know, in my opinion, this is an opportune time to use the SBA program because you can mitigate some of that because you have that guaranty. Because the overwhelming majority of SBA loans will include typically, at least in our portfolio, some type of real estate as collateral. So we really need to mitigate the overreaction from the examining force. Again, I think it has been stated today there is an opportune time. The only other thing that I think would make the program more accessible in these times is perhaps raising the limits that we currently have on the size of 7(a) loans, and I think also on the 504s. So I think that would help a lot."
"Mr. Graves","Jean, how about the development side?"
"Ms. Wojtowicz","Well, if you take a look at our national statistics, we saw record years in 2006 and 2007. Two thousand eight fell off significantly, and 2009 is off again, at least in our own portfolio in the national statistics as well. We cannot do a 504 loan unless we have a bank partner. I would say that when I look at my list of partners that are working with us on transactions, it does tend to be more of the community banks and fewer of the national lenders in that scope. The high point is starting to grow, but certainly not yet at a level to return us to where we were two years ago, and it is a significant concern. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Moore."
"Mr. Moore","Thank you, Madam Chair. And I would like to welcome Mr. McGannon, who is from our area in the Kansas City area, and I appreciate all of the witnesses who are testifying today. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act signed into law by President Obama in March included a number of provisions designed to increase small business lending through Small Business Administration programs. Specifically, the stimulus law increased to 90 percent the SBA guarantee on 7(a) loans, temporarily waived the guarantee fee on 7(a) loans, and provided incentives to restate the secondary market in which lenders sell portions of SBA loans to private brokers and investors. What effect has the Recovery Act had on your ability to make SBA-backed loans? And I would ask that question to any of the witnesses who care to answer."
"Ms. Blankenship",""
"Ms. Blankenship","Yes. Well, as I stated just earlier, our percentage of our total loan portfolio has been running about two and a half and now it is almost six and a half. And so we have really utilized that program, and just as of yesterday we had the local SBA office out of the Dallas area come in and talk to 20 of our lenders about the enhanced programs both on the 504 and the 7(a) because we, again, feel like this is the time to really maximize the use of this program."
"Mr. Moore","Very good. Any other witnesses? Mr. Heacock, and Mr. McGannon, you will be next."
"Mr. Heacock","I know on a state level, the temporary elimination of fees has been very, very important. Apparently the volume declined quite a bit at the end of last year, last fall, but with the elimination of fees the volume has picked up considerably."
"Mr. Moore","Thank you."
"Mr. McGannon",""
"Mr. McGannon","I would agree. I think that like any other product, it has to be competitive, and to eliminate the guarantee fee makes the product more competitive to other traditional bank financing vehicles. I would also say that the ARC program is very timely, and I think that it will serve a direct purpose. I can think of three or four borrowers in our bank right now that would certainly qualify and benefit from a program like that."
"Mr. Moore","Thank you, Mr. McGannon. Madam Chair, I had a second question on secondary markets, but you have already asked the question. So I will yield back my time and thank you very much to the witnesses. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Luetkemeyer."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Ms. Blankenship, you made a comment a minute ago and during your testimony with regards to the impact of regulatory authorities coming into the bank. Can you elaborate on that a little bit more?"
"Ms. Blankenship","Certainly. What we have seen is just because of the past six months and the financial meltdown that we are all getting painted with the same brush, and while the big banks got bailed out and were given the TARP money, their primary intent for that was to lend money. But yet what we are hearing from small businesses is that they cannot get it. This is a double-edged sword because the banks are willing to lend. They have capital to lend. We have heard that here today, and that continues to be true the community banks, but the examiners are painting us all with one brush. They are painting the small banks the same way they do the two big to fail banks. And so when they come in and say, ``Okay. If you have got commercial real estate,'' and we have heard stories like this, ``we are going to classify it across the board,'' well, even if you are using an SBA program for our reporting purposes, that has to be reported as commercial real estate, and if you have a regional office, regardless of what the mandate is from Washington, sometimes the examiners in the field do not always carry the same operating procedures and practices as we hear out of the head offices in Washington. So it can make banks hesitant to make those types of loans because at a time like this, we cannot afford for perhaps you are a well capitalized bank, and if you have certain classifications, your ratings go down and you fall into adequately capitalized. Then your FDIC assessment goes up, and all of our costs. There is a tremendous amount of cost being levied on the small banks right now."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","You are a great witness. You answered the question perfectly. I do not have to do any more leading questions with you."
"Mr. McGannon","May I add something? I am sorry."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Yes. You are next, sir."
"Mr. McGannon","Okay."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Go ahead."
"Mr. McGannon","Cynthia obviously is right about the regulatory environment. Examinations have never been tougher, and I have found myself on many occasions really working hard to defend in front of regulators good customers of the bank, good borrowers, performing loans. You know, maybe there is a shortfall from a collateral standpoint, but again, that is a secondary source of repayment, the primary source of repayment being their business and their income that they are generating, how they are stepping up to support their businesses. And so it takes a few days to get over an examination and literally to get back into being upbeat about lending into your community. That is what we all want to do. That is what we are paid to do as a community bank. It is our duty to do that, but you almost have to really regroup after an examination."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","It has been my experience in dealing with the banking community in my district and my state that there seems to be a disconnect from Washington and the local regulators. Is that what you are seeing? In other words, Washington says we have not changed our criteria. We have not changed our examination procedures or the way we look at stuff, and yet when you have the examiners come in, it is a whole different world with the way they come in, and they, again, paint you with a broad brush, as Ms. Blankenship said."
"Mr. McGannon","It is very true."
"Ms. Blankenship","That is correct."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","One of the questions that I want to have for you two again, as well, with regards to the TARP funds, did either one of your two institutions take any of those?"
"Mr. McGannon","No."
"Ms. Blankenship","I did not."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Okay. One of the questions that has been posed to me with regard to the TARP funds is initially they were supposed to be for the banks that were in trouble, for the institutions that were in trouble, and as I have seen the funds dispersed, it seems like it has gone to more and more institutions that are not in trouble. And in fact, I have found that some of the banks were asked to take the money so that they would go out and buy other banks rather than actually absorb weak assets. Have you seen or heard of instances like that or are you aware that we have an opportunity maybe to help a weak bank with the TARP funds that we have not taken advantage of?"
"Ms. Blankenship","As I understand from Treasury Secretary Geithner was present at one of our meetings several weeks ago, and he indicated that there would be an initiative for some of the perhaps returned TARP funds to go to some of the banks that had applied and perhaps had missed the deadline or did not qualify the first time around. I think just from my experience I am hearing that a lot of smaller community banks have opted not necessarily to use that program because of the regulatory burden associated with it, and typically those banks are well capitalized. We did not use it. We would have considered possibly using it, and I think there are some opportunities for an additional program perhaps that would fund M&A activity of, say, a strong community bank to acquire a weak or a failing community bank with the assistance, but I do not know that under the current program a lot of banks would be willing to accept the terms associated with that. But I think you could take those TARP funds and perhaps look at another initiative if you wanted to look at the M&A."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Very good. Thank you. Thank you, Madam Chairman Chairwoman Velazquez. Ms. Bean."
"Ms. Bean","thank you, Madam Chairwoman, for holding the Committee and this hearing. It has been an important issue, access to affordable capital for our small businesses. I want to thank our witnesses today for echoing the importance of the small business to our economic recovery and the importance of access to capital. This week before I came out to Washington, I hosted in Illinois, which I represent with Senator Durbin a round table of small businesses who had been participating or were considering working with the SBA lending programs, and some had expressed past frustrations, but also like many of you today have expressed hopefulness about the new programs and some of the things that were done on the stimulus. And we really did it to help get the word out. I know one of the questions from one of my colleagues was is the SBA getting the word out. I know in Illinois they were very helpful in trying to let people become aware of some of the new resources that are available. And I know, Ms. Blankenship, you had been there with us at the press conference at the White House when the President had committed the $15 billion to try and get additional funding to get the secondary market moving, but I think that was following the AIG bonus fallout. So the press entirely did not cover it. So in an effort to let some of our community lenders and businesses know, we hosted a round table. It was very well received. The good news that I was hearing from them, and I just want to get your thoughts, was that they are seeing from where particularly in the secondary market it had been up at about 325, 328 million per month, was the activity; so many of the community banks in our area were finding about roughly half of the SBA loans they would write they would then move quickly into the secondary market and, as you said, they could then recycle that capital back into new loans; that it dropped off after September with the credit crunch to a low point of only 85 million. And so at a time when businesses needed even more access to capital, there was less available, but from what I have heard, and again, Ms. Blankenship mentioned it in your testimony, we have seen that now get closer to those levels back pre- September in recent weeks, and so that is a hopeful thing. And I know they have also, in talking to Administrator Mills at the SBA, they have really worked to address some of the issues to get the 15 billion moving, and they are just getting training going on that. I just wanted to see if you had any further thoughts about the ARC programs, which will be loans and increments of 35,000 that should start rolling out June 15th, to help. It is something that the Chairwoman and many of us on the Committee have long advocated for, is to allow businesses who have been longstanding, ongoing. profitable entities, sometimes businesses that have been around for generations, who have seen their credit lines dry up, either taken away or reduced significantly even without a late payment, and so in response to that they have had to find other higher cost avenues of credit. This is going to allow them to restructure that debt, get zero interest loans, and increments of 35,000. What are your thoughts about that? Obviously there is limited funding. It is tied to the stimulus at this time. And the other question I have is some of the programs that we have seen that are core within the SBA lending program are very targeted to new businesses or smaller entities who have less of a direct impact on the job growth in some of our middle market types of companies. Is there more that we can be doing there, to whomever wants to take this?"
"Ms. Blankenship","Well, I will start. Regarding the ARC loan program, you know, I think it is a great program to help some of those distressed small business customers, but one thing that we have to consider as banks, I think it was the OIG's office had an estimated default rate on those loans of 70 percent. So I think you are going to find some hesitancy on the part of banks to make a loan that has an estimated default rate of 70 percent because, again, when we are in this crushing regulatory environment, the last thing we need are more loans to be classified. The second thing is it says that there is still no definition for the term ``viable.'' It has to be a ``viable'' loan. So I think bankers just need some clarification there so they have some confidence when they make that loan that the SBA guaranty will stand behind the terms of that. But outside of that I think it is a terrific program. I think we really just need to hold its hand and walk through it and make sure it is working the way it was intended."
"Mr. McGannon","I would say on the ARC program specifically I think it is very important that the bank that has been the lender to that business also be the lender on the ARC loan. I do not think it is a good idea for that same borrower to go to another bank to get that loan. And the reason why I say that is when we first heard about this program at our bank a month or so back, I had three different lenders come to me and say, ``I think I have a borrower that would benefit from this program,'' and when we talked about each one of them, you could clearly see that they were existing customers of the bank, obviously, had been with us for a year or two or more, had proven themselves in terms of being resourceful, resilient borrowers, and that they had a clear temporary need to get through a cash cycle. And so, again, the banker that knows the borrower and understands their business is the most appropriate banker to make that loan. As far as the overall 7(a) program, I think it is critical to, if we can, extend the waiving of the guaranty fee to make that program competitive with other traditional bank financing vehicles. If that could be done, I think that there would be more and accelerated momentum for 7(a) loans to get back to where they once were and beyond. The other part of this though I think is the outreach to smaller, maybe rural banks that just do not know enough about the SBA programs, are not confident enough in the SBA programs, not knowledgeable enough to implement and actually make some of these loans. Chairwoman Velazquez. Time has expired."
"Mr. Coffman",""
"Ms. Bean","Thank you."
"Mr. Coffman","Thank you, Madam Chairman. Mr. McGannon and Ms. Blankenship, I get complaints from my local bankers and from my small businesses, but particularly from my local bankers who say that, on one hand, the federal government wants them to lend and, on the other hand, I think just the regulatory scheme is such that it is kind of the zero defects, that you know, they had a 20 percent increase, I think, in their capital reserve requirements, if I am using the proper term, ten to 12 percent, and that has caused them to pull back on their lending. I mean, have we gone too far on the regulatory side where we are not allowing bankers to exercise their own judgment in terms of the ability of the borrower to repay the loan? Could you address that issue? Ms. Blankenship, we will start with you."
"Ms. Blankenship","Certainly. Again, we cannot be painted with the same brush, and you know, yes, has the regulatory gone too far right now? Yes, it has because you find banks are hesitant to lend because of the increasing costs that I talked about. The FDIC, we are additionally being asked to put more money in loan loss reserve. So that takes the money out of loans, money available that could be leveraged back into loans. So all of those are challenges right now. To make this program more effective, we have to continue, as I said, to look at the initiatives and what is working and get back to less paperwork and involving more banks in this program. Additionally, you know, if we could get some Subchapter S reform, you would find that a lot of small businesses could raise their own capital. Right now they are restricted to one type of stock. If they could be allowed to issue preferred stock and increase their shareholders. So I think there are many ways that we could approach this, but again, to really answer your question, the regulatory environment, until we can get some equity there and know that the way you supervise a too big to fail bank is not the way you supervise a small business bank, which is what we are."
"Mr. Coffman","Okay."
"Mr. McGannon","We realize the regulators are under a lot of pressure, and I will say that our examinations are more difficult, but I continue to think that they are fair. We spend more time discussing our borrowers, as I mentioned earlier. Even though they are performing well, they are going through several more layers, I think, in our portfolio, and again, I can only speak to our bank, but they are fair. They just want to learn as much as they can about what our borrowers are doing and how they are performing. And, again, I certainly understand that."
"Mr. Coffman","Would anyone else like to comment on that? Yes."
"Mr. Heacock","I would just like to say from a credit union perspective, we have been heavily regulated for many years on business loans, a tremendous amount of regulation, but having said that, so far our examinations have been fair. I have heard from other colleagues that maybe there is not that kind of consistency. In other areas of the country the examinations are very difficult, and it is maybe kind of anti-business lending philosophy on the part of the examiner."
"Mr. Coffman","Would anybody comment on the fact that I often hear that the other shoe is going to drop and it is the exposure to commercial real estate, and what will that do to lending? Is that going to further tighten it up? What is your prognosis of the future here?"
"Mr. McGannon","We are concerned about commercial real estate, but I think just to make the distinction, commercial real estate covers a lot of different types of property. When we think about commercial real estate in terms of owner occupied commercial real estate where a business owner owns his or her building, we continue to have confidence because it all hinges on how his or her business is doing, how are they performing. So the collateral truly is secondary in nature. The commercial real estate in terms of hotels and multi- family and those types of things, you know, we are concerned about where cap rates are going, where appraised values are currently, and certainly there is a watchful eye toward that part of the market."
"Mr. Coffman","Thank you very much. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. I would like to ask Ms. Huels another question. You made reference to the need for improving licensing functions and particularly for SBICs that have successfully operated funds that are simply seeking a license renewal. What changes would you tell us should be made to the licensing process to encourage the creation of new SBICs?"
"Ms. Huels","Successful SBIC fund managers that are coming back for a second, third, or fourth license, there is no additional risk. If they are an SBIC in good standing, they have been examined; they have had no findings; and their management team is remaining the same or most of the management team is remaining the same, you know, with a background check because hopefully nothing has changed there, but I think a background check would be something prudent and the fund manager showing that they can raise additional private capital or new private capital, that fund ought to be formed and receive a license very quickly. These are fund managers that are known to the SBA. They are in good standing and should receive a license quickly. We had an example of a second or a third fund licensee that took 17 months to receive a second or third license. It was just far too long of a process. Chairwoman Velazquez. For the creation of new SBICs?"
"Ms. Huels","Creation of new SBICs should happen in a three to six-month time frame. I think we would prefer four months. The process is at this point too long. It can take longer than a year to receive a first time license, a process that is a little bit cumbersome, a lot of paper work and somewhat subjective. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. Heacock, if a credit union has never made a 7(a) or 504 loan before, what resources does it need to become familiar with SBA's financing programs?"
"Mr. Heacock","That would be a pretty steep learning curve if you have never done one. Yes, you would need to work with your local office, if you have got a local representative, and of course with the state office, the district office to learn as much as possible because there are a lot of procedural steps that you need to take and you need to follow. If you do not follow those correctly, you can lose your guarantee. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. McGannon."
"Mr. McGannon","Outreach is very important. I think that education is very important in all of these programs, and it is certainly lacking, and I do not know at what level we need to start, but we are fortunate to have someone in our office who has been an SBA lender for probably 15 years and just knows the ins and outs of the program very well. So when we have another lender even in our bank that is looking at an SBA loan, we make sure that she is on the front end of it and understands it and can make sure it is documented properly. So there is definitely a learning curve involved here. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Okay. Mr. Graves, do you have any other questions? Well, let me take this opportunity again to thank all of you for being here today, and you are dismissed or excused. Thank you. I would ask the members of the second panel to please come forward. We are going to proceed with our second panel. Let me welcome our first witness, Mr. Douglas Doerfler. He is the President and CEO of MaxCyte, Inc., Gaithersburg, Maryland. MaxCyte is s research and development company that concentrates on self-modification. He is testifying on behalf of the Biotechnology Industry Organization founded in 1993. Bio provides advocacy and services for more than 1,200 members worldwide. Welcome. You will have five minutes to make your presentation."
"STATEMENT OF DOUGLAS A. DOERFLER",""
"Mr. Doerfler","Thank you, and good afternoon, Madam Chair Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify in front of this Committee during a very, very difficult, time for the research and development based companies that I represent. As mentioned, I am Doug Doerfler. I am founding CEO of MaxCyte in Gaithersburg, Maryland. We are a research and development company developing technologies to modify cells, make cells into drugs to treat diseases like pulmonary arterial hypertension, leukemia and brain cancer. We have products in clinical trials today. We have about 20 people in the company. So we are clearly a small business. I am also associated with Bio and on the board of directors, and of the 1,200 companies that are members of Bio, more than 90 percent are considered small companies. So the biotechnology industry is an industry with small companies. We are small, and what is important about this is our inability to raise necessary capital to maintain the research and development programs that we have as companies at Bio. A little bit about the industry. We employ directly about 1.3 million jobs in the U.S., and indirectly over seven million jobs, and these are particularly high paying jobs with the average employee making two-thirds more than the average private sector job. According to the latest data, one-eighth of the U.S. biotechnology companies that were active in 2008 are either bankrupt today, they have winded down or become acquired. And since January of 2008, over 125 biotech companies have laid off over 10,000 scientists and employees. In doing so, they have dropped many important programs. These are clinical programs that we have data on involved in therapies for HIV, cervical cancer, multiple sclerosis, and diabetes. Forty percent of the U.S. biotech companies have less than one year's worth of cash, and about a quarter have less than six months' worth of cash. And the total amount of capital that we raised sine 2008 has fallen 55 percent from 2008 to 2009. We commissioned a study with biotech investors, and over 80 percent of investors in the biotech area have significantly altered their ways of investing. They now are no longer investing in high risk, high reward companies like those found in the biotech industry. What is also disturbing is investments by angel investors in the life sciences industry has all but disappeared. There are just no angels out there to help support some of the earlier stage companies. So there is little oxygen in this industry to survive, and once these companies fold up or we stop clinical programs, it is virtually impossible to revive these. So once we stop a program for a particular therapy, it is very difficult to get them back on their feet. So the decline of the biotech industry jeopardizes not only the patient population but also our competitive edge in the 21st century global economy. Biotech is one of the few industries in the world that the United States is the predominant force in. This is for developing therapies. It is for developing alternative fuels and for developing alternative food sources. So the question: how can SBA provide assistance to early stage, high risk, high reward small businesses like mine? This is a biotech focused discussion, at least from my perspective, but I have colleagues in the alternative fuels area and in the information and technology industries and they share some of the same concerns that I do. First, the SBIR program has traditionally been enormously helpful to small biotech companies, and after the 2003 ruling which has prevented many of our small companies from participating due to their capital structure, there was a recent report issued by the National Research Council that stated that some of the most promising small companies, small, innovative companies were excluded from this program. Until this is addressed and small U.S. biotechnology businesses are allowed to compete based on science and the potential to benefit public health and not on how many investors we have or how many minority investors we have, this program will not achieve its maximum impact, which is helping high risk, high reward companies to succeed. Access to many of the SBA programs we heard about in the earlier panel that could help small, high risk, high reward technology businesses are unfortunately limited. Most of our companies, most biotech companies, do not have any revenue resources, and it usually takes about ten years for us to actually begin to bring in revenues. So it is impossible for us to take advantage of the SBA premier programs such as Preferred Lender or the guaranty loan programs. The SBIC programs also tend to focus on companies with revenue streams that are beyond the start-up phase. These companies are typically lower risk and lower gain companies, and Bio would like to work closely with the Committee and SBA to determine if there are ways in which this program can be improved to stimulate more investment in high risk, high reward industries like Biotech. In order to develop programs to promote our innovative high growth sector, we need to talk about the business model for just a minute, and there are really four elements of this. One is there is a lengthy amount of time, lengthy time horizon associated with product development. That is number one. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Doerfler, your time expired, and I will allow for you in 30 seconds to provide us with a closing. But you know, during the question and answer period you will have time to expand on any point that you have not mentioned."
"Mr. Doerfler","Okay. Thank you. Our long time horizons; our collateral is not assets as intellectual property; and revenues are not significant for about ten years. So what we are here to do is examine these potential opportunities with SBA and work closely with you to figure out ways for us to help in developing new fundings sources for our companies. Sorry. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Our next witness is Mr. Lawrence Cohen. Mr. Cohen is the President of DOC & Associates in Tomball, Texas. His firm is a franchisee of the Great American Cookie Company and Pretzel Tying. Mr. Cohen is testifying on behalf of the International Franchise Association. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE ``DOC'' COHEN",""
"Mr. Cohen","Good afternoon, Chairwoman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and members of the Committee. My name is Doc Cohen, and I am grateful to have the opportunity to speak to you about the credit crunch and the strong measures that are needed to promote capital access for small business. I will try to make three key points today. The first is fairly obvious. Credit is essential for small business. The second, this is not a typical recession, and many more small businesses need the capital access programs of the SBA in order to obtain financing. I think policy makers should be willing to consider even temporarily further changes to the SBA programs, including sizable increases in the dollar amounts for the SBA 7(a) loan program, guarantees to accommodate the needs of small business. And third, a compelling case exists that franchise businesses offer the best opportunity to promote job growth in a strong, sustainable recovery. As you said, I am a franchisee at the Great American Cookie Company, and I am here on behalf of the International Franchise Association. According to a 2008 study conducted for the IFA educational foundation, there are more than 900,000 franchise businesses in the U.S. creating 21 million American jobs and generating 2.3 trillion in economic output. I am proud to represent franchising. The business methods, training and support that I have received as a franchisee have been one of the keys to my success. From my first Great American Cookie Company store in Lafayette, Louisiana 30 years ago, I now operate 30 stores in the Houston, Texas area, and we employ almost 300 people. I was very fortunate that when I began my career in franchising there was a functioning credit market, including the SBA programs. Availability of credit helped me succeed in franchising. Today's small business entrepreneurs, however, are not quite so lucky. Under normal circumstances small businesses tap financing from a number of different sources, including the SBA programs, but during this recession, lenders have dramatically curbed their willingness to assume risk. Some credit might be available, but the terms and delays that entrepreneurs are encountering can be staggering. This leaves the SBA as virtually the only girl at the dance, sometimes not the best looking girl. Last year I had the opportunity to add eight new locations. I had previously acquired a reducing line of credit from my lender of ten years, but it appeared that I would need additional funds in order to complete my expansion. The answer I was given by my bank was not quite no, but the terms being offered in late 2008 had become all too restrictive. I could borrow an additional $500,000 more only if I agreed to keep a million dollars in liquid assets with the lender. In other words, they would lend me my own money, but only half of it."
"Mr. Cohen","My track record in business and my healthy balance sheet were not enough anymore. So I actually chose to forego the additional borrowing and finance the two new stores or the last two stores using cash generated from operations. The eight stores that I eventually opened required a capital investment of $1.8 million and created 74 new direct jobs, but I will likely delay opening additional stores until the restrictions on credit are eased. Lack of credit is keeping entrepreneurs on the sidelines and delaying our recovery, and the problem is even looking worse for those looking to get into business for the first time. The findings of a recently released study, The Small Business Lending Matrix and analysis prepared for the IFA Educational Foundation, support the notion that an economic recovery and job creation will start with small business lending. In fact, the study determined that for every million dollars in new small business lending, the franchise business sector would create 34.1 jobs and generate $3.6 million in economic output. Now, I would like to ask that this entire report be included with my statement if the Committee would approve that. Chairwoman Velazquez. Without objection."
"Mr. Cohen","Franchise businesses are poised to help lead the economy on the path to recovery. Studies show that the franchise industry consistently out performs the non-franchise business sector creating more jobs and economic activity in local communities across the country. A 2008 IFA report, for example, documents that franchising grew at a faster pace than many other sectors of the economy from 2001 to 2005. Franchise business output over this period increased 40 percent compared to 26 percent for all businesses. The message is clear, Madam Chairwoman, provide small business entrepreneurs and franchisees with access to capital and we will create jobs. We are not looking for a bailout. What we need is functioning credit markets. If the commercial markets cannot function, Congress needs to figure out a way to use the SBA as a temporary alternative. There are several steps that Congress could consider to make it easier for entrepreneurs to access capital, and I have detailed these recommendations in my prepared statements. I have one final note. Unbelievably, the SBA has actually created new roadblocks for small businesses during this recession. In March it shifted policy on goodwill financing of transfers and acquisitions and placed a cap on the amount that can be financed under the guaranteed loan program. Since the true value of most businesses is tied to the cash flow rather than the value of the assets on the books, the policy has placed an arbitrary limit on the valuation of some businesses. Finally, I would like to suggest the best solution for the struggles facing small business is more lending, not more government spending. As shown in my experience in the hundreds of thousands of small franchise businesses in every local community, lending leads to more sustainable renewable job growth and economic recovery. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's important hearing on small business capital. I think you will agree with the franchise business community can play a vital role in this recovery. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Cohen. Our next witness is Mr. Tim Watters. He is the President and CEO of Hoffman Equipment is Piscataway, New Jersey. Hoffman Equipment is a full service authorized dealer of heavy lifting and construction equipment. Mr. Watters is testifying on behalf of Associated Equipment Distributors. AED has 700 distributor member companies and accounts for over $50 billion of annual sales. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF TIM WATTERS",""
"Mr. Watters","Good afternoon, Chairman Velazquez, Ranking Member Graves, and other distinguished members of the panel. We are a family owned business headquartered in Piscataway, New Jersey. We sell, rent and service construction equipment. We represent about ten different manufacturers, including Case, Terex, Grove, Manitowoc and Doosan. We employ about 75 people from five locations in New York and New Jersey. And just as an aside, Madam Chairwoman, our service territory includes the 12th Congressional District of New York. We also have an export department, and about 20 percent of our volume is export related of U.S. equipment and parts. As you mentioned, I serve on the AED board. AED is a national association of authorized independent distributors for construction, mining, forestry, and agricultural equipment, and the vast majority of AED's members are small, locally owned family businesses such as mine. There are three ways the current credit crisis is hurting our industry. First is that as a distributor, my own cost of borrowing is increasing and in some cases credit may even be unavailable. Access to capital is critical to our industry. Distributors such as myself borrow money to finance equipment in our inventories and rental fleets and to operate our companies on a day-to-day basis. We generally utilize large banks and finance companies as sources for this lending. Continued access to credit from sources such as these is absolutely necessary for our industry to exist, and the current crisis has made it difficult, increasingly difficult for dealers such as myself to find this capital. The second way the crisis has hurt our industry is that our customers and the developers they work for cannot find financing for their jobs. You are all well aware of the current condition of the residential construction market. Essentially it is dead, and the commercial construction is slowing as well. Since developers cannot finance their projects, our customers have no work and so need no machinery, and we therefore have no business. The lack of credit creates a chain of events, painful events, I might add, that ultimately lead to decreased business and employment throughout our entire industry. The third way the credit crisis has impacted our industry is that we are unable to finance our customer's retail transactions. Contractors themselves rely heavily on credit when purchasing equipment. The most common sources of credit here again are finance companies and banks. These banks and finance companies have made access to their credit resources unavailable or, in the rare case when they are willing to finance a transaction, exceedingly expensive. So the net result is if we as a distributor are lucky enough to find a customer that has work and is actually willing to purchase a new machine, we then have difficult to finding him financing to make that transaction possible. In April, AED conducted a member survey to clarify what impact the credit crisis was having on our industry. The findings paint an ugly picture. Eighty-one percent of our respondents reported they had lost sales in the last year because qualified purchasers had been unable to get financing. Fifty-six percent of distributors reported increase in their own credit costs, and 44 percent of respondents said their companies had difficulty security credit. The findings illustrate that the lack of access to capital is undermining equipment markets and increasing the cost of doing business for equipment distributors. The impact of all of this on our markets has been staggering. In some regions of the country the market for new equipment sales has fallen by as much as 85 percent from peak levels in 2006. Our own company has experienced sales this year less than 50 percent of what we sold just last year. We have responded to this drop in business volume with layoffs and cutbacks of every type we can make, and we are still hanging on just hoping to survive this mess. Having said all of this, I think there are some things that Congress and the executive branch can do to help ease our pain. First, Congress should put new multi-year authorization laws in place for federal highway, sewer and drinking water infrastructure programs and dramatically increase investment in these areas. We need to create infrastructure construction activity. Investing in our infrastructure speeds economic recovery, will help address the staggering 19 percent unemployment rate in construction workers and restore lending confidence in our industry. This will also create demand for the thousands of products that are consumed on a typical construction project, including equipment sold by firms such as mine. Second, the SBA should be directed to work with finance companies and banks serving our industry to develop loan products that meet our unique needs. SBA should also reexamine its size standards to determine whether they are preventing companies that otherwise fit the definition of small business from benefitting from SBA programs. Once construction is reached and programs are in place, SBA should be encouraged to undertake aggressive outreach to lenders, contractors and distributors. And finally, and I will go quick, Congress and the executive branch should continue to work to improve access to capital for the finest companies that serve all American industry because in spite of what the banks were saying earlier, which they are continuing to lend at previous rates, that is not what we are seeing from the business side of things. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. And our next witness is Mr. Dave Bofill. Mr. Bofill is the President of Dave Bofill Marine in Long Island, New York. His firm is the nation's second largest and third largest seller of Scout and Cris Craft boats, respectively. Mr. Bofill is testifying on behalf of National Marine Manufacturers Association, which represents 1,400 companies that produce an estimated 80 percent of marine products used in North America. Welcome."
"STATEMENT OF DAVE BOFILL",""
"Mr. Bofill","Thank you. Good afternoon, Madam chairwoman, Ranking Member Graves, and distinguished members of this Committee. Thank you for inviting me to testify today on the important topic of expanding affordable wholesale marine floor plan financing access to marine dealerships. My name is David Bofill, and I am President and owner of Dave Bofill Marine. I come to you wearing three hats, one of my company, one of the National Marine Manufacturers Association, and one of being on the board of directors for the New York Marine Trade Association for the last eight years. I sell Cris Craft and Scout boats from my two Long Island locations. I have been in the boating industry for 35 years, and my operation at its peak employed 20 people. I am a small business and, in fact, the majority of the boating industry is made up of small businesses and most boats are might right here in the United States. The brands I carry, Cris Craft and Scout boats, are made in Florida, North Carolina, and South Carolina. Unfortunately, my story is being played out in both dealerships and manufacturing plants across the country. I have had a thriving business for over 35 years, but this credit crisis will force me to close my doors. What frustrates me the most is that most of us in the boating industry are used to riding the ups and downs of the economy, but this downturn is different. Today I am dealing with a reluctant consumer, but more so the sudden loss of wholesale credit at anything close to reasonable rates to finance my inventory. Over the last year, the floor plan lenders to the boating industry, including Key Bank, Textron Financial, Wachovia, and several others, have abruptly stopped lending in the boating industry. Some of these banks, as you know, received federal assistance under the TARP program, but severed their ongoing business relationships with the marine dealers anyway. Today, General Electric Capital has become the dominant lender with over 70 percent of the market. However, G.E. recently has informed all of us that they are radically changing loan terms resulting in doubling of interest payments and, in my case, my interest will go from 10,000 to $20,000 per month. Lenders overall have scaled back lending, dramatically increased their rates, cracked down on curtailments and are not issuing loans or extending current lines of credit to enable marine dealers to finance any new inventory. The inability of dealers to finance current inventory or purchase new model inventory to display means that manufacturers now have shut down production by at least 60 percent. With hundreds of dealerships being forced out of business as mine, 20,000 manufacturing jobs vanishing and 135,000 boating industry jobs that are now gone, something must be done. It is important that you know that these businesses like mine were not failing businesses or companies with flawed business models. We relied in good faith on lenders for typical business credit, and when the financial markets collapsed, we had nowhere to turn. What we need to survive is access to credit at reasonable terms. What Congress could do to help many small businesses in the boating industry is to facilitate the creation of new credit market. Both dealers and manufacturers need to help in encouraging regional banks to create or reestablish floor plan lending departments. The industry strongly supports the Small Business Administration's plan to establish a floor plan lending program for boats, motors and trailers. The industry has welcomed this program as a critical lifeline, but problems still remain. This Committee and Congress could help in three specific ways. One, make the SBA dealer floor plan financing program permanent and do it quickly. As written now, this program only lasts one year. It will be hard to attract new lenders without the important certainty of this program. Two, make the increased business size limits permanent. This is an important change that reflects the marketplace. The traditional standard for marine dealers is far too low to include dealers who sell high cost products but do so with such a small staff. Three, increase the cap on SBA 7(a) loans. The current limits are too low to provide financing for the majority of small dealers and manufacturers. It is common for a small boat dealer to have inventory in the $5 million range. Thank you for inviting me to testify today. The marine industry is suffering. It is an American industry of manufacturing and servicing that deserves support. The lack of reasonable credit is likely going to lead me to close my doors soon, and it will cause other dealers to shut down as well. Thank you, and I am happy to answer any questions. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you, Mr. Bofill. I just would like to address my first question to all the members of the panel. You were sitting there and you were listening to the previous witnesses, basically those representing financial services, banks and the credit unions, and what they are saying is that they have money to lend, and that by some metrics have actually increased their loans. And what I hear from you today, from this panel, is that that is not the experience that you have had. My question is do you think that the SBA should play a more direct role in small business lending either by refinancing non-SBA loans or making direct loans that could be sold to lenders? Any of the members of the panel, for any of the witnesses. Yes, Mr. Watters."
"Mr. Watters","For sure, the environment we witness is different than that which was described by the preceding panel. There is definitely a lack of financing available for my industry, for construction, every link of the chain of the construction cycle, from the contractor right down to we, the equipment distributor, and I would just say yes, wholeheartedly. If the SBA involvement as you just described can increase financing and credit availability to our industry, absolutely that would be a great thing. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Bofill."
"Mr. Bofill","I agree with Mr. Watters that in my industry credit has shut down completely. It is very, very difficult not only to wholesale finance a boat, but the retail financing as well. In fact, between us when we were listening to statistics, it is like, boy, I will tell you what. That is not in my neighborhood, and it is not in anybody's neighborhood. So if there is anything that SBA can do to assist in any format, be it wholesale financing or retail financing, it certainly will be welcome because that is better than what we have now because what we have right now is almost nothing. Chairwoman Velazquez. Let me address this next question to"
"Mr. Doerfler","A common failing in government investment programs is a tendency to focus on unrealistic metrics to determine a program's success. How should success in an investment program geared toward small, high growth companies be measured?"
"Mr. Doerfler","Well, that is a great question. I mean, first off, this is a long-term bet, if you will. It is a long-term investment, and as I mentioned before, it takes about ten years for us to get to revenues and beyond that to really return what our investors expect from us. So you are not going to see any finance return in the short term. But there are some metrics, and I think they are industry specific. Certainly the creation of new jobs, the creation of payroll taxes, the ability to spend money and have indirect benefits to the economy. In my particular sector, it is the ability to use that investment as a catalyst for additional investment, which is very, very important. We are looking at issues, certain things like issue patents, clinical trials that have been started. All those things, I think, are industry specific. So I think that there are a lot of ways that we can identify these. Certainly in my State of Maryland, we spend a lot of time doing just that because we want to make sure that these funds are being used and they are being used properly and they are returning something to those who are providing those. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Cohen, in the current recession, businesses of all sizes have been squeezed by the contraction in credit. We hear that. You witness it, and many companies that previously did not have access to SBA financing have shown interest in these programs. What steps should be taken to insure that these programs remain focused on the small businesses that they are originally intended to serve?"
"Mr. Cohen","That is also a great question. All of your questions are great questions. I am not an economist, but my sense is that so much of the money that is being pumped into the economy is going into the mortgage sector and into the real estate sector and not that much is going into the small business sector. It seems to me that we need to find a way to dedicate a certain pool of funds to small businesses, especially small business start-ups and expansions of small businesses. And if I might tag onto the question you asked about how you measure the success rate, in the franchise businesses, we have lots of historical data and proof that the franchising model works, and so when considering a start-up franchise, we do have evidence to show that a particular model will work, a particular concept will work. And I think we should rely on those statistics when we are looking at making those loans and not so much on a sector which is sometimes done. I think the SBA rates sectors and says, ``Well, this sector is not as successful as others.'' But I think if we pull out and say, ``Well, gee, when that sector is franchised, it is far more successful.'' Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. I have my last question to Mr. Doerfler. Much of the success of the SBIC debenture programs has come from the fact that losses in the program are low. If a new investment program were to focus on early stage and high growth companies, how can we manage the risk of losses and provide some assurance that government leverage will be repaid?"
"Mr. Doerfler","So the debenture program is a loan program, and it is my understanding we are not part of that because I think it is toward revenue producing companies or companies that are relatively low risk. If you are looking at something like the participating security program, the old SBIC program and trying to figure out something new to do with that, it is defunct now. We think that it could be very, very important. But I recommend, we recommend that we align ourselves with the really talented investors. There is a group of investors out there that really know our sector extraordinarily well. They have been through many cycles. They are very experienced, and aligning ourselves, aligning SBA funds with those investors, either as limited partners or as grant mechanisms so that the companies that receive investments from these qualified investors can get grants from the government, and those grants can be paid back by royalties; they can be paid back by if the company is acquired or an IPO. So there is certainly a number of ways to that, but, again, I think aligning it with smart investors who really do know the sector. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. Thank you."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer",""
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Thank you, Madam Chair. Mr. Bofill, you had a lot of great examples of things that you felt we could do, improvements in the SBA program. Do you have any other ideas for what is existing in the program now? Do you have any ideas or suggestions of things we could add to it that would be important or could make it more beneficial?"
"Mr. Bofill","The goal for me being here today was to back the decision of the SBA to get into marine floor planning. The way it stands right now as it is written is that it is only good for one year. So we need to expand that to permanency. And the whole goal of the SBA backed loans or guaranteed loans is to attract banks, regional banks into the floor plan business, and that will only be done with permanency and with more dollars without the $2 million cap that is on there presently. And that will benefit both the banking industry as well as the dealerships."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Okay. Mr. Watters."
"Mr. Watters","I guess I am not really sure of the exact process the SBA could do to solve the problem. I think part of the problem is that there is a pendulum, and we have had an era of loose credit, and now we are in this new era of tight credit, and I think the pendulum has swung way too far. It is overly tight, constricting all of these markets. So I guess I would love to see a way that the SBA could entice banks to try and push the pendulum back a little more center. There are good quality credit, quality companies that are being denied credit or being forced to pay too much money for their interest rates. Is there a way that SBA could create a program that would encourage banks to be a little more realistic? You know, that was also mentioned in the preceding panel, how the regulators who are going to be coming out and creating this environment, the culture of the banks to be very, very concerned and afraid about everything they are doing. So some type of program that would encourage banks to become a little more reasonable."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Okay. Mr. Cohen."
"Mr. Cohen","I keep coming back to the two points that are key to me, and one is the valuation of businesses and the treatment of goodwill, and just to give you an example of how that affects me as a small business person, if I want to acquire another outlet from another franchisee with the expectation that I can improve that business, I am limited in how much SBA money I can borrow because my business is not capital intensive in terms of the investment going in. So if I have 100,000 or $150,000, to use the higher number, $150,000 in equipment, fixtures and furniture on the books, but the cash flow of this business is $200,000, and then I am going to use a multiple of cash flow to purchase or sell that business, which is very common in our sector, and the multiple in our sector would be four to five. So you would be conservative and say four. This business is worth $800,000. But I have only $100,000 or $150,000 in assets on the books. So the book value is low, but I have $650,000 difference that is going to go to goodwill. I would not be able to use the SBA right now to qualify for that. The other part of it that would be important to me would be increasing the loan amounts because in franchise businesses we find that 50 percent of franchise businesses are owned by multi-unit franchisee. So I have an opportunity right now to acquire two other franchisees in my state, both of whom are ready to retire, neither of who wants to expand their business. I see great growth potential in both of those markets, but it will take my ability to borrow three to $5 million to do that. So I cannot qualify under the current SBA standards to get those loans and get that assistance."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Thank you."
"Mr. Doerfler",""
"Mr. Doerfler","So valuations based on high growth, high return businesses are difficult because the normal measures, cash flow or hard assets just are not in these businesses. Again, we are looking at negative cash flows for a number of years, and we are looking at intellectual property which is very hard to value. So, again, if SBA could align itself with private equity investors who have expertise in evaluating and valuing those assets and those assets are intellectual property and clinical programs, that would be a great benefit for the biotech industry."
"Mr. Luetkemeyer","Very good. Thank you. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Schrader."
"Mr. Schrader","Thank you, Madam Chair. I do not guess I have a lot of questions. Both panels were very, very good. Sorry I could not be here the whole time, as Chair of the Subcommittee on Tax and Finance and the lending programs, in particular, we are very interested in the comments that have been and the juxtaposition between one panel and the other. And to that end it would really be helpful for me and my Subcommittee if we could get a number of examples from members of your different associations, particularly that have had good credit, have been making payments, that now cannot get their loans or their credit lines or whatever reauthorized, you know, with various types of institutions because I have had somewhat the same feedback from my banking community, what seemed to be trying to do the right thing. So some of it is the regulators, in deference to the banks. I mean, the regulators have come down pretty hard, I think, and made it very difficult for them with their reserve requirements that have gone up to do the right thing, but to me that is something that our panel, our Subcommittee, if you will, could get into and from the SBA aspect maybe create some new opportunities. But I need some examples. So if that is a possibility, you know, several examples from each one of you would be very, very helpful for my staff, who has been here the whole time, to use and help create perhaps the right atmosphere to get things going back again. So that's all I request. I yield back, Madam Chair. Chairwoman Velazquez. Thank you. Mr. Watters, I would like to ask you. The Small Business Administration spent much of last month working on a new program to provide floor plan financing for title inventory. So will; this program have any appreciable effect on the ability of your business or your customers to access credit?"
"Mr. Watters","Probably not. It is really kind of a technical issue. Our equipment that we sell is non-titled. So if your program is directed at titled equipment only, titled vehicles only, then we would not be able to partake or benefit from that program. Chairwoman Velazquez. What about you, Mr. Cohen?"
"Mr. Cohen","I would be in the same category. It probably would not be of any benefit to me in my line. Chairwoman Velazquez. Mr. Bofill?"
"Mr. Bofill","That is exactly what we are looking for because all boats, motors, and trailers are titled. Chairwoman Velazquez. Okay. Well, gentlemen, we are listening, and of course, this is the first step in the legislative process where we are assessing how can we improve the existing programs, especially the loan business program under SBA. How can we make the changes to make them more efficient and to respond to the new reality and the economic climate that you are all facing today. With that I ask unanimous consent that members will have five days to submit a statement and supporting materials for the record. Without objection so ordered. This hearing is now adjourned. Thank you."
