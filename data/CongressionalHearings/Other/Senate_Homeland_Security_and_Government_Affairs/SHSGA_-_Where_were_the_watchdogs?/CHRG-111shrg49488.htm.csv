"Chairman Lieberman","The hearing will come to order. Good afternoon and welcome. As our Nation begins work under our brand-new President to recover from the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, we must ask how and why it happened. Is the existing U.S. financial regulatory system adequately equipped to protect consumers, investors, and our economy? A new report \1\ by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) that is the focus of today's hearing lays out a very persuasive case that the answer to that question is ``no.'' Over time, as the financial services sector has grown, moved in new directions, or suffered from scandals or crises, Congress has usually responded in a piecemeal fashion, grafting new regulatory agencies on top of one another. As a result, responsibilities for overseeing the financial services industry are today shared by over 200 different regulatory agencies at the Federal and State level, not to mention numerous self- regulatory organizations, such as the stock exchanges. \1\ The GAO Report referenced by Chairman Lieberman appears in the Appendix on page 366. GAO's report concludes that our current regulatory structure is outdated and unable to meet today's challenges and highlights several key changes in financial markets that have exposed significant gaps and limitations in our ability to protect the public interest. Some of GAO's observations are familiar to Members of this Committee. We have heard over the years about the careless lending practices that led to the current subprime mortgage crisis, the increasing number of overleveraged financial institutions that need to be bailed out by the government, the failures of credit-reporting agencies to provide credible ratings for increasingly complex financial products, and the inability of regulators to uncover or in some sense respond to the world's largest ever Ponzi scheme. It gives this Committee no satisfaction to note that some of these shortcomings were highlighted over 6 years ago in our investigation both by the full Committee and the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations following the collapse of Enron. And there we noted the inadequacies of the credit-rating agencies and the failures of regulators to notice the red flags that warned of massive financial fraud. Rather than contributing to the stability of financial markets, our fractured regulatory system seems to encourage financial institutions to play regulators against one another. New and complex financial products have been created that bypass these antiquated regulatory regimes. In some derivatives markets, the regulation is absent altogether. All in all, these problems surely contributed to the build- up of systemic risks and the eventual breakdown in credit and financial markets in the last year that has put millions of people out of work, destroyed so much of the savings and home values of the American people, and broken our economic confidence in the future. We have called this hearing today to take a government-wide look at our existing structure of regulation of financial services. We have asked today's witnesses--Gene Dodaro, Acting Comptroller General of the United States, Professor Howell Jackson of the Harvard Law School, and Professor Steven Davidoff of the University of Connecticut School of Law--to tell us if the current regulatory system adequately protects consumers, preserves the integrity of our markets, and protects the safety and soundness of our financial institutions. Given the scope of the crisis we face today on top of the crises that we have gone through over recent years, including-- and I go back a little further here--the savings and loan scandals, the dot-com bubble, and the Enron accounting mess that I mentioned, we think that now is the time to think, not just about regulatory reform, but about regulatory reorganization. Personally, I have not concluded if the way to fix our current system is to establish a single overarching super-regulatory agency, like that which exists in other developed countries, if it would be wiser simply to improve the ability of the existing regulatory bodies, or if the answer is somewhere in between. However, what I have concluded is that there are serious deficiencies in our current patchwork regulatory system, and before Congress can fix them wisely--and in a way that will not just respond to the last economic crisis or scandal but prevent the next one--I think we have to step back and carefully scrutinize how the pieces would best fit together. And that, I believe, is what our Committee is well suited to do. President Obama has declared that reforming the current financial regulatory structure will be one of his top priorities in this first year of his presidency, and I think we all welcome that. Such legislation will come out of the Senate Banking Committee, although it does touch on agencies that are regulated by other committees, such as the Finance Committee, the Agriculture Committee, and the Commerce Committee. However, I believe that this Committee's unique authority concerning governmental organization and oversight, as well as the special investigative power of our Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, requires us to get involved in this review and will enable us to help the Senate reach the right conclusions about how we restructure our system of financial governance to prevent future financial crises that can cause terrible economic pain. You may ask, how are we going to do this if the bill is not coming out of our Committee? Well, we certainly can do this first with a series of hearings and investigations; then depending on the interest and will of Committee Members, to express our conclusions in a report, which we will forward to the Banking Committee; and perhaps, if we are so moved, to offer amendments on the floor later this year when the fiscal regulation reform proposal reaches the floor. In any case, this is a matter of importance and urgency to our country, and I do believe that we have something to contribute to the Senate discussion and legislation."
"Senator Levin","Senator Burris is here, and I would like to welcome him, since it is his first hearing."
"Chairman Lieberman","Senator Levin notes that Senator Burris is here. I have to get over a bad habit where I refer to him as ``General Burris'' because we were both Attorneys General, and we love that title. But, Senator Burris, I really welcome you. I know of your work, and although you came here, shall we say, in uncertain circumstances, I know you well enough to know that you are very well qualified to be an outstanding Member of the Senate and will contribute greatly to the work of this Committee. So I am delighted that you have chosen to be on the Committee, and we welcome you here today."
"Senator Burris","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","A pleasure. Senator Collins."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS",""
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me also add my words of welcome to our newest Committee Member. I would also inform the Members of this Committee that we will be adding Members on the Republican side. I am very pleased that Senators McCain, Ensign, and Graham will be joining the Committee as well. So, once again, we will have a great complement of Members with which to do our work."
"Chairman Lieberman","And with that group, I might add, lively hearings and deliberations."
"Senator Collins","This is true, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, let me start by thanking you for holding this hearing today. I spent 5 years in State government overseeing financial regulation, so I have a great deal of interest in this area. The spiraling financial crisis has harmed virtually every American family. December's job losses were the worst monthly decline since 1945 and drove the unemployment rate above 7 percent. Individual retirement accounts and college savings accounts, as well as university endowments and public and private pension funds, have suffered huge losses. Consumer credit and mortgage availability have become more restricted. In the past year, more than one million homes have been foreclosed upon, and foreclosure proceedings are targeting two million more. Home prices are still falling, and at least 14 million households owe more on their mortgages than their homes are worth. The current crisis has its roots in the financial system, where a combination of low interest rates, reckless lending, complex new instruments, securitization of assets, poor disclosure and understanding of risks, excessive leverage, and inadequate regulation poisoned the normal flows of credit and commerce. The financial system itself has not escaped this carnage. A year ago, American capital markets were dominated by five large investment firms: Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, Merrill Lynch, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs. Now they have either failed, been sold to banks, or have converted to bank holding companies. Tens of thousands of banking and investment jobs have disappeared. A year ago, we thought a ``tarp'' was for covering your roof after a hurricane. Now the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), originally touted as a means for the Treasury Department to buy troubled assets from banks, has morphed into a mechanism for buying hundreds of billions of dollars in bank preferred stock and warrants in order to inject capital into those financial institutions. It is not sufficient for Congress to continue to infuse new money into the TARP, or simply to pass an economic stimulus package. We must also ask how to repair our system of financial regulation to minimize the risk that another crisis such as this might build up undetected and unchallenged. As we consider the options for reform, the GAO's new report on financial regulation will be a valuable guidebook. It describes the structure of the current system, explains the system's inability to cope with shifting circumstances, and proposes criteria for judging reforms. GAO sums up our challenge: ``As the Nation finds itself in the midst of one of the worst financial crises ever, it has become apparent that the regulatory system is ill-suited to meet the Nation's needs in the 21st Century.'' That judgment confirms what this Committee has found in our hearings on commodity speculation and derivatives trading; that is, there are too many gaps between jurisdictions, too many financial entities and instruments that can create huge risks but are largely free from regulatory requirements, and too little attention paid to systemic risk. We now understand that everyday activities by mortgage brokers, hedge funds, over-the-counter traders, investment banks, Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and others dealing in mortgage-backed securities, credit default swaps, and other instruments can create a crisis that affects virtually every home and business in America. Yet, of the dozen Federal agencies and hundreds of State agencies that are involved in financial regulation, it appears that not one is tasked with detecting and assessing systemic risks. We have seen the consequences of that flaw. The proliferation of unregulated and unreported credit default swaps created spider webs of commitments so that a few failures rippled into the destruction of major investment banks. By accident or by design, there are many key players in the modern regulatory system who are unregulated or lightly regulated, including mortgage brokers, self-regulating exchanges and credit-rating agencies, hedge funds, and non-bank lenders. Without additional transparency into their operations, a new systemic risk monitor would find its mission difficult to achieve. These difficulties have become so obvious that it is now common to hear government and industry officials, as well as academic experts, calling for a new systemic risk agency or monitor and for a restructuring of regulatory agencies. In November, I introduced a bill to correct two other glaring gaps in our regulatory system: The lack of explicit regulatory authority over investment bank holding companies, and the lack of transparency for credit default swaps. Regulatory reform is absolutely essential to restoring public confidence in our financial markets. I am convinced we could continue to invest billions of dollars in banks, but that if we do not put in place a new, strong regulatory system, the public's confidence, which is essential to the operation of our markets, will not be restored. America's consumers, workers, savers, and investors deserve the protection of a new regulatory system that modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and soundness requirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive risk taking, and improves oversight, accountability, and transparency. Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask unanimous consent that the remainder of my statement be introduced into the record since I realize we have only limited time this afternoon, and I could go on forever on what is one my favorite issues.\1\ Thank you. \1\ The prepared statement of Senator Collins appears in the Appendix on page 346."
"Chairman Lieberman","Needless to say, I would be interested in having you go on forever, but without objection, we will enter the statement in the record. Senator Levin is the Chairman of the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations. He has some thoughts and plans with regard to the topic of our inquiry today, and therefore, I would like to call on him on this occasion as well for an opening statement."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR LEVIN",""
"Senator Levin","Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, I would be happy to have this time deducted from my question period."
"Chairman Lieberman","Not at all."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Chairman, I thank you and the Ranking Member for holding this hearing. History has proven time and again that markets are not self-policing. The Pecora hearings before a Senate committee in the 1930s pulled back the curtain on the abuses that gave rise to the Great Depression. Hearings since then have documented a litany of abuses by financial firms trying to take advantage of investors and markets for private gain. In recent years, for example, Congressional hearings-- including by the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), which I chair--showed how Enron cooked its books, deliberately distorted energy prices, and cheated on its taxes, becoming the seventh largest corporation in the country before its collapse. Our Subcommittee hearings also showed how leading U.S. financial institutions such as Citigroup, JPMorgan, and Merrill Lynch willingly participated in deceptive transactions to help Enron inflate its earnings. Some of our other hearings of PSI have disclosed that U.S. corporations engaged in misleading accounting, offshore tax abuses, excessive stock option payments, and other disturbing practices. Our hearings in 2007 showed how a single hedge fund named Amaranth made massive commodity purchases on both regulated and unregulated energy markets to profit from distorted energy prices that they helped generate, causing U.S. consumers to pay more. Subcommittee hearings last year showed how Lehman Brothers, Morgan Stanley, and others helped offshore hedge funds dodge payment of U.S. taxes on U.S. stock dividends by facilitating complex swap agreements and stock loan transactions. Other congressional hearings have shown how Countrywide and others sold abusive mortgages, overcharged borrowers, and offloaded defective mortgage-based securities onto the market. Part of the explanation for these recent abuses is a history of actions that have gradually weakened our financial regulatory system. Here is a chart, which I guess our audience can see, but we cannot, so I will quickly read what is on it.\1\ The chart lists just a few of those actions over the last 10 years. Some of these actions are the following: \1\ The chart referenced by Senator Levin appears in the Appendix on page 356. Back in October 1998, at the request of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the Treasury Department, and the Federal Reserve, Congress blocked funding for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) regulation of over-the- counter derivatives. In 1999, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act repealed the Glass- Steagall Act of 1933, which separated banks, broker-dealers, and insurers. In December 2000, the Commodity Futures Modernization Act prohibited swaps regulation, and opened the Enron loophole allowing unregulated energy markets for large traders. In August 2003, the SEC delayed requiring auditors of private broker-dealers to register with Public Company Accounting Oversight Board rules. In June 2004, the SEC weakened the net capital rule for securities firms. In June 2006, the Court of Appeals invalidated the SEC regulation requiring hedge fund registration. We needed the SEC to come back to us and to ask for legislation. That did not happen. In December 2007, the SEC allowed foreign companies trading on U.S. exchanges to use international financial reporting standards without a reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. And these are just a few of the actions which have been taken. It hasn't been all one way, although it has mostly been one way. After the Enron scandal, we were able to enact the Sarbanes-Oxley Act that strengthened oversight of the accounting profession, required stronger financial controls, and made a number of other improvements. Last year, we successfully closed the Enron loophole which barred government oversight of electronic energy markets for large traders. There is still more reform in that area needed. But, overall, stronger market regulation has been the exception, not the rule, and had to be won despite naysayers claiming that markets work best with minimal regulation. The current crisis shows that minimal regulation is a recipe for disaster, an overhaul of Wall Street regulation is long overdue, and Congress needs to act now to fix a broken system. As Congress and the new Administration begin the work of financial restructuring and our Committee begins to examine these issues, I just want to briefly offer a few observations about needed financial reforms. The first is that Congress needs to put a cop on the beat in every financial market with authority to police every type of market participant and financial instrument to stop the abuses. We need to eliminate the statutory barriers, for example, that prohibit Federal regulation of credit default swaps, hedge funds, and derivative traders. We need to enact new limits on high-risk activities including preventing banks from running their own hedge funds and requiring the end of abusive offshore activities. Congress also needs to reduce the concentration of risk to the taxpayer by preventing any one bank from holding more than 10 percent of U.S. financial deposits, and to institute new protections to stop financial institutions from profiting from practices that abuse investors and consumers. I believe that we need to act on the substance of these abuses and to fill these gaps. Finally, Mr. Chairman, let me just add one other thought. The Chairman and Ranking Member are undertaking a very important mission, which is to look at the structure of the regulations because that is within the jurisdiction of this Committee. And I do not want to, in any way, minimize the importance of that effort. But we also need to make sure that this effort puts additional pressure on the committees that have the substantive jurisdiction to take the steps necessary to close the gaps that have been created in this system, the regulatory gaps so big that some of the greediest members of our society have been able to very easily walk through the gaps, making billions of dollars for themselves. And so, again, I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman. This is the more difficult part of the effort, the structuring part, and it is important to try to reach conclusions as to which agency is the proper agency to do the regulation. That is the who. But I believe the more urgent item, which I hope this effort will help support, is not so much the who, as important as that is; it is the whether--whether we are going to get a cop back on the beat. And this effort of our Chairman and our Ranking Member is, I know, aimed at supporting that goal because both of them have expressed and through their actions on this Committee have indicated the importance of the substantive reforms that need to be made to fill the gaps that have been created and the holes that have been gone through by too many greedy folks. And I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, and our Ranking Member, Senator Collins, for your effort. But, again, I just think we have to make sure that our effort in some way supports the critical substantive changes which both of you have spoken about, introduced legislation on, and fully support. I thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator Levin. Your statement means a lot to me. I appreciate what you have said. That is exactly what we hope to do. Your support obviously will help us to do that. I think we can, through these hearings, both learn and educate others, and then reach conclusions which can help us to be advocates for the most effective regulation of the financial sectors of our economy that we are capable of doing. I like what Senator Levin says, and if I may again go back to our earlier days as attorneys general, Senator Burris, there is a role within the chamber for advocacy among our colleagues for the most comprehensive and toughest regulation in this particular area because so much suffering has resulted from the lack of such. Thanks, Senator Levin. Let us go right to our witnesses now. First we are going to hear from Gene Dodaro, who, as I mentioned, is Acting Comptroller General. I will say for the record that Mr. Dodaro is accompanied by Richard Hillman, Managing Director of the Financial Markets and Community Investment Section of GAO; and Thomas McCool, Director of the Center for Economics, Applied Research, and Methods within GAO. Thanks for being here. Thanks for an excellent foundational report, which we ask you to testify on now."
"TESTIMONY OF EUGENE L. DODARO,\1\ ACTING COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, ACCOMPANIED BY RICHARD J. HILLMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND COMMUNITY INVESTMENT, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE, AND THOMAS MCCOOL, DIRECTOR, CENTER FOR ECONOMICS, APPLIED RESEARCH AND METHODS, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE",""
"Mr. Dodaro","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon to you, Ranking Member Senator Collins, and other Members of the Committee. We are very pleased to be here today to assist your deliberations on the financial regulatory system. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Dodaro appears in the Appendix on page 105. As was mentioned, our report was intended to provide a foundation for how the system has evolved over the last 150 years, what changes have occurred in the markets that have challenged that regulatory system and caused some of the fissures that we have seen, and to put forth a framework for helping the Congress craft and evaluate proposals in order to modernize the system. Our basic conclusion is the system is outdated, it is fragmented, and it is ill suited to meet the 21st Century challenges. Now, there are many reasons why we come to that conclusion in the report, but I will highlight three main points right now. First is that regulators have struggled and often failed to address the systemic risk of large financial conglomerates or to adequately ensure that those entities manage their own risks. Now, over the last two decades, financial conglomerates have developed through mergers and acquisitions, and they have developed and gotten into banking, securities, insurance, and a wide variety of services. And while this has occurred, basically our financial regulatory structure has remained relatively the same, set up on a functional basis. This has caused tremendous coordination problems, which are documented in some of our reports, and raises questions about the authorities and the tools available to regulators in order to address these concerns. A vivid example is the difficulty and the ultimate failure of the SEC's consolidated supervision program, which failed to address the holding company risk of many of the investment banks over this period of time. Our reports have also documented some of the challenges that the Office of Thrift Supervision had in managing such--or regulating holding companies activities of the type that AIG had conducted. The second major trend is the fact that the financial regulators have had to deal with now some of the problems that have been created by entities that have been less regulated. These include the non-bank mortgage lenders, the hedge funds, and the credit-rating agencies. For example, just to give you some significance of the size of this, in 2006, for the mortgage origination loans for subprime and non-prime entities, of those 25 institutions that made those loans, which made up about 90 percent of all loans-- it is about $543 billion in loans. Of the 25 entities, only four were not non-bank lenders. So you had a lot of activity going on that was growing over this period of time that was not subject to the same type of regulation that commercial banks were experiencing during this period of time. The third trend was the emergence of a wide variety of complex financial products, as has been referenced here in the opening statements: Collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, over-the-counter derivatives, and mortgage products that were innovative and did not have the type of disclosures that were needed. All this confused investors and others and complicated attempts to have a complete picture of this. The other conclusion that we come to is there is no one central entity that is basically charged with looking at risk across the system, and this is a major deficiency in the current structure that needs attention. Our view is that reform is urgently needed, and unless it is approached and dealt with soon, the vulnerabilities that we have all talked about this morning are going to continue to remain in the system. And that just can't be as we go forward as a country and try to stabilize the system and move forward in economic development. Our framework is intended, though, to say a couple things. One, the reform needs to be approached in a comprehensive manner so that we do not react as a country, again, in a fragmented approach. And our nine characteristics that we set out are intended to help in that regard to make sure that all critical elements are addressed. Those nine characteristics deal with a couple of very important topics. I will just highlight a few quickly. First, we believe there need to be a clear articulation of the goals of the regulatory system set in statute. That would provide consistency over time and also enable Congress to hold the regulators accountable for achieving those results. It has to be appropriately comprehensive, another characteristic. We need to close the gaps with some of the large entities that are posing risk and many of the products. We have to move to both cover the entities as well as the complexity of these financial products. It has to be systemwide. Somebody needs to be in charge of monitoring the system and focusing on the development of risk going forward. We all know where the risks are now, but they are likely to change over a period of time. So we need to close the gaps and put a process in place to monitor this on an ongoing basis. It needs to be flexible and adaptable. We need innovation to allow for capital formation, but somebody has to make determinations on what the level of risk is that is acceptable with those innovations and make some early decisions and not wait until the consequences have become so dire over time. We need to have an efficient system. There is a lot of overlap right now. The overlap can be dealt with as part of the reform. There need to be strong consumer protections. It is clear from our work and the work of others, as referenced in Senator Levin's comments and the opening statements both by the Chairman and Ranking Member, disclosures have not been adequate. There also needs to be greater attention to financial literacy efforts. We have looked at the entity that has been put in place in the Federal Government to provide that, but it has not been resourced properly, and not enough attention has been given to that particular area. We have to make sure that the regulators are independent, resourced properly to preserve that independence, and given the necessary authority to move forward. And, finally, we need to protect the taxpayers. Any risks that occur in the future should be borne by the entities being regulated and not by the taxpayer. That needs to be our goal, and we need to minimize taxpayer exposure so we do not go through again what we are currently going through across the country. This is a very important initiative. GAO is pleased to assist this Committee and stands ready to help this Committee and the Congress deal with these very important issues and decisions going forward. And my colleagues and I would be happy to answer any of your questions at the appropriate time this afternoon. So thank you very much."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Mr. Dodaro. That is a very good beginning for us. We are grateful that Professor Howell Jackson from Harvard is here, and we are also grateful that President Obama and the new Administration are not taking everybody from the Harvard Law School faculty. In fact, if I am correct, the President's nomination of Dean Elena Kagan to be Solicitor General has moved you now to be the Acting Dean of the Law School. Is that right?"
"Mr. Jackson","That is true."
"Chairman Lieberman","If so, I congratulate you and wish you well. Thanks for your testimony. We will hear it now."
"TESTIMONY OF HOWELL E. JACKSON,\1\ JAMES S. REID JR. PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL",""
"Mr. Jackson","Thank you very much. It is a pleasure to be here, Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins. I am delighted to have a chance to participate in this hearing and begin the process, I hope, of genuine and serious regulatory reform in this country, which is long overdue. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Jackson appears in the Appendix on page 133. Let me begin by just commending Government Accountability Office for its fine report. I think it does an excellent job both pulling together its prior work on the subject and also laying out the major weaknesses in our regulatory structure. And I agree with almost everything that is in the report. The regulatory gaps that exist have created serious problems for our economy. There is a serious mismatch between our regulatory structure and the 21st Century financial services industry, particularly to the extent that financial conglomerates dominate and are able to play off different regulatory agencies against each other and find this unregulated space to expand products. I think that one of the things the report highlights in passing that is important to recognize is the world has really moved ahead of us in the area of regulatory reform. If you go around the major countries and look at the legislation that they have been adopting over the past 5 to 10 years, it has all been a movement towards consolidated supervision that puts us at a serious disadvantage. We have the anomalous situation in this country of having the world's most expensive regulatory structure in both absolute terms and relative terms, but one that has failed to provide us the kind of protections that we need. So this Committee's agenda is very much in need of setting an agenda for the whole Congress. What I thought I would do is comment upon five areas in which I thought it would be useful to discuss some of the ramifications of the GAO study in areas where I think the weaknesses are particularly important for this Committee to note. The first has been touched upon, and I just want to talk about it a little bit more, which is the absence of a market stability regulator, something that Senator Collins mentioned, and it is certainly the case that this is a problem. The Federal Reserve Board was set up to be our market stability regulator in a time when systemic risks were thought to lie solely with depository institutions, with banks, and having a lender of last resort function, oversight of bank holding companies, and member banks was thought to be an act of protection, and I think in the middle of the 20th Century that was the case. Since the middle of the 20th Century, the role of depository institutions has declined. Other sectors, most notably capital market sectors, have expanded dramatically. And it is not surprising today that when we look to see where the system risks came from, they came from other sectors of the economy. They came from the investment banking sector; they came from the over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives area; they came from innovations in mortgage lending--all things that were not contemplated in the past. And so we need to have a regulator of market stability that can see all potential sources of regulatory risk, including insurance companies and other areas of the economy. I think that it is appropriate to think of the Federal Reserve Board as the candidate for having that expanded power, and I know today is not the day to talk about the exact structure of regulatory reform. But I would just point out five areas of weakness with the current oversight of market stability. One is the cramped jurisdiction that the Federal Reserve Board has, now limited to a certain number of areas, not including insurance companies, not including many other areas of importance systemic risk. Another problem is the manner in which the lender of last resort powers are structured. It has been remarked by many people that the Federal Reserve Board had to operate at the boundaries of its powers. Now, I think it acted legally, but it was constrained in how it provided liquidity in the past 6 months. I think that is something that needs to be clarified in regulatory reform. I think, as was just alluded to by Mr. Dodaro, the mechanisms for ensuring that the costs of systemic risk are borne by the sectors of the industry that generate those problems is an important weakness of our current structure. The systemic intervention powers of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) are charged back to the banking sector if they are used. The TARP has an aspirational provision for recouping some funds, but we need to have a comprehensive approach to recouping funds to make sure that the incentives are right in the financial services industry, that they will bear the cost of systemic risk when they arise. I think it is also important to recognize that the Federal Reserve Board needs to expand its expertise to go beyond the traditional areas of jurisdiction. The crisis with AIG and the investment banks show that it needs to have broader expertise and greater personnel skills in many areas that are not traditionally supervised. Whether you want the Federal Reserve to be a comprehensive supervisor I think is a difficult question of regulatory design, but I think if it is going to be the market stability regulator, it has got to expand its knowledge in certain areas. There may well be things that the Federal Reserve currently does that it does not need to do in the future that should be reassigned to other places. But if we are going to have an effective market stability regulator, we need to think more broadly about the powers of the Federal Reserve. Finally, it is important to recognize that many of the solutions to systemic risk and market stability need to be done on the front end. The regulation of clearing and settlement systems, limitations on investments, problems generated by the number of investments in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac securities--these are all ordinary supervisory issues, and we need to have a mechanism where the market stability regulator can speak to the front-line regulators and, in my view, have a veto or an override if it thinks those other regulators are not addressing market stability issues. It is a weakness in the structure that the Federal Reserve comes in after the fact, not in front, and it is inevitably more costly to correct things after the fact, and that is a weakness. Let me go on to just mention a couple of other areas of weakness that I think it is worthwhile for this Committee to focus on, and the second one that I want to mention is actually Congress' role in the current difficulties, or at least the statutory structure that Congress has helped create. We have a regulatory system that has lots of legalistic divisions in regulatory authority, where the boundaries are written in very cramped ways, every regulator has its jurisdiction, and each regulator is jealously guarding its jurisdiction against other regulators. That leads to a situation where the industry can play regulators off against each other and exploit regulatory loopholes, and the regulators are inherently at a disadvantage. One of the items on Senator Levin's list was the failure of the SEC to oversee hedge funds. That was a decision by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia based on an interpretation of statute. Now, I don't agree with the interpretation of the court in that case, but it was a problem for the SEC that it had no jurisdictional authority. One of the things that we need to do in regulatory reform is to create broad jurisdictional mandates so that the regulators have the power to go into areas and do what needs to be done rather than having cramped constraints. The division of regulatory authority is also totally clear in the problems of the mortgage banking industry. If you look at the regulatory structure that we have created in this country, the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) had a piece of consumer protection for mortgage loans. The Federal Reserve Board was responsible for subprime loans. There were at least five Federal agencies in charge of depository institutions that were making the loans. The SEC was responsible for the securitization process in the credit-rating agencies. State regulators had some powers over mortgage brokerage transactions. And actually just this last summer, we created a new licensing process for mortgage brokers. It is no surprise that in a regulatory structure that is so fragmented no one saw the homeownership problem arising, and that there is no single agency to point to for responsibility after the fact. Another area that has been alluded to already this afternoon but I would like to mention is the problem of regulatory expertise and competence. This is, I think, most apparent if one looks around the world and sees what happens when other regulatory agencies are consolidated together. And one of the things that happen is the quality of personnel that is willing to work in the regulatory agencies goes up. Professionally, it is a broader mandate. There are more professional experiences. There are fewer positions that are taken by political appointees. It is a more attractive career position that attracts higher-quality personnel when we have a broader mandate. I think it is also the case to recognize that when you have a narrow regulatory function, it is hard to have expertise in every area. So the failure of Bear Stearns actually is a pretty good example of this because when the investment bank was getting into trouble, the SEC had to look to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to get the personnel it needed to understand the problems. The Federal Reserve Board has a large number of economists that study banking issues in great detail, but the SEC has never had that kind of expertise, and it has lacked the bench strength to address many of the problems before it. So we have a mismatch of personnel. We have an inability to move personnel from one sector to the other, which seriously constrains us in terms of risk and is a weakness of our system. Another weakness of the fragmented system is the vulnerability of specialized regulatory agencies to the problem of regulatory capture. If you are an agency and you just regulate one sector of the financial services industry or one subsector, you are much more likely to identify with the success of your constituent institutions. So I would say the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, in order to make the national charters more attractive, cavalierly preempted State law of consumer protection, to the great detriment of the consumers of the regulated banks, and also making the task of State regulators much more complicated as Federal entities were coming in with preemption and State entities were being subject to full regulatory structure. I think there are many reasons one can explain that, but part of the reason was the agencies much too much identified with their constituents rather than thinking about what was in the best interest of the economy and the general public. I think in the area of consumer protection, this has already been touched upon, but to the extent this Committee is looking at shortcomings of consumer protection, I think the fragmented regulatory structure is also a source of concern here. There are lots of functionally similar products that are regulated in different ways because different regulatory agencies have expertise over them. If you are a clever attorney, you can make an insurance product look like a securities product or a banking product look like an insurance product or an insurance product look like a securities product and get a different regulatory structure. And there are many examples of repositioning to take advantage of marginal differences in regulation. That confuses the consumer, and it creates inconsistent protections across the financial services industry. In the area of financial education, which I think is tremendously important, in the end we depend on consumers to understand the products, and we need to have those consumers be educated. There is ample academic evidence that shows that less educated consumers make poor choices, take worse mortgages, have worse credit card terms. So financial literacy is a major goal, but it cannot be done on a piecemeal basis. We cannot have 200 different agencies engaging in financial education. It needs to be a centralized function. It needs to be a function that attacks the problem of financial literacy in a comprehensive way. It needs to interact with the educational system. That needs to be centralized, and fragmented financial education really is no financial education. The final point of weakness that I want to mention is also covered in the GAO report, but it is just worth noting. We live in an increasingly globalized financial market, and a major task of financial regulators is to interact globally, to work with regulators overseas. And there are a variety of reasons for this. Among other things, we need to make sure that transactions are not just escaping overseas and obtaining lower regulation in other jurisdictions, but there is cooperation that needs to be done in terms of enforcement actions, memoranda of understanding, and working out consistent regulatory systems. Our fragmented regulatory system is poorly suited for this task, having multiple entities going overseas to interact with unified regulators in other countries. When you are overseas, it is a common complaint about the United States that you cannot talk to one person, you have to talk to a dozen people. There are monthly visits by different regulators from the United States to London, to Tokyo, to Hong Kong, and it is an ineffective and inappropriate system. In many areas, such as in the banking area, we have multiple regulators representing the United States on the same issues. That complicates negotiations, makes it more difficult to work with our allies, and is a serious impediment to effective regulation. So I think the interactions on the international side are a separate area of concern that one should look for. I should say in this area, since it is in the Committee's mandate, there is a lot of expertise internationally on how to do regulatory reform. Many other jurisdictions have gone through the process, and I think particularly the British model is one to look at for some very interesting examples of structuring the reform, which very much needs to be done. Let me just close by saying the current financial situation is a challenge on multiple levels for this country, and for the most part our task is regaining our economic strength and trying to restore lost value to the people of this country. The one silver lining to the current crisis is it gives us an opportunity to reform our regulatory structure. That is something that has long been overdue. It has been a difficult political task to take on. But we finally have the opportunity to address a problem of a major sort for the United States, and I hope this Committee will take leadership in addressing that concern. Thank you very much."
"Chairman Lieberman","Very well said. Thank you. Professor Steven Davidoff is on the faculty of the University of Connecticut School of Law. I think I overheard you say you had been at Michigan before."
"Mr. Davidoff","Wayne State University Law School."
"Chairman Lieberman","Wayne State, so you claim you do not have any connection with the State of Maine?"
"Mr. Davidoff","No. But I have been there many times, and it is a lovely place."
"Senator Levin","And you apparently still have a place in Ann Arbor?"
"Mr. Davidoff","Sadly, I have a house in Ann Arbor that I am unable to sell."
"Chairman Lieberman","Senator Levin raised this subject."
"Mr. Davidoff","It is not Senator Levin's fault."
"Senator Levin","I did not know that part or else I would not have gotten into it. But Wayne State University Law School, if I could say, Mr. Chairman, is the law school where my wife graduated. She is a lawyer."
"Chairman Lieberman","Well, that speaks for the quality of the law school."
"Mr. Davidoff","It is the true public law school of Michigan."
"Chairman Lieberman","Senator Levin is known for his constituent service, and I am sure he will do anything he can to help you sell your house in Ann Arbor."
"Mr. Davidoff","I like my house. Ann Arbor is a lovely place."
"Chairman Lieberman","With all of that, Mr. Davidoff, I am proud that our staff search for experts in this happily led us to somebody who is now at the University of Connecticut Law School. Please proceed."
"TESTIMONY OF STEVEN M. DAVIDOFF,\1\ PROFESSOR OF LAW, UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCHOOL OF LAW",""
"Mr. Davidoff","Thank you. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Minority Member Collins, and other Members of this Senate Committee, I want to start by thanking you for providing me an opportunity to testify today. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Davidoff appears in the Appendix on page 143. I would like to start by agreeing with the uniform sentiment expressed today that today's financial regulatory architecture is fractured, archaic, and ill suited to today's modern financial world. What I would like to do in my testimony is fill out the excellent GAO report by providing a short narrative of the deficits of the past few years, which aptly illustrates the failures of the regulatory system and its current fractured nature. I want to start with the root causes of the financial crisis. The causes of the current financial crisis are still the subject of much study and debate, and will remain so long after Congress acts on any financial reform. Nonetheless, at this point, 18 months into the crisis, we have a rough sketch. In summary, historically low interest rates led to excessive borrowing by both individuals and financial institutions. The consequence was the rapid rise of housing prices. These prices were increased by demand from so-called subprime borrowers. During the period from 2000 through 2006, the amount of outstanding subprime mortgage debt grew an astounding 801 percent to $732 trillion. These loans were often issued and underwritten under the assumption that ``housing prices do not fall.'' The assumption proved all too incorrect. And it is now all too clear that in many instances borrowers were placed into loans that they cannot now afford. Theoretically, bankers should have been more concerned with whether their loans would be repaid. However, the traditional ``It's a Wonderful Life'' banking model where lenders and borrowers passed each other on the street and lenders personally assessed the creditworthiness of their clients has long past. Mortgages are now securitized into asset-backed facilities called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs), and sold into the market. Lenders now serve as intermediaries in this ``originate to distribute'' model and are more concerned with the ability to sell these loans rather than whether they are repaid. Many of these lenders, particularly for subprime mortgages, were non-bank lenders subject to differing oversight and regulation than their bank counterparts. It is now clear that this new securitization process allowed for lax lending standards. In 2005, the SEC contributed to this by liberalizing the registration process for these securities. At that time, the SEC discarded the obligation of underwriters of CDOs to perform due diligence on these CDOs to confirm adequate loan documentation. In essence, for those CDOs that were registered, the SEC relied upon private underwriters to uphold standards. Here, the underwriters also procured a private ratings agency to rate the CDO's tranches. Notably, though, the SEC, due to regulatory restrictions, was only responsible for regulating affirmative disclosure in the securitization process when the underwriter chose to register the securities. In no instances, as Professor Jackson highlighted, was the SEC responsible for the mortgage origination process or disclosure. In fact, financial disclosure, again as Professor Jackson highlighted, is subject to multiple regulatory agencies, none of which have the primary goal of consumer financial disclosure. In addition, under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, the SEC was affirmatively denied the ability to regulate the procedures and methodologies by which any rating agency determines credit ratings. In hindsight, the SEC and other financial regulatory agencies lacked complete oversight over the mortgage securitization market, and it was a market that was, at best, subject to overlapping and conflicting regulation. This allowed market failure as lenders, rating agencies, and borrowers all contributed to lax borrowing standards and the taking of excess risk, the consequences of which we are now dealing with now. During the period from August 2007 through March 2008, banks rushed to recapitalize their balance sheets from private investors. Nonetheless, the week of March 11, 2008, Bear Stearns collapsed. In hindsight, the largely unregulated investment banking model was overly susceptible to shock. Unlike bank holding companies, investment banks historically had a leverage model ranging from 20:1 to 30:1 and relied on short-term, highly movable deposits for liquidity. These deposits came from hedge funds, for the most part-- sophisticated financial institutions that could quickly move their assets in the case of a crisis, and this is what they did, leading Bear Stearns to lose liquidity and into a forced sale. The fall of Lehman Brothers was due to similar factors. At the time, there was a significant outcry that the failing of Lehman and perhaps Bear Stearns was due to shorting of their stock in the market and the crisis in confidence it created. In some cases, it has led to cries for regulation of the credit default market and a prohibition on shorting. Credit default swaps (CDSs), notably, were deliberately legislated to be left unregulated by Congress in the inaptly named Commodity Futures Modernization Act. The veracity of these claims about shorting and CDSs is unknown at this point. But, in fact, due to the lack of information about trading in the CDS market, I doubt anyone will ever be able to definitively conclude one way or the other on this point. The full role of derivatives generally in the financial crisis still appears uncertain. Certainly in some circumstances, derivatives increased risk, heightening the impact of the rapid decline of the CDO market. More certainly, AIG was brought down because of underwriting of credit default swaps out of a London-based subsidiary. AIG was able to leverage a regulatory gap. It was regulated by the Office of Thrift Supervision as a savings and loan holding company because of AIG's control of a thrift, but AIG was not subject under this regulation to the same scrutiny or heightened requirement it otherwise would have been subject to had it been a bank holding company. Furthermore, the Inspector General of the SEC issued on September 25, 2008, a report on the SEC's now defunct voluntary regulation program of the five investment banks, the voluntary Consolidated Supervised Entity (CSE) program. The program was doomed to fail and understaffed from the start. Three SEC employees were assigned to monitor each bank with tens of thousands of employees. The SEC never conducted appropriate, in-depth inspections as to risk measurement, capital liquidity sources, and other disclosure for these investment banks. This was true even after Bear Stearns fell. The investment banks were able to leverage a regulatory gap to avoid in-depth scrutiny of their leveraging and risk processes and be regulated to the same level as bank holding companies are. I want to spend the next few minutes just talking about the government response to the financial crisis and, again, how it illustrates the fractured nature of today's regulation and regulators. Initially deprived of statutory ability to fully address the crisis, the government would engage in what Professor David Zaring and I call ``regulation by deal'' in order to attempt to salvage the financial system. In a series of transactions, the government nationalized Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, bailed out AIG, and arranged for the sale of Wachovia and the banking deposits of Washington Mutual. Then with the passage of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the adoption of the TARP program, the Treasury Department agreed to invest--or force financial institutions to invest, depending upon who you speak to--$125 billion in the country's nine largest financial institutions. Since that time the government has been administering the TARP; along the way the bailout of AIG has been reworked, Citi and Bank of America have received a second set of TARP funds-- $90 billion in total--and General Motors (GM) and Chrysler have also received TARP funds under the automotive component of TARP. Meanwhile, just today Treasury Secretary nominee, Timothy Geithner, part of the prior team, announced his desire to rework the entire program. Each of these deals has been on different terms and structured seemingly on an ad hoc basis, without any organization or systematic approach. From news reports in the Wall Street Journal and other sources, it appears that the coordination of the FDIC, Treasury, and Federal Reserve on these individual bailouts was sometimes strained by disagreement over each of their regulators' role and statutory capacity. This may have contributed to the ad hoc nature of the government's response. The statutory limitations on these agencies, as Professor Jackson alluded to, and the lack of an in-place lender of last resort also affected the regulators' ability to fully respond to the financial crisis. I note that the perceived cure to a panic and general credit freeze is to restore confidence in the markets. This has at times been sorely lacking among the populace due to the regulators' perceived ad hoc response to the financial crisis. In conclusion, this brings us to today. I do not have time in my testimony to recommend solutions, but Congress will clearly hear many, and I offer some in my written testimony. Here I want to conclude by answering the question posed by this hearing: Where were the watchdogs? Well, in part, as you can see from my sad narrative, the regulators were hobbled by their deregulatory bent and limited, fractured, and overlapping jurisdiction which left wide parts of the financial system without oversight or regulation. Thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Professor Davidoff. That was an excellent narrative, really an excellent summary of how we got to where we are. I must say that insofar as I expressed in my opening statement our intention and hope that in these hearings we would learn, so we could help to educate, and then advocate effectively, I think all three of you have been excellent educators of the Committee, and I thank you for it. We will have 7-minute rounds of questions. I will begin now. A clear conclusion that you all share--and it begins with the excellent GAO report--is that the current system for regulating financial institutions in our country is fractured, out of date, and just not able to deal with today's complicated and immense global financial networks that do business here in the United States. I was thinking as you were testifying that we have all become over the last year or so familiar with a term that I had not heard before, which is that an entity can be ``too big to fail.'' Right? And so we end up spending or extending billions of dollars either of direct aid or credit. From what you are saying, it sounds like it may not be that these entities are too big to regulate, but they are certainly too big and complicated for our current regulatory system to oversee in the public interest. And that is a big part of the problem. I take it, just to start with the baseline question, that it is reasonable to conclude, both from the report and the testimony, that none of you thinks that simply fixing some of the specific authorities of existing regulatory agencies is enough to prevent the next regulatory crisis without a larger, comprehensive reform. Mr. Dodaro."
"Mr. Dodaro","Certainly there are some parts of the current regulatory structure that you may want to look at."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right. Sure."
"Mr. Dodaro","But we do not think that you can adequately address this problem in a comprehensive manner without making broader changes. Now, on the point that you mentioned about some of the sizes of the entities and them being too big to fail, questions have to be asked about the extent of whether or not they are too big to manage effectively."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Dodaro","One of the really important themes, I believe, that runs through a lot of this issue is the whole question of risk management approaches and models, risk management at the individual institution level, at the industry level, at our national U.S. level, and at a global level. And I think that issue really needs a lot of attention from a regulatory standpoint, but also a corporate governance standpoint."
"Chairman Lieberman","I was wondering whether you were suggesting that there ought to be some governmental regulatory mechanism that may say to a financial entity this next acquisition you have in mind or the next product line you are putting out is too much. In some sense, it sounds like a classic antitrust function. It is a little bit different, of course. But what would you say to that?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Well, I would say you need some checks and balances in the system. Ultimately, the company's management and the board of directors are responsible, but there has to be a threshold of risk as to whether or not the regulators are adequately achieving the goals that would be set up with the new system and protecting investors and taxpayers, in particular. So this whole question of how to achieve the proper balance between regulating and allowing innovation, I think, is really going to be the tough underlying issue that really needs to be addressed, because there is a tendency to overregulate and have things roll back over time. Neither one of those is really the optimum solution. So, our characteristics are intended to try to get to see what can happen with that balance. We also point out that there needs to be an adequate transition period in terms of whatever change, but also, Mr. Chairman, I would say the really other important part of this is diligent oversight on a continual basis by the Congress. The likelihood that this is going to be solved with one big stroke is really----"
"Chairman Lieberman","One big move, understood. That is always a danger here. We legislate, we reform, and then we walk away."
"Mr. Dodaro","Because things change, markets are going to be fluid, and there needs to be some built-in oversight on a regular basis."
"Chairman Lieberman","Professor Jackson, you made some interesting statements about the possibilities of expanding the authorities and powers and jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Board. Given your druthers, would that be at the heart of your comprehensive reform? And if so, would you blend or have the Federal Reserve absorb some of the existing Federal financial regulatory agencies?"
"Mr. Jackson","Senator, that is a good question, and certainly one model that one could think about is to say the Federal Reserve is at the heart of the system with the best expertise, and we will fold everything in or a lot of things in to make a super agency. That is not personally what I would favor. I think that the amount of centralization of authority is antithetical to a lot of American traditions. And, more importantly, I think what you want is a focused regulator with specific tasks. So I would prefer a model of the Federal Reserve Board having broader powers for market stability issues to sort of have a roving mandate throughout the system, but another counterweight Federal agency with consolidated supervision that would be responsible for the front-line authority."
"Chairman Lieberman","So create a new agency that would take in some of the existing agencies."
"Mr. Jackson","Yes, consolidated in the new agency. It would have front-line supervision, and all the consumer protections in day-to-day activities and have the Federal Reserve Board as an expanded oversight entity that does the market stability functions and with the lender of last resort capacity to come in should the need arise."
"Chairman Lieberman","Interesting."
"Mr. Jackson","It is a little bit like the British model, except I would envision a more robust role for the Federal Reserve than the Bank of England has."
"Chairman Lieberman","Got it. Professor Davidoff, I have about a minute left in my time. Why don't you get into this discussion. What would be your druthers if you were redesigning the system?"
"Mr. Davidoff","If I were redesigning the system, I would look at it analytically as three lines: One as systemic risk regulator; second, a consumer protection agency, which is the SEC and CFTC, which would have enhanced regulation over financial disclosure, and third, consumer financial disclosure."
"Chairman Lieberman","You would put them together?"
"Mr. Davidoff","I would have two separate agencies. I would put the CFTC and SEC together."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is what I meant."
"Mr. Davidoff","It creates opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. There is really no good reason to have them separate anymore. Some people argue they should be competitors, they are models, but we have ample models and competitors abroad globally that can regulate them. I think there is a third type of regulator, which Professor Jackson alluded to, which is your capital regulator, which is your FDIC or the Office of the Comptroller of the Currancy (OCC). And so there are really three lines: Your lender of last resort systemic regulator, then capital regulator----"
"Chairman Lieberman","Which would be the Federal Reserve."
"Mr. Davidoff","Well, you can place them wherever you want."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes."
"Mr. Davidoff","And I think Professor Jackson makes a good point, which is the Federal Reserve is naturally cited as the lender of last resort, but it is a unique independent agency. And perhaps the capital requirements should be elsewhere with Federal Reserve input because we want congressional oversight. And this is why it is good that your Committee is having this hearing because it is really a structural issue. Congress should not be legislating the nuances, or else you are going to get into a battle of the experts in deciding things. You should set up a regulatory apparatus and let those regulators fill it all in."
"Chairman Lieberman","Great. Thank you. Senator Collins."
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me take up where you left off. As I look at this issue, it is clear that we have a gap because there is no one who is responsible for assessing systemic risk, what Professor Jackson called the ``market stability regulator.'' So that is a problem. And it is interesting. A few years ago, the House actually rejected regulatory authority over Freddie and Fannie that would have allowed regulation for systemic risk. When I look back on that with the benefit of hindsight, it is just extraordinary that the amendment was defeated so handily in the House. But then there is also what I call the safety and soundness regulators from my experience at the State level. We would not allow a State-chartered bank or credit union to have a leverage ratio of 30:1 that Bear Stearns did. That is just inconceivable. So you need that safety and soundness regulator to be extended so that a large investment bank has to meet the same kind of capital requirements and undergoes the same kind of audits and reviews as the local credit union--whose failure would be far less devastating for the economy. And then the third issue to me is who ensures that new, exotic financial instruments like credit default swaps do not fall through the regulatory gaps. To me, credit default swaps are an insurance product, and yet they were not regulated as insurance. They also were not regulated as securities. So help me sort through who should do what, and I am going to start with you, Professor Jackson, because you started down that road when you said the Federal Reserve Board should have the systemic risk authority."
"Mr. Jackson","Right. Well, I do think this would fall into the second heading of my discussions, I think, in terms of thinking about how you are defining jurisdiction. This is a lawyer's task, writing the jurisdiction of agencies, and it can be done in a lot of different ways. We have tended to take a narrow focus, so the SEC has authority over securities. It is a defined term. The Supreme Court has decided I think maybe 15 cases at this point about what that term means. There was litigation about whether swaps were securities in the 1980s and 1990s, and they were determined to fall outside of the SEC's mandate for the most part, and Congress did not reverse it. It sort of validated that decision. So I think that whether it is the SEC or a consolidated supervisor, one should define the jurisdiction broadly, and so, for example, you could define the jurisdiction to be over products that are financial in nature. That is a definition we use in some areas, which is an open-ended definition that gives the agency authority to say if a new product comes along, that is financial, and we are going to exert some sort of jurisdiction. To pick up on a question that Senator Lieberman put forward, I do think that the agencies have to have the power, if a new product comes along, to say this is financial and you just cannot sell it willy-nilly any way you want. You can sell it but it has got to be, for example, on an exchange with a clearing and settlement system that we can keep track of, so we know the transparency, so we know counterparty risk. And that does mean saying you cannot just go to London and do it on Fleet Street any way you want because we recognize that increases risk. So I think the regulators have got to have the self- confidence and the support to say certain products are too risky. For too long we have said, well, as long as it is institutional investors, we do not need to worry, they can fend for themselves. The lesson of the last year is when institutional investors get into trouble, sometimes they drag the rest of us down, and we need to have just a different philosophy that sometimes means saying no."
"Senator Collins","Professor Davidoff."
"Mr. Davidoff","I agree with that sentiment. If you do not have regulators with broad jurisdictional authority, you will have Ph.D.'s on Wall Street who will structure products to fill that black hole. And so you need regulators with broad authority, and you need it over the entire financial system. Credit default swaps are a perfect example. They are traded over the counter. We have no idea who the parties are. They should be traded on an exchange, or a regulator should look at them to see if they should be traded on an exchange. But we have to regulate forward, not backward. We do not know what the next crisis is going to be. So we need to have regulators that have full jurisdictional scope."
"Senator Collins","Should we have safety and soundness regulation for entities like the Bear Stearnses of the world?"
"Mr. Davidoff","Absolutely. I mean, the investment banks, the only reason the CSE program existed was because the investment banks needed a regulator under an EU directive."
"Senator Collins","But that was a voluntary program."
"Mr. Davidoff","Right, it was a voluntary program that they were trying to get out of direct oversight from the European Union, and they existed in this netherworld of unregulated jurisdiction. Now, the elephant in the room, which we have alluded to, is insurance. It is regulated by the States. It is a big problem, how we capture those products, because if we regulate all securities, if we have oversight of hedge funds--and here I am talking about oversight, not necessarily regulation--the regulator should have the power to regulate. But that should be done through the regulatory process. But if we leave, for example, insurance out of the mix, what do we do then?"
"Senator Collins","Mr. Dodaro, who should be the regulator for what? Who should be the systemic risk regulator? Should safety and soundness regulation by front-line regulators be extended to all financial entities that could possibly pose hazards to the economy?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Our report at this juncture does not make specific recommendations, but the points that you are probing on go to a couple of the characteristics that we have. One is the systemwide risk proponent that would look across the system and look for systemic issues. I think also, Senator Collins, that ensuring that regulation is comprehensive, is one of the characteristics that is meant to close the gaps with entities and products. Then the third component that we point out has to do with flexibility and adaptability, and I completely agree with my colleagues at the witness table here that we need a proactive approach and not a reactive approach. And I think that is where you are headed with your question, and I quite agree with that, whoever that person is who is charged. But it also goes back to our first objective and characteristic in our framework, which is to set clear regulatory goals and mandates and charter and give the regulators the broad authority, then hold them accountable for doing it."
"Senator Collins","Thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Senator Collins."
"Senator Levin",""
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me do something which really is not the direct purpose of the hearing, but something that I want to do to take advantage of your expertise while you are here. It is obvious from your answers that you do have some opinions on not just who should do the regulation, but whether certain activities ought to be regulated. I do not know whether, Mr. Dodaro, you are going to want to or be able to comment, but let me start with our other two witnesses. First, should hedge funds be regulated? Professor Jackson."
"Mr. Jackson","Yes"
"Senator Levin","Professor Davidoff."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Are they currently regulated?"
"Mr. Jackson","I would say inadequately. I think this is a good example that the SEC had an initiative to bring the advisers under their jurisdiction. Whether that is strong enough for all aspects of their activities, I am not sure. But that was certainly an important first step. I think beyond thinking about the hedge funds as entities, it is the products--the credit default swaps, the OTC products--that need to be brought into what I think would look more like a futures regulation standard. I would say here that I think this is just an excellent area to rethink how we got into the current situation of the CFTC and the SEC being in competition for business and trying to attract entities by giving exemptions that play to our disadvantage over the long run."
"Senator Levin","I will get to the specifics of the hedge funds."
"Mr. Davidoff","Can I just add something on the hedge funds?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Davidoff","I think if you ask someone, if you ask a regulator what role did hedge funds play in the current financial crisis, I think he would look at you like a deer in the headlights because we just do not know. And one of the things that we need--and even the hedge fund managers who testified about a month ago agree--is an oversight process for hedge funds, and we need a disclosure process. It may need to be confidential. But there are also systemic risks of unregulated capital pools that any systemic risk regulator will have to look at. Even the Harvard Endowment is in some terms a hedge fund, and we need to bring those capital pools under some oversight, or else the next systemic risk will rise there. And it happened in Long Term Capital Management. It could happen again."
"Senator Levin","Let me move to the credit default swaps. We have had a lot of discussion about that. The SEC Chairman, Christopher Cox, back in October asked for jurisdiction over those credit default swaps. Professor Jackson, should they be regulated?"
"Mr. Jackson","Yes. I think that Mr. Cox's proposal was a good one, albeit a piecemeal response, but that would be an incremental improvement, his recommendation."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Davidoff."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes, I think they should be moved to an open exchange."
"Senator Levin","Where they would be regulated."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes, where they would be regulated. That way we can see the pricing, and the price discovery mechanism can work. And if credit default swaps are going up on an entity, we can see it instead of an opaque process."
"Senator Levin","Senator Collins has, I believe--or last session, at least--introduced a bill on this, and I fully support that effort. But the bottom line is the two of you believe that Congress should eliminate the barriers to the regulation of credit default swaps."
"Mr. Jackson","Yes."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes."
"Senator Levin","By the way, Mr. Dodaro, if you have a feeling of any of this, if this is within your ambit, just jump in anytime."
"Mr. Dodaro","Well, I will get caught up quickly. First, on all of these areas, our belief is you definitely need more transparency. I agree with my other witnesses that whoever the systemic risk regulator is should have some jurisdiction over these issues. And, Senator, I would point out that we have raised concerns about some of these derivative products dating back as far as 1994. GAO encourages that some of the regulators have oversight over these derivative products."
"Senator Levin","All right. I want to keep going down a rat- a-tat-tat list here, if I can, because I think this is important while we have your expertise here. Now, we were talking about credit default swaps. What about Federal regulation of all types of swaps, including interest rate, equity, and foreign currency swaps? Same answer or different answer? Professor Jackson."
"Mr. Jackson","Well, I think that you need to look at some of these products on a case-by-case basis, but I think that you need to have a single financial authority who is making a decision about the best way to approach these instruments. In some cases, it may not be necessary to go to exchange-based regulation. One may want to do it by regulating the entities that engage in the transactions. But I do not think we should have an artificial boundary or a competition between agencies around these instruments. I think they should be fully within the financial sector and an expert agency should have the jurisdiction."
"Senator Levin","There ought to be jurisdiction in an agency to regulate."
"Mr. Jackson","To regulate."
"Senator Levin","Fair enough. Professor Davidoff."
"Mr. Davidoff","Absolutely you need the ability."
"Senator Levin","All right. And the authority in an agency to regulate."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Now, what about over-the-counter market derivatives?"
"Mr. Jackson","I would give the same answer to that."
"Senator Levin","Same answer, Professor Davidoff, or different?"
"Mr. Davidoff","The same answer. You need jurisdiction over everything."
"Senator Levin","Capital reserve requirements on banks and security firms--should Congress require regulators to impose stronger capital reserve requirements? Should we just simply authorize them to do it?"
"Mr. Jackson","I think that Congress needs to be careful not to be too specific in its dictates, only that if you are too specific the industry will work around it. I think that comprehensive capital requirements are important, and it needs to be done not just at banks and insurance companies, but it needs to be done for conglomerates as well, including the entities that we do not have traditional names for. So I think one needs to be careful about specifying sector regulations as opposed to saying we need to have a comprehensive oversight of solvency and liquidity."
"Senator Levin","Authorize an agency to do that."
"Mr. Jackson","Authorize an agency, and then----"
"Senator Levin","That is fine. That is in keeping with your previous answer, essentially."
"Mr. Jackson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Professor Davidoff. I know this may sound obvious to you, but let me tell you, we have to build up a record if we are going to move quickly on this thing. I think all of us want to get to the structural issues, and again, I commend our Chairman and Ranking Member. This is a tough job to do that. It is a harder job in a lot of ways because it is more technical. It does not have the glamour of some of these other issues, so-called."
"Senator Burris","It does not have the sex appeal."
"Senator Levin","Sex appeal, there you go. It is essential that it be done, but we cannot let that effort stop us from doing things we have to move very quickly on. So that is why I wanted this record to----"
"Mr. Davidoff","Can I just add one more thing here----"
"Senator Levin","Of course. Mr. Davidoff . To your very good point, which is Congress should use its political capital to set up a structure, and they should not get bogged down in the details. Sometimes they should, but bank capital requirements is a fight that Congress does not need to pick. They can have the regulator have the authority and give them the authority to set it."
"Senator Levin","But it is clear that we ought to act to give the regulators those kinds of authorities?"
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes."
"Senator Levin","My time is up. I have some additional questions, Mr. Chairman, for the record along the same line, and I very much appreciate the patience of our witnesses because this is really slightly different than what they were called to testify on, which is very valuable testimony. But I want to thank you for your testimony."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator Levin. I agree with you. To go back to a metaphor you used in your opening statement, which is used a lot but it is very relevant here, and your last series of questions made the point, which is: There are a lot of financial beats in America today that do not have a cop on them, and that is part of the reason why we are in the mess we are in now. The second thing is that the public gets this, and they are really infuriated, and it does create a political moment in which we can achieve the kind of comprehensive, proactive reform in regulation of financial entities for which you have all in one way or another called. So, obviously, at some political moments you can overreact. This happens to be a political moment, I think, where the public wants us to do, in fact, what we should do. And you are testifying from a very non-political point of view that is exactly the case."
"Senator Levin","If I could just interrupt for one more second. We had the SEC months ago asking us for authority to regulate credit default swaps."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Now, it should not take much, as far as I am concerned, to do that little piece as quickly as we can. We are talking--I do not know--$1 trillion?"
"Mr. Davidoff","Twenty trillion dollars."
"Senator Levin","Twenty trillion dollars of exposure?"
"Chairman Lieberman","Here is an interesting number. From June 2006 until June 2008, the market value of outstanding credit default swaps increased from $294 billion to $3.1 trillion. So in just 2 years, it went up tenfold. That is a lot of money, even around here. You agree."
"Senator Levin","Thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you. Senator Tester is next. For Senator Burris' information, we have a rule on this Committee that we call on the Senators in the order of arrival, so you will be next after Senator Tester."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TESTER",""
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I, too, appreciate the hearing that you and the Ranking Member have lined up here. I do not know how many Members of this Committee are also on the Banking Committee. I am one. Senator Carper was one also. I do not think he is on it anymore. And I do not mean to speak for the chairman of the Banking Committee. You know him better than I do. But I would say that any suggestions this Committee could give to the Banking Committee would be well accepted. This is a very complex issue. And as you pointed out, it is an issue that I think the public wants something done here to re-establish faith in the marketplace."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator Tester. I forgot that you were on the Banking Committee. I did talk to Senator Dodd about the hearing, and he was encouraging. And, obviously, we defer to you in terms of legislation, but maybe this Committee can offer some suggestions about what form that should take."
"Senator Tester","We would be more than happy to take them forward and would be more than happy to hear suggestions even on a personal basis, because like I said, it is complex. I guess the question I would have for all three of you--you understand how complex the markets are, and you already talked about the holes and the overlaps and the fact that it does not work very well right now. How much time do you think, if we really got after it, would it take to develop a structure that would be comprehensive enough to add consumer confidence to the marketplace, but yet not so detailed that we have to fight fights we did not have to fight, and not so regulatory that it would take away flexibility in the system and deter growth? Just give me an idea on how long you think that would take to do something that would be thorough."
"Mr. Jackson","Well, I think that is a good question, and the way I think about it is on two levels. For Congress and the new Administration to come to a consensus about the direction that we should go in, whether it should be the two-peak model that I was outlining or a three-peak model that Professor Davidoff was suggesting, or a more narrow set of consolidations with a different agenda, I think that is something that could be decided in this session relatively quickly. I think that the task of implementing is one that you need to give a lot of thought to. Just as an example, in the United Kingdom there was a 3 to 4 year process from when the Blair government decided it was going to consolidate its supervision--it created a shell entity that carried the baggage, but the legislation took 3 years to enact. And, actually, they created the agency first, and it had the task of helping draft its own legislation. So I think the more you go to a really comprehensive solution, the more you are going to need to draw on expertise for this very technical task. One example, something that came up here that we did not mention in our testimony, is dealing with financial institution failures. Right now one of the problems, one of the reasons things are too big to fail is that we do not have a mechanism for wrapping up big institutions because we have the banks, the securities companies, the insurance companies, and the Federal Bankruptcy Code all interacting. Well, we should have a consolidated disposition process so when Lehman goes bankrupt, we can actually deal with it. And then we actually could make it fail because we would have a mechanism."
"Senator Tester","So you are saying several years."
"Mr. Jackson","Several years, yes."
"Senator Tester","Mr. Davidoff."
"Mr. Davidoff","I think I agree with that assessment. But I think that Congress can pass a bill that does it this session."
"Senator Tester","Mr. Dodaro."
"Mr. Dodaro","I think that part of it depends on a couple factors: One, that Congress required the Congressional Oversight Panel under TARP to submit a regulatory reform proposal; and also required the Secretary of Treasury to have a proposal. There have been a couple that have come forward from other sources, and to the extent to which there is a consensus gathering on some of those issues I think is important. But I think it is going to take time to do it right and to do it comprehensively."
"Senator Tester","Well, let me ask you this, then: If it takes that kind of time, do you think that there is any threat that--and I mean that just as it sounds--a regulatory system from outside this country could actually become the standard by which we live, from the European Union or Pacific Rim?"
"Mr. Davidoff","I think the answer to that is no. I mean, they are equally as troubled, and capital flows, although they can shift rapidly, are staying concentrated in the United States due to our----"
"Senator Tester","Do you see it the same, all of you? How about you, Mr. Jackson? You understand the question?"
"Mr. Jackson","No, I do not. Can you just repeat what the question is?"
"Senator Tester","What I am concerned about is that our regulatory system is screwed up right now, to be kind. The financial crisis is a worldwide situation, and if our reform is not done in a reasonable amount of time, would we have to live under the rules of another system--the European Union's financial system or the Pacific Rim's or however you want to put it? Do you see what I am saying? If ours is inadequate, does that mean we have to take theirs? Does that mean the companies, the investors, and all of the above adopt theirs?"
"Mr. Jackson","Well, I think that, as Professor Davidoff says, the companies will stay in the United States because there is so much business in the United States, and they are going to be here, and they will live with our rules. I think that we can learn from other jurisdictions, and I think we can have a more effective and cost-effective regulatory system if we move to consolidation, which is what is done around the world."
"Senator Tester","I would agree with you."
"Mr. Jackson","But we control our regulatory fate."
"Senator Tester","Good. That is all I need to know. Mr. Dodaro, do you see it the same way?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Basically."
"Senator Tester","Perfect. I have got a question, because it has been brought up a few times. My mother brought it up to me a while back, and it is something that we bounce off and around once in a while. We are 10 years after the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, which means we are also 10 years after the undoing of the Glass-Steagall Act. If the Glass-Steagall Act had still been in effect, do you think this same problem would have happened?"
"Mr. Jackson","I am fairly confident the same problem would have happened. The securitization process was already underway, and we did not need Gramm-Leach-Bliley to facilitate that."
"Mr. Davidoff","I think it exacerbated it. The banks and the investment banks began competing with each other, and the investment banks were not built to compete in that way."
"Senator Tester","So you are saying the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act exacerbated it."
"Mr. Davidoff","Yes."
"Mr. Dodaro","I think the question is more what was not done rather than what was done. And I think the necessary adjustments were not made to the regulatory structure to follow the policy decisions and what was going to occur in the market."
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I, too, would like to welcome Senator Burris to the Committee. I am sure that his opinions and perspectives will be much valued."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator Tester. Again, I am really happy that you are on the Banking Committee, and that gives us a good link to the work of that committee. Senator Burris, it is really a great honor--having met you before you came to the Senate, knowing of your service in Illinois, particularly the time as Attorney General, but obviously you have done a lot beyond that--to call on you for the first time to question the witnesses. Senator Burris of Illinois."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BURRIS",""
"Senator Burris","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. By the way, Mr. Chairman, I am also an old banker. I started out my career as the first black in this Nation to be a bank examiner for the Comptroller of the Currency, and I am sitting here just taking all this in."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is great."
"Senator Burris","And I have a couple of questions I would like to ask. One, have we really listed the various agencies? We have the FDIC. We have the SEC. How many agencies are involved that would be impacted by any type of regulations? And would we have to then seek to come up with some type of blanket or overall package that would impact each one of these agencies that has these piecemeal jurisdictions over all of these various entities? How many are there? You also try to get the Comptroller of the----"
"Mr. Davidoff","In the GAO report, they have nine, I believe, primary agencies. Which would be 10 if you included the Treasury. But I would ask that they confirm that."
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, there would be 10 with the Treasury, and I think your question is appropriate, both in designing the reform that would be put in place, but also making the transition as----"
"Senator Burris","As to try to tie all those together and get all of those different interests that are going to be protecting their turf and all the other types of situations that could cause a problem. Professor Jackson."
"Mr. Jackson","I think that there actually are some that the GAO report may not have included. I would include the Department of Labor with respect to Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) issues. I would include HUD with respect to mortgage lending. You could say that the most important financial agency for most people is the Social Security Administration with its retirement savings program. So there are a host of little pockets around government in addition to the primary agencies that one should think about collectively. But it is a large number."
"Mr. Davidoff","I would add that I do not expect that everything will be cleaned up into a neat package. I would recommend you build dominant regulators, whether you adopt a twin-peaks model, the three-peaks model, and have them over time--have their primary goal so they can absorb these functions."
"Senator Burris","And one other point that may seem a little bit farfetched, but I have to take my mind to the ultimate of all this, and that is the consumer and how would that consumer get impacted by this overall change in regulations. It was the consumer that ended up getting all caught up in these various different piecemeal approaches as the subprime lending, and then not only subprime but prime, got caught up in these equity loans and dropping house values. So that also impacted what happened in our financial markets because there are a lot of individuals who are not subprime who were just underwater. Their mortgages exceed the overall value of the property that they are living in, and that constant pressure of equity, take out the equity because it is not going to go down, and we found ourselves in serious trouble. The consumer has to be taken into consideration of how these regulations are going to impact them, and I just hope that we would give some thought to just how that person would ultimately be impacted by that."
"Mr. Jackson","Senator, one of the problems, as I see it, is that each of our agencies has a consumer protection division or a division of consumer affairs, but it takes a second seat to other functions at the Federal Reserve or at the OCC or the other agencies. And what we need to do is increase the salience and the importance of the consumer protection function, and that can be done with an accountability standard. It can be done in a consolidated agency by having a division of consumer affairs, perhaps with a political appointee and Senate confirmation to elevate the status. Or it could be done with a specialized market conduct regulator that has consumer protection as a mandate. But I think it starts with Congress saying that this is a major goal and setting up a structure that someone has that as their main mission, not as a secondary or tertiary mission, which tends to be what is going on nowadays."
"Senator Burris","Thank you very much."
"Mr. Dodaro","Senator, I completely agree with that, and that is one of the main characteristics that we point out that should be in the framework of crafting and evaluating proposals to reform the structure. Also, the States play a very important role here, as I am sure you are aware, based on your past position."
"Senator Burris","I am a former State Comptroller."
"Mr. Dodaro","And I do think that whatever is done ought to be to preserve and to build on that check and balance at the State level."
"Mr. Davidoff","And, again, I would just add a small point, which is it should have broad jurisdiction. So it is not just mortgage disclosure. It is credit card disclosure. It is financial protection for consumer financial products."
"Senator Burris","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you very much, Senator Burris. I appreciate that. Your question was an interesting one, and if you add on the State agencies that really do get involved, you could get pretty rapidly up to about 200 separate oversight--we have some ability, but we do not want to overdo it to deal with the State agencies as well and allocate authority. But it really is a fragmented system, and it does leave a lot of gaps, which give people room to play games in between."
"Senator Burris","Mr. Chairman, they mentioned one industry that really needs to be looked at, and that is the insurance industry."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes, sir."
"Senator Burris","We really have to check out the insurance industry."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you. I look forward to working with you on the Committee. We will do a second round for any of the Senators who want to ask additional questions. Professor Davidoff, I want to ask you one thing briefly, which is, in your testimony, interestingly, you mentioned that the lack of coordination between some of the existing regulatory agencies--in the case you particularly mentioned the FDIC, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve--may actually have contributed to the ad hoc and ultimately inadequate nature of the government's response to the current fiscal crisis. So the fragmentation in the system may not only create gaps that allow for the problems, but it also creates a problem in responding to a crisis or a scandal. Correct?"
"Mr. Davidoff","Correct. Obviously, I was not in the discussions, but from news reports it is clear that the regulators conflicted over what to do at certain times, and they lacked the full authority to address the crisis. And these bailouts, one reason why they are so haphazard is because they were structured within narrower limits of the law than they were subject to."
"Chairman Lieberman","I believe Mr. Dodaro first and then others mentioned the ideal or the goal that we may, as part of our reform, want to create a system in which the financial entities are asked to bear the cost of the risk. Just conceptually--the canvas is empty now and we are thinking about how to paint on it--what kind of system would that involve? Would it be fees up front?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Well, basically you would have to have some kind of fee structure. It would basically take the Bank Insurance Fund concept that is in place and replicate that or adapt it--is probably a better word--to the other types of services and products. This goes, too, to how the regulators should be funded to preserve their independence. So I think it is both a system that needs to be put in place modeled after the Bank Insurance Fund, conceptually, that would require that some fees be paid into a centralized fund that could then provide for the industry that is in need of it, but also have it be funded in a way where the regulators have clear independence. Right now they are funded in different schemes, which contribute to some of this difficulty in deciding how to hold people accountable."
"Chairman Lieberman","We have been reminded in the Bernie Madoff case that there is a fund there that can be drawn on to a limited degree to try to compensate people who were cheated by Mr. Madoff. But I presume that there are large areas of financial transactions where there is no such fund and, therefore, there is no coverage for loss. Correct, Professor Jackson?"
"Mr. Jackson","There is a complicated system of specific guarantees. It is limited given the losses in the Madoff case, but it is available for fraud of the sort that he engaged in apparently. And there is the FDIC fund for banks, there are State guarantee funds operated at the State level for insurance companies to protect individuals when institutions fail. I think the model for a systemic recovery would be the FDIC Improvements Act of 1991 (FDICIA), which basically says that if the FDIC saves a bank that is too big to fail and takes on extra costs, those extra costs are then charged back to the whole banking sector over some period of time. And TARP has that characteristic, too. There is a provision that says if TARP loses money--which it seems like it will--then in 5 years, the Treasury has to make a recommendation for a charge-back. So that is the kind of mechanism on the systemic risk side. I think for ordinary failures, the pre-funding model, which Mr. Dodaro referred to, is the sensible one. The FDIC fund is kept at a certain percentage of deposits, so that handles routine failures. But then when there is a special failure, you need to have some special mechanism. And it should be consistent throughout the financial services industry, and it is not right now. If the Federal Reserve loses money on some of its interventions, there is no mechanism to get recovery and there is no general system for charge-backs that I think would be important to put in place."
"Chairman Lieberman","Would you like to add anything to this discussion?"
"Mr. Davidoff","No. I think it has been adequately addressed."
"Chairman Lieberman","Good enough. Let me, since we are painting on a big canvas that is, obviously I would like to think, not filled now--as we reconsider where we are--we are dealing here in so many cases with an extraordinarily different international financial system where enormous sums of money travel with incredible rapidity, and one of you mentioned, using it for another point, how frustrated European regulators, or the British, are sometimes when they come here because they have to shop around or figure out who to talk to. This may be reaching a bit beyond, but in response to the current crisis--last year I remember reading that there was a town in Norway that was going under financially because it had put its money in mortgage-backed securities that were failing."
"Senator Burris","And Iceland."
"Chairman Lieberman","And Iceland, exactly. So should the United States be initiating some round of international discussions now to create either new international entities for financial regulation or institutionalizing or regularizing some kind of interaction between national regulators?"
"Mr. Jackson","Well, I mentioned the international connections, and I do think it is increasingly important for us to have coordination and cooperation, particularly with our leading economic allies. I think the tenor of today's discussion of having more regulation, tightening the regulation, is entirely appropriate. But it means that the pressure to move offshore is going to be strong."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Jackson","And there are two places people can move offshore. They are to the developed countries--Europe, Asia, and major markets--where we can and should have good coordination. I think the task of absolute harmonization is not an appropriate aspiration because their systems are different, their traditions are different. But we need to have convergence and coordination with these major entities. Then we need to collectively deal with the second group of entities, which are the offshore centers that we can only deal with collectively. And we have had some good experience internationally cooperating on that, but we need to be working with our allies to protect all of us against the offshore centers. So that is a priority."
"Chairman Lieberman","Mr. Dodaro or Mr. Davidoff, any response to our international responsibilities?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Well, I think there are two things at a minimum. One is there have been some international bodies of individuals from the different countries that have had some dialogues, and I know this was mentioned to me when I was in the United Kingdom talking to one of their treasury officials. And so there are proposals both to perhaps more institutionalize this, expand this type of regular discussion and dialogue on issues. Second, there should be some discussions looking at international organizations, like the International Monetary Fund and others, that could perhaps play an enhanced role in this. I am not positing any particular outcomes, but I do think international dialogue is very important as part of the equation in this particular issue."
"Mr. Davidoff","I would just add that I think there is already an extraordinary amount of dialogue between regulators, and the Federal Reserve, in fact, entered into a dollar loan program with the other banks in Europe because of their difficulties. I think that the issue is that although dialogue is good, we have to take a stand on some regulation and say this is where we will go, and because someone else does it differently does not mean that we have to set it there. Now, that should be done with the regulatory process, and we need to keep the preeminence of the U.S. capital markets, and the best way to do that is through treaties and cooperation but also by saying you are not going to be able to come into our system, which is the largest system, if you don't play by our rules."
"Chairman Lieberman","Excellent. Thanks. Senator Collins."
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Davidoff, I want to talk further with you about the ``too big to fail'' issue, which the Chairman raised at one point. It concerns me that we are creating a classic moral hazard. If we send the signal--and, indeed, we are sending the signal--that if you are big enough so that there are consequences to the economy in terms of job losses or other cascading effects that we are not going to allow you to fail, we take away any incentive to carefully manage risk. In addition, we encourage companies to become bigger and bigger or to enter into financial arrangements where there are more complex and interlocking transactions to make these institutions' failure too consequential for our economy. How do we prevent that? I know that is not an easy question, but I am really concerned that we are sending a message to just become bigger and bigger, riskier and riskier, and don't worry, Uncle Sam will bail you out?"
"Mr. Davidoff","This is a hard one. Let me give you just a quick anecdote. When Lehman failed, it defaulted on its commercial paper, which was held by the money market funds, including Prime Reserve, which broke the buck. In the space of 48 hours, over $200 billion was taken out of money market funds. Money market funds, if they do not have money, can't buy commercial paper. Most of industrial America finances its operations through commercial paper. Literally, the cash machines almost shut down. Because Lehman defaulted on its commercial paper, the money market funds were losing all their funds and couldn't fund the commercial paper market. Companies couldn't get their commercial paper, and they were unable in that market to get their financing. And that just shows how tightly interconnected the world is today. I think what you do--and I look forward to a vigorous debate and the other experts offering their opinions--is two things. First, ironically we have been building big institutions through this process. You need to manage those institutions. And, second, I think this has been such an extreme event that the moral hazard effects may be reduced. But we need to put in incentives for the people who are trading and running these institutions that they will be penalized. I hate to jump into the executive compensation arena--and we certainly shouldn't, in doing regulatory reform--but you need incentives that people will be punished. They can't leave with a $1 million exit package. If their institutions fail, they should leave with nothing, including without their country club membership."
"Senator Collins","Professor Jackson, I would like you to address this as well, but I also want you to address a related issue. When I look at the financial markets--and it is related to the problem I have just outlined--an issue at risk is divorced from responsibility at every step along the way. It used to be that your community bank made the loan, kept the loan, so if the loan went bad, that institution bore the consequences. Now, the mortgage broker may make the loan and take his fee. He does not care what happens to the loan after that. Then it goes on to the financial institution, which takes its fee. Then it is sold on the secondary market. Everybody is getting a cut along the way. Then when the mortgage is sliced and diced and securitized, it means that nobody is really bearing the risk of the decisions that were made. And yet everybody is taking a cut and getting paid along the way."
"Mr. Jackson","Right."
"Senator Collins","And I don't know what we do about this."
"Mr. Jackson","Well, this has definitely been a problem. You describe the nature of the huge moral hazard agency problem that the mortgage financing system has generated. One thing that I will say going forward is if we look at the system backwards and we think of that pension fund up in Norway that ended up holding mortgage paper, it is going to be a lot more careful the next time it buys American securities, if it ever does. So I think we can expect some pretty severe market corrections, and one of the ironies is we are living in a market over-reaction. No one wants to finance mortgages anymore, which is part of our problem that we are currently in. So some of the correction is going to come from people who have been burnt who are going to be more careful. We clearly need to look at these relationships and decide when there is not enough skin in the game and whether we want to have a mortgage brokerage industry operating the way it has in the past. I am quite dubious anyone will ever buy mortgages from the old mortgage broker system. But we need to look at those conflicts very carefully. On too big to fail, one thing I would just like to say is it is important for groups like GAO to think hard about why institutions are too big to fail. And sometimes the reason is we have allowed them to enter into such complicated transactions and complicated networks that we can't unwind them. So I think AIG, Lehman, and Bear Stearns have this characteristic. The solution is make a better swap system with clearinghouses, and then if we had a good clearing system, we can let them fail. So you can prevent ``too big to fail'' by not having complex payment systems or complex clearing systems. So that is a prospective solution. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they are too big to fail because they had too large a share of the mortgage business, and we also let every bank in the country buy as much stock or bonds of Fannie and Freddie as they wanted. Now, that is a recipe for too big to fail. If we are going to have government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) in the future, which is an open question, we should make them smaller. We should not let their financial significance be so big so that if one of them needs to shut down we can't just shut it down. So we can correct some aspects of too big to fail going forward. If we have a disposition mechanism that can handle liquidation in a sensible way, that will also give us more latitude. So smart regulation can allow us to enforce market discipline, and I think that is an important lesson going forward."
"Senator Collins","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I am going to have to leave, and I apologize that I will not hear the Senator's final round of questions, if he has some--he is done? Well. Could I just read for the record from Warren Buffett?"
"Chairman Lieberman","Go right ahead."
"Senator Collins","In 2002--he is not called ``The Oracle'' for nothing--he wrote to his shareholders, and he said, ``We at Berkshire Hathaway try to be alert to any sort of mega- catastrophe risk, and that posture makes us unduly appreciative about the burgeoning quantities of long-term derivative contracts and the massive amount of uncollateralized receivables that are growing alongside.'' Listen to this statement: ``In our view, however, derivatives are financial weapons of mass destruction, carrying dangers that, while now latent, are potentially lethal.'' How sad it is that when Warren Buffett said this in 2002 that the regulators apparently weren't listening."
"Chairman Lieberman","Amen. Thanks, Senator Collins. Senator Burris, no further questions?"
"Senator Burris","No."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks so much. I appreciate it. The three of you have been excellent witnesses and, again, I thank you, Mr. Dodaro, for the GAO report. You have really gotten us off to a good start here. We are quite serious about this. Actually, I think in talking to the Members, you have engaged our interest. I wonder if I could presume on your service to the Committee thus far--this is a pleasure that a Senator gets in giving two law professors a homework assignment, so to speak, which is, I am really intrigued by the two-peak/three-peak model. I am not asking for a law journal article because I know you are very busy, but if you would for the benefit of the Committee, in writing, over the next couple of weeks just outline, with what we have now, how would you bring agencies together? How would you change things? I think it would be very helpful to us and to the Congress overall. Mr. Dodaro, to the extent that you are able to do that within your mandate, we would, of course, really welcome the same from you. And we are glad to talk to you more about the best way we can do that."
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, I would like to give that some thought, and we could have some follow-up dialogue."
"Chairman Lieberman","Good."
"Mr. Dodaro","And I would also like to recognize the fine efforts of the GAO team that put the report together."
"Chairman Lieberman","It is another excellent piece of work to assist Congress and in the public interest by GAO. I appreciate it. We will keep the record of this hearing open for 15 days in case any of you want to submit additional testimony or any of the Members want to submit testimony or questions to you. But I can't thank you enough for bringing forth your expertise to help us prevent another crisis such as the one we are going through now. With that, the hearing is adjourned."

"OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN",""
"Chairman Lieberman","Good morning and welcome. Thanks for coming a bit early. As you know, we moved the hearing up so that we might attend the joint session to hear British Prime Minister Gordon Brown. This is the second in our series of hearings examining the structure of our Nation's financial regulatory system in the aftermath of its obvious failure to protect us from the economic crisis that we are suffering through now. We are undertaking this series of hearings pursuant to Senate rules that give our Committee the responsibility for ``the organization and reorganization of the Executive Branch of the government'' as well as for the study of ``the efficiency, economy and effectiveness of all agencies and departments of the government.'' By examining what changes should be made to improve and modernize the organization of the Federal regulatory system, we are not only fulfilling these responsibilities, but we hope to be preparing ourselves to make recommendations to our colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee about reforms that they may be considering reporting out to deal with gaps in our financial regulatory system. In other words, we see our unique role here as reaching a judgment about the structures through which we are regulating financial institutions, and not so much about the day to day regulations. This is particularly important based on what we heard at our first hearing from the witnesses, which was that our Nation's outdated and fragmented system of financial regulation is unable to handle risks that occur across many different types of institutions, markets, and activities. Today's hearing will examine the pros and cons of creating a systemic risk regulator for the financial services industry. The first obvious question is what is a systemic risk regulator? I gather that it means a risk that a failed institution, a risky activity, or a particular event could broadly affect the financial system rather than just one institution or activity. And, frankly, I want our witnesses to help educate me about the difference between that systemic risk regulating function and the other problem that we heard about at the last hearing, which is that there are, today, gaps in our regulatory system that leave trillions of dollars of economic activity unregulated. The fact is that there is no one government agency or market participant responsible for monitoring systemic risks to the integrity of our entire financial system, and that is a significant fact. Many experts believe that the gap should be bridged by creation of what we are calling a systemic risk regulator who would supervise or which would supervise the financial system holistically. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke has given us another title to chew over. He has referred to such an entity as a macro-prudential regulator. And I will wait for the three of you to help me understand that. Part of the reason our current watch dogs failed, we learned at the last hearing, is because each has just a piece of the system to oversee. That, as I said a moment ago, leaves gaps. For as long as there have been markets, obviously, there have been speculative bubbles and resulting financial crises. But through sensible regulation, I believe we can improve the ability of our financial system to prevent and withstand such shocks, reduce vulnerability to extreme crises and limit the damage to our economy when a crisis occurs. And so, we come to this hearing with a series of questions and an excellent group of witnesses, questions like: Can the role of monitoring and responding to systemic risks be accomplished by expanding the authority of one or more existing regulatory institutions or should Congress create a totally new entity to act as a systemic risk regulator? What would be the responsibilities of that body? What tools would it need to meet those responsibilities? And what would its relationship be with other regulators? We have an excellent panel of witnesses before us today, and I look forward to their testimony."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS",""
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today, as the Chairman has indicated, our Committee is examining the need to establish a systemic risk monitor that might have helped to prevent the financial crisis that our Nation now confronts, and I will stick with the term systemic risk monitor rather than macro-prudential regulator. America's financial crisis has spread from Wall Street to Main Street, affecting the livelihoods of people all across the country. The American people deserve the protection of a new regulatory system that modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and soundness requirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive risk-taking and improves oversight, accountability and transparency. Our financial regulators should have had the ability to see the current collapse coming and to act quickly to prevent or mitigate its impacts. Unfortunately, oversight gaps in our existing system, risky financial instruments with little or no regulatory oversight and a lack of attention to systemic risk undermined our financial markets. When the entire financial sector gambled on the rise of the housing market, no single regulator could see that everyone from mortgage brokers to credit default swap traders was betting on a bubble that was about to burst. Instead, each agency viewed its regulated market through a narrow tunnel, missing the total risk that permeated our financial markets. When the housing market collapsed, the impact set off a wave of consequences. Borrowers could no longer refinance their mortgages. Credit markets were frozen. Consumer demand plummeted. Businesses were unable to make payments or to meet payrolls. And workers were laid off, making it even more difficult for families to pay their mortgages. In Maine, the unemployment rate has reached a 16-year high of 7 percent at the end of 2008. There were also more than 2,800 foreclosures in my State, not that many compared to other States but nearly a 900 percent increase from the previous year. This financial crisis has harmed virtually every American family. Taxpayers have financed bailout after bailout of huge financial institutions at the cost of trillions of dollars. These drastic and expensive rescues might not have occurred had there been a regulator evaluating risk to the financial system as a whole. Such a regulator could have recognized the house of cards being constructed in our financial markets. While there are certainly many regulators at both the Federal and State levels, not one of them had the ability to evaluate risk across the entire financial system. For example, the Federal Reserve could clearly see the large number of securitized mortgages of banks within its jurisdiction, but it had virtually no visibility into the full extent of securitization at non-federally regulated banks or financial institutions under the purview of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). What was needed then and is needed now is the systemic risk regulator. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) and other government and industry officials as well as academic experts have called for the creation of such a monitor. But, as the Chairman indicated, the creation of a systemic risk monitor raises many new questions about its structure and authority. Should it be an existing regulator such as the Federal Reserve that is charged with monitoring systemic risk or should an entirely new entity be tasked with that responsibility? My belief is that we should establish a council composed of the heads of our Nation's financial regulatory agencies that could be an interagency task force. We must also consider what should occur when systemic risk is detected. Should a systemic risk entity be empowered to issue its own regulations to review and approve new financial instruments and to fill the regulatory black holes that result from overlapping or narrow agency jurisdictions or should the monitor be required to work through existing regulators? In designing a better regulatory framework, we must take care not to create a moral hazard by implying that this entity exists to make failure impossible. We must also take care not to stifle the creation of innovative, useful new products nor to prevent beneficial risk-sharing. The challenge is to ease the turmoil caused by failing of important institutions without setting off a cascade of trouble for otherwise healthy entities. In other words, we need a better system to prevent the development of catastrophic concentrations of risk at firms like Bear Stearns, AIG, and better systems to mitigate the collateral damage if they do fail. Our goals must combine several vital objectives: Stability for the financial system, safety and soundness regulation for institutions, protections for investors and consumers, transparency and accountability for transactions, and increased financial literacy for the public. Significant regulatory reforms are required to restore public confidence and to ensure that a lack of regulation does not allow such a crisis to occur in the future. In fact, I would contend that one reason why we have not seen a stabilization of our markets is because the public continues to lack confidence. One step that we can take that would make a real difference is the creation of a stronger, more effective regulatory system to help restore that confidence, and that is why this set of hearings that the Chairman has initiated are so important. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing our witnesses."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Senator Collins. I agree with you totally on that last point. I know people within the Administration and our colleagues on the Banking Committee are working on this. It is very important because, obviously, the troubles in the markets, notwithstanding what we and the Administration have been trying to do, reflect a lack of confidence, and one part of that clearly is in the ability of the government to protect investors and consumers. Let's go right to the witnesses with thanks that you are here. First is Dr. Robert Litan, Vice President for Research and Policy at the Kauffman Foundation. Thanks for being here."
"STATEMENT OF ROBERT E. LITAN, PH.D.,\1\ VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH AND POLICY, EWING MARION KAUFFMAN FOUNDATION",""
"Mr. Litan","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Senator Collins for inviting me to appear on this very distinguished panel. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Litan appears in the Appendix on page 158. We are here, of course, because we are all in the midst of the worst financial crisis of our lives and because of our ardent desire to never see something like this again. To realize this objective, we must reduce and contain systemic financial risk, the subject of this hearing. Your staff has asked me to provide a few scene-setting remarks before addressing the questions you posed. Our financial system has long rested on two pillars: Market discipline and sound regulation and supervision of key financial institutions and markets. Both pillars failed us. Shareholders and creditors of now failed financial institutions did not prevent what happened, but also we did not have policies in place to assure that market discipline would work effectively. Mortgage documents and the securities backed by mortgages were not transparent. With too many borrowers, the institutions that securitized their loans and the institutions that bought these securities also did not have enough money at risk to ensure prudent behavior. Likewise, we all thought that regulators were on top of the risk and the capital levels at our financial institutions. We were wrong. Reforms are needed to fix these errors. We are here today, however, to do more than that, specifically, how to address systemic risk which, as you, Mr. Chairman, accurately described, is the transmission of losses at one or more failed financial institutions simultaneously or at near time coincidence with each other throughout the rest of the financial system. I also agree with you that we cannot expect to prevent all future asset bubbles like the housing bubble, but the public does have a right to expect reform to reduce the size of those future bubbles and, obviously, to reduce the economic costs when they pop. The place to begin is to establish an effective system of regulating the solvency and improving the transparency of systemically important financial institutions (SIFIs). In my view, this oversight is best carried out by a single agency, not a collection of agencies, with due apologies to"
"Senator Collins","President Truman had a famous sign on his desk: The buck stops here. Well, the buck stops here dictum, if we apply it here, and I think we should, means that one agency, not many agencies, should have clear responsibility over SIFIs. Among the alternatives that I survey in my written remarks, I believe that the ideal solution, if I could play God, is to consolidate all the Federal financial regulation into two bodies, one for solvency and the Treasury under former Secretary Henry Paulson."
"Chairman Lieberman","Just go into that a little bit. When you say all, just give us a little more detail of what agencies we are talking about."
"Mr. Litan","On the banking side, I am talking about all the banking agencies. I think we ought to have Federal regulation of large systemically important insurers which we, of course, now do not have at all."
"Chairman Lieberman","So when you are saying all the banking regulators, you are talking about the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)."
"Mr. Litan","OCC and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC)."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Litan","And the Federal Reserve functions of solvency. And you have large insurers. I would put them there too. You would have the solvency of broker dealers. Essentially, an agency charged with solvency. Then you would have an agency charged with consumer protection which would consolidate all the consumer protection arms of each of these agencies. Plus, I would add the consumer protection power of the of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), and we ought to have a financial consumer protection agency. I mean those are the two functions that we are worried about, and in an ideal world I would consolidate them."
"Chairman Lieberman","Then the SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC)?"
"Mr. Litan","I would combine those and make them part of the consumer protection agency."
"Chairman Lieberman","OK."
"Mr. Litan","And the Paulson Treasury plan had--I am departing now from my prepared remarks here. But they also suggested that the Federal Reserve would be a free safety, roaming out there to pick and choose what it wanted to do. In my written remarks, I am worried about the free safety model because it is just a recipe for regulatory overlap, especially with vague and ambiguous powers that you would give the Federal Reserve. So, to go back to what I was saying, that is my ideal world. We do not live in an ideal world, and I do not expect something like this to happen. I would be glad if it did. So, as a fallback, I urge that the Federal Reserve be the logical systemic risk regulator. My third choice would be to create a new regulator and leave everything else intact. I am not wild about this alternative because we already have enough cooks in the kitchen. This would just add another one, and it would be a recipe, I think, for overlap, jurisdictional fights, and fingerpointing after the fact and so forth. And, finally, we come to the last suggestion which is the so-called college of supervisors. I am not wild about this either because it preserves too many cooks in the kitchen. I think, again, as I said, it violates the buck stops here principle. So that is my least favorite alternative. Now there are a lot of details of how systemic risk regulation would have to be carried out, and so I think the Congress, if I were writing legislation, should provide very broad language and leave the details to the agency and then have Congress oversee the agency rather closely. Let me just give you an example of a few of the issues that would have to be addressed: First, there has to be a clear process for identifying the SIFIs and to allow an institution that is designated as a SIFI to remove itself if the situation warrants. Factors such as size, leverage and the degree of interconnection with the financial system, as the Group of Thirty has suggested, would be, I think, obvious ways to define the SIFIs. Clearly, large banks, large insurers and, conceivably, some hedge funds and some private equity funds could meet the SIFI test. So would the major clearinghouses, the exchanges, including the new exchanges or clearinghouses that are now contemplated for credit default swaps. Footnote: There is a recent report by the Geneva Reports on the World Economy--an excellent report, by the way--that has come out. It also recommends something like this, but it suggests in an ideal world that the list of SIFIs would be kept private. You would not publicize the names of them to address the moral hazard concern that, Senator Collins, you rightly point to. I do not think that is feasible because the reality is you would have to disclose, if you were a public company, what special rules you are subject to, if you have higher capital and liquidity rules. And the markets would be able to interpret very clearly, if you have these higher standards, that you are a SIFI. So I think you cannot keep the list quiet. That is just my view. Second, SIFIs should be subject to tougher regulation, specifically capital and liquidity, than other financial institutions precisely in order to address the moral hazard concern. Capital standards should be countercyclical but only if the minimum capital standard is raised over time and--and this is very important--the required ratios for good times and bad are publicized in advance so that everybody knows what the rules are. If you do not have clear rules what will happen is that you will relax the rules in bad times, but you will not raise them in good times. So the capital rules have to be super clear at the outset. Third, the systemic risk regulator should not rely solely on supervisors to watch over SIFIs because we know that supervisors and regulators are not perfect. Trust me. I have been hearing an earful from the public about this. So I think we need to harness what I call stable market discipline to supplement regulators, and the best source of stable discipline is long-term uninsured, unsecured, and subordinated debt. SIFIs should be required to back a certain portion of their assets with this long-term debt, or the long- term money which cannot run. Such debt is not like short-term deposits. Because the long-term money is stuck, the holders of such debt have tremendous incentives to monitor the institution to insure that it is not taking excessive risk, and that is another way to address the moral hazard concern. Fourth, and this is critically important, SIFIs should be required to submit and gain approval for early closure and loss-sharing plans in the event they get into trouble. These plans could limit, though possibly not eliminate, losses from their failure. I was going to address some of the critics of the SIFI approach, but I think we have addressed the moral hazard concern, and I will not go into great detail on that issue. I have a number of responses to the other criticisms in my written testimony. I have a couple final points. One is that you cannot put all your eggs in a systemic regulator basket. There have to be other tools to address systemic risk, and so I address two of them in my testimony. First, my colleague, Alice Rivlin at Brookings, has suggested that the systemic risk regulator provide an annual or perhaps more frequent report to Congress on systemic risk regulation. Highlight the areas, for example, of rapid asset growth or areas where there may be particular vulnerabilities so that the system, you and the public are alert to the dangers. And, if there are needed recommendations, the regulator would provide them. Second, regulators should encourage financial institutions to tie their pay to long-term performance, not to short-term results. Finally, I want to say just a few words about the global nature of the problems we are facing and what we should do about them globally. Clearly, we are all witnessing the fact that the troubles in the United States have now reverberated around the world. So, naturally, the rest of the world wants us to participate in some kind of global macro solution to the current problems. That is why President Obama is going to the April 2, 2009, meeting in London. That is why President Bush agreed to the G- 20 meeting in November. I have a couple words of caution, not that I am against global coordination. I am all for that. We need to learn from other countries. But for those who say that we ought to harmonize all our rules with the rest of the world before we act, I strongly disagree, and I will give you a prime example why. We have something called the Basel II Capital Accords. I have written for years about how I think these things were horribly mistaken. As it turns out, the biggest mistake is they took 10 years to develop, and by the time they went into effect we had a full blown banking crisis. And so, I hate to repeat that episode. By the way, the substance of the Basel rules turned out to be bad. They ignored liquidity. They were 400 pages of complexity that only risk modelers could love. They delegated authority to credit rating agencies, and now we learned how that was a mistake. There were complicated formulas that tried to measure risk that did not do it well. The bottom line is let's not spend our time trying to negotiate with the rest of the world what our rules should be. We know enough to fix our own problems, and we should do that. And the final point I would like to make goes to the issue of a global financial regulator. I do not think any of the countries in the G-20 are ready to cede financial regulation to an uncreated, untested global regulator. We have plenty of work to do at home, and I think we should do it. That will conclude my formal remarks. Thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Dr. Litan. Very helpful. Very interesting. I gather that at 11 a.m., according to the previews, Prime Minister Brown may be talking about an international global financial New Deal. Though I must say I heard him respond to a question about that on the radio yesterday, and his answer was quite vague which meant either that he was holding the details for this morning or there are no details, and we will see as time goes on."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Chairman, I just want to explain to our witnesses that I have a conflict that I need to leave for. I have read all of their testimony, and I am very interested. If humanly possible, I will try to get back, but I do look forward to talking further with the experts that you have brought together today."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Senator Collins, and I understand why you have to go. And thank you for being in this, as in most everything else, such a supportive partner. Thank you very much. Next, we are going to hear from Damon Silvers who is Associate Counsel at the AFL-CIO and a member of the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) Congressional Oversight Panel. We probably could hold a separate hearing on that, but for now we welcome you on the question before us this morning, Mr. Silvers."
"STATEMENT OF DAMON A. SILVERS,\1\ DEPUTY CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT PANEL, AND ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AFL-CIO",""
"Mr. Silvers","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for the honor of inviting me here today. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Silvers appears in the Appendix on page 178. As you know, I am Associate General Counsel of the AFL-CIO, and I am a member and Deputy Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. My testimony today will include a discussion of the Congressional Oversight Panel's report on regulatory reform mandated by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.\2\ However, my testimony reflects my views and does not necessarily reflect the views of the panel, its chair, Elizabeth Warren, or its staff. \2\ The report submitted by Mr. Silvers appears in the Appendix on page 190. We have inherited a financial regulatory landscape designed in part to address issues of systemic risk. The SEC's disclosure-based system of securities regulation and the FDIC's system of deposit insurance came into being not just to protect the economic interests of depositors or investors but as mechanisms for insuring systemic stability, respectively, by walling off bank depositors from broader market risks and ensuring that investors in securities markets had the information necessary to police firm risk-taking and to monitor the risks embedded in particular financial products. But, as both the Chairman and Senator Collins have noted, in recent years, financial activity has moved away from regulated and transparent markets and institutions and into the so-called shadow markets. Regulatory barriers like the Glass- Steagall Act that once walled off less risky from more risky parts of the financial system have been weakened or dismantled. And we have seen a significant concentration in banking activity in the hands of very large financial institutions. So we entered the recent period of extreme financial instability with an approach to systemic risk that looked a lot like that applied during the period following the creation of the Federal Reserve Board but before the New Deal. But with the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Federal rescues of AIG and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the Federal response turned toward a much more aggressive set of interventions in an effort to ensure that after the collapse of Lehman Brothers there would be no more defaults by large financial institutions. Of course, this kind of approach was made much more explicit by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act and the TARP program. It has become very clear that our government and other governments around the world will step in when major financial institutions face bankruptcy. We do not live in a world of free market discipline when it comes to large financial institutions, and it seems unlikely that we ever will. But we have no clear governmental entity charged with making the decision over which company to rescue and which to let fail, no clear criteria for how to make such decisions, and no clear set of tools to use in stabilizing those that must be stabilized. And I would submit to you that, unfortunately, the Act passed last fall did not really fix these problems. In addition, we appear to be hopelessly confused as to what it means to stabilize a troubled financial institution to avoid systemic harm. In crafting a systematic approach to systemically significant institutions, we should begin with the understanding that while a given financial institution may be systemically significant, not every layer of its capital structure should necessarily be propped up with taxpayer funds. In response to these circumstances, the Congressional Oversight Panel, in its report to Congress mandated by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, made the following points about addressing systemic risk: First, we agreed with both you and Senator Collins and the prior witness that there should be a body charged with monitoring sources of systemic risk in the financial system, and we left open the options that it could be a new agency, an existing agency, or a group of existing agencies. Second, the body charged with systemic risk management needs to be fully accountable and transparent to the public in a manner that exceeds the general accountability mechanisms present today either in the Federal Reserve Board or in other self-regulatory organizations. If the Congress and the President were to look to the Federal Reserve, the panel recommended that there would have to be governance changes. Third, contrary to Mr. Litan's testimony, we should not identify specific institutions in advance as too big to fail, but, rather, we should have a regulatory framework in which, in a graduated fashion, institutions have higher capital requirements and pay more in insurance funds on a percentage basis than smaller institutions which are less likely to need to be rescued as being too systemic to fail. Fourth, we do, here, very much agree with Mr. Litan that systemic risk regulation cannot be a substitute for routine disclosure, accountability, safety and soundness, and consumer protection regulation of financial institutions and financial markets. Fifth, effective protection against systemic risk requires that shadow markets--institutions like hedge funds and products like credit derivatives--must not only be subject to systemic risk-oriented oversight but must also be brought within a framework of routine capital market regulation by agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission. Sixth, and here again I echo the testimony of the prior witness, we found that there are some specific problems in the regulation of financial markets--such as issues of incentives built into executive compensation plans and the conflicts of interest inherent in the credit rating agencies' business model of issuer pays--that need to be addressed to have a larger market environment where systemic risk is well managed. And, finally, the panel found that there will not be effective re-regulation of the financial markets in general, and including in the area of systemic risk, without a global regulatory floor. However, I think it is very clear that our recommendations agree with Mr. Litan that this should not and cannot be an excuse for inaction here in the United States now. As to who exactly should be the systemic risk monitor, well, the panel made no recommendation. I have come to believe that the best approach is a body made up of the key regulators much as Senator Collins described. There are several reasons for my conclusion. First, such a body must have as much access as possible to regulatory agency expertise and to all the information extant about the condition of the financial markets, including not just banks and bank holding companies but securities, commodities, and futures and consumer credit markets, more broadly. The reality of the interagency environment is that for information to flow freely all the agencies involved need some level of involvement with the agency seeking the information, and I do not believe it is practical or wise to try to duplicate or centralize all capital markets information in one new agency or one existing agency. Second, as I noted earlier, the panel concluded this coordinating body must be fully public. While many have argued the need for this body to be fully public in the hope that would make for a more effective regulatory culture, the TARP experience which you alluded to, Mr. Chairman, highlights a much more bright-line problem. An effective systemic risk regulator must have the power to bail out institutions. The experience of the last year is that liquidity provision is simply not enough in a real crisis. An organization that has the power to expend public funds to rescue private institutions must be a public organization. Here, the distinction really is between lending money and investing in equity much as we have done in the TARP program, though such a body should be insulated from politics--much as our other financial regulatory bodies are--to some degree by independent agency structures. As to the Federal Reserve, while the Federal Reserve can offer liquidity, many actual bailouts, as I said, require equity infusions which the Federal Reserve currently cannot make nor should it be able to make as long as the Federal Reserve continues to exist as a not entirely public institution. In particular, the very bank holding companies the Federal Reserve regulates today are involved in the governance of the regional Federal Reserve banks that are responsible for carrying out the Federal Reserve's regulatory mission on a daily basis and would, if the current structure were untouched, be involved in deciding which member banks or bank holding companies would receive taxpayer funds in a crisis. These considerations also point out the tensions that exist between the Board of Governors as to the Federal Reserve's role as central banker and the great importance of distance from the political process in that function and the necessity of political accountability and oversight once a body is discharged with disbursing the public's money to private companies that are in trouble. That function must be executed publicly and with clear oversight or else there will be inevitable suspicions of favoritism that will be harmful to the political underpinnings of any stabilization effort, and I think we have seen some of that in recent months. One benefit of a more collective approach to systemic risk monitoring, as Senator Collins suggested, is that the Federal Reserve Board could participate in such a body, and I believe that is essential. You cannot do this function, I think, without the Federal Reserve's involvement while having to do much less restructuring of the Federal Reserve's governance that would likely be problematic in terms of the Federal Reserve's monetary policy role. More broadly, these issues return us to the question of whether the dismantling of the approach to systemic risk embodied in the Glass-Steagall Act was a mistake. We would appear now to be in a position where we cannot wall off more risky activities from less risky liabilities like demand deposits or commercial paper that we wish to insure. On the other hand, it seems mistaken to try and make large securities firms behave as if they were commercial banks. Finally, as I said earlier, the regulation of the shadow markets and of the capital markets as a whole cannot be shoved into the category labeled systemic risk regulation and then have that category effectively become a kind of night watchman effort. The lesson of the failure of the Federal Reserve to use its consumer protection powers to address the rampant abuses in the mortgage industry earlier in this decade is just one of several examples going to the point that without effective routine regulation of financial markets, efforts to minimize the risk of further systemic breakdowns are not likely to succeed. In conclusion, the Congressional Oversight Panel's report lays out some basic principles that, as a panel member, I hope will be of use to this Committee and to Congress in thinking through the challenges involved in rebuilding a more comprehensive approach to systemic risk. The key, though, in the end is to make sure that as Congress approaches the issue of systemic risk, it does so in a way that bolsters a broader re-regulation of our financial markets, closing in a day-to-day way the profound gaps in our system that both you and Senator Collins alluded to, and that systemic risk regulation, while it is important that it be done, does not become an excuse for not engaging in that broader re-regulation. Thank you very much."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Mr. Silvers. Excellent statement. I will have some questions for you. Our last witness is Bob Pozen. It is good to see you again."
"Mr. Pozen","Glad to see you, Senator."
"Chairman Lieberman","We go back some distance to our halcyon student days."
"Mr. Pozen","Yes, those were the days."
"Chairman Lieberman","Those were the days, my friend. That is the end of our discussion of that subject. But, Mr. Pozen has gone on to be a leader in the financial services business over the years. He comes to us today from MFS Investment Management and has really been a creative thinker on a lot of public finance questions over the years, to the benefit of Congress and previous presidents. So, it is great to have you here today to help us understand this question and hopefully to do something constructive about it. Thank you."
"STATEMENT OF ROBERT C. POZEN,\1\ CHAIRMAN, MFS INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT",""
"Mr. Pozen","Thank you, Senator, and thank you and your Committee for inviting me to speak. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Pozen appears in the Appendix on page 304. Instead of giving a long presentation, let me try to really focus in on a few of the issues. Are we likely to have more or less systemic risk failures? There was a study done on how many financial crises we have had in the 20th Century. This study was done by Professor Eichengreen from Berkeley. From 1945 to 1971, there were 38 financial crises across the world. Between 1973 and 1997, there were 139 financial crises of which 44 took place in high income countries. In the last decade, besides this one, we have seen the Asian financial crisis and the dot.com crisis. So I think it is fair to say that the trend line for crises is definitely rising. Now you ask a good question about what is systemic risk, and I do agree that it is a term that is loosely thrown around a lot. To me, one of the more useful exercises is to think about what historically have been the leading indicators that have come before financial crises if you look at them as a group. There are five indicators that we can say that tend to occur, though not always, before a financial crisis. The first is that when a country has a very much above trend line set of real estate prices. This is not just true in the United States but was true in Japan, and also was true in Australia and other countries. A country must be way above trend line, which is what we were, and financed by a credit boom. You need both--not just real estate prices above trend line, but also financed by a credit boom of easy money. That combination is often associated with a crash at the end. The second leading indicator is very high leverage ratios. For example, if we look at all the things that happened in 2004, the SEC agreed to essentially allow the five investment banks to triple their leverage ratios from about 10 to 1 to 30 to 1. Such a high leverage does lead to a potential for systemic risk because then all you need is a small loss, and you are in trouble. At that point, you would like to raise capital, but you cannot. And so, you start selling assets, which depresses the price of assets held by others. In this manner, you start a downward spiral. The third leading indicator is when you have gaps in the regulatory system. Here, probably the most obvious was for credit default swaps (CDS). But these gaps for CDS were not hidden. People knew them. People saw them. People had a chance to make a decision on them, and they chose not to act. Then in this regulatory vacuum, credit default swaps increased quickly to the $50 to $60 trillion level of nominal value. The fourth leading indicator is having an asset class that experiences explosive growth. That is what we saw in the collateralized debt obligation (CDO) market, for instance. When you see a product that goes from small to very large, you ought to beware. Similarly, we went from $250 billion in hedge funds assets to $2 trillion in about 10 years. Either hedge fund managers are absolute geniuses or there is something that does not quite make sense there. So this type of growth spurt is very much worth looking at. The fifth leading indicator is the mismatch between long- term assets and liabilities. This, obviously, was characteristic of the savings and loan crisis where you had long-term mortgages and short-term deposits. What is less known is that many issuers of securitized assets recreated this mismatch problem. So you would have long- term mortgages bought by a special purpose entity, which would be financed by 60-day or 180-day commercial paper. Such a mismatch has the potential to create a liquidity crisis. So those are five areas that we really ought to look at closely. It may be more useful, rather than talk theoretically about systemic risk, to focus on those five types of situations. What should we do to prevent systemic risks from materializing? Let's start with efforts to close the regulatory gaps. We had a chance to regulate hedge funds as well as credit default swaps. But we chose not to in both cases--one a product, the other an institution. So there were regulatory gaps which were discussed but not closed, not for lack of knowledge, but for lack of political will. Second, we gave various regulators only partial jurisdiction over their own turf. The most important example is that the SEC did not have jurisdiction over the holding company of investment banks. In fact, if you look at the whole Lehman complex--let's say there were 200 subsidiaries--the SEC probably had jurisdiction over less than 10. So you need a consolidated regulator for each institution because we know people can play games with affiliates and parents and these sorts of things. That is really a crucial objective. Third, as Mr. Litan mentioned, we should not try to have all institutional monitoring done by Federal officials. We need help from the market, and the best helpers in the market are the debt holders. Unfortunately, we have now undertaken a program where the FDIC is guaranteeing 100 percent of almost all debt for 10 years--not only of banks and thrifts, but also of their holding companies. Please note that thrift holding companies include General Motors and General Electric. By these broad guarantees, we have created a moral hazard. We have eliminated the people in the market who are most likely to help us police these institutions--the large debt holders of these institutions. Last, I think we do want to make sure that we are looking at institutions across the board and not just ones that have Federal charters. One category of institution with potential systemic risk is very large insurance companies which are regulated by the States. We also have the very large mortgage lenders, which under last summer's act are licensed by the States. Those are two areas where we should think about whether a few very large institutions might come under a Federal regulator. My last point is that we should not try to form a new Bretton Woods, whatever that means. We have a hard enough time, as you know, getting everyone in the Senate to agree on legislation. Since the chance of getting all major countries to agree on a new international institution is remote, we should not spend a long time waiting for this to happen. What should we do here in the United States? I am personally quite skeptical about the consolidation of all financial agencies into one. We did not see a lot of benefit from the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in the United Kingdom, a consolidated regulator, in terms of preventing a financial crisis. These consolidations of agencies have as many problems as they do benefits. As Mr. Litan pointed out, you do not want too many cooks. You want one person or agency with responsibility for each financial service. Also, you want an agency that is pretty nimble. If it is a big bureaucracy with lots of different divisions, it is hard to move quickly. I tend to think that the Federal Reserve is the right agency to be the monitor of systemic risks. It has a lot of experience in keeping tabs on macroeconomic trends. I also agree with Mr. Litan's point that the Federal Reserve has been acting as a consumer protection agency in the mortgage disclosure area. It is not a function that fits in very well with what the Federal Reserve does. Quite frankly, the Federal Reserve did not do a very good job in that area, so I would tend to move that function to another agency. According to Federal Reserve officials, their jurisdiction over banks and bank holding companies helps them understand risk and other financial issues. So I would leave that jurisdiction with the Federal Reserve. My model, which I outline in my written testimony, is that the Federal Reserve would be the central risk regulator. The buck stops there. But it would not be the primary regulator of all large financial institutions. We would leave that to the functional regulators for several reasons. First, I do not want to identify these systemically risky institutions because then everybody will want to become one. This could pose an antitrust problem. Institutions will want to merge so that they can become too big to fail. If you are systemically monitored and you are labelled that way, then everyone will feel you will never be allowed to fail and act accordingly. Second, I think the functional regulators know a lot more about their areas than the Federal Reserve does. For instance, in my view, large hedge funds should be registered with the SEC, which should inspect their books and have them file reports. But the SEC should funnel information to the Federal Reserve that relates to macro risks. And so I see us as having a lot of functional regulators feeding information to the Federal Reserve, and the Federal Reserve with the job of putting it all together. I would not start a new agency just to monitor systemic risk. To start a new bureaucracy takes a lot of time and effort. I think the Federal Reserve, if it lost its mortgage disclosure function, is the appropriate agency to monitor systemic risks. It would have to develop more expertise in capital markets, but it would be sent information by all the functional agencies with their experts. Then, if the Federal Reserve decided action needed to be taken to reduce the potential for a systemic failure, it would not just act itself. It would go back and consult with the primary regulator, the SEC, the insurance regulator, or the FDIC, so we would get a combined effort. You really would not want the Federal Reserve acting alone on systemic risk without the knowledge or expertise of the relevant functional agency. So that is my recommended approach. I guess my approach is roughly between those of the prior two speakers. It is making the buck stop with the Federal Reserve, but setting up a system by which it relies on inputs from all the functional regulators. This approach would produce some of the benefits of coordination that Mr. Silbers was advocating."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks. It is very interesting, and very helpful. We will have 7-minute rounds of questions. I find your term, central risk regulator, to be more comfortable than the systemic risk regulator. You have said, Mr. Pozen, in your ideal vision of what should happen here, the Federal Reserve would be the central risk regulator, and Mr. Silvers and Dr. Litan have also spoken about the value of a central risk regulator whether it is a new agency or a college of regulators. I want to understand what this central risk regulator does in your vision of the Federal Reserve playing that role. To go back to my earlier observation, it is different, is it not, from filling the gaps that exist in current regulation?"
"Mr. Pozen","Absolutely."
"Chairman Lieberman","In other words, if credit default swaps in the trillions of dollars or hedge funds in the trillions of dollars are operating essentially unregulated, the systemic regulator or central risk regulator may keep an eye on that, but we need to give somebody else the authority to regulate them."
"Mr. Pozen","I agree with that. Under my approach, there would always be someone else as the primary regulator except for Federal Reserve banks and bank holding companies."
"Chairman Lieberman","What would the Federal Reserve, as a central risk regulator, do?"
"Mr. Pozen","I think the Federal Reserve would focus on the five historic indicators of financial crises outlined in my testimony."
"Chairman Lieberman","So they would watch out for those."
"Mr. Pozen","Yes, they would look to see which products or which institutions were growing very rapidly."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Pozen","They would look to see what financial firms had very high leverage ratios. They would look to see whether any sort of financing bubbles are being created. And I am sure if they look carefully at the history of financial crises, they would wind up with 10 more concrete indicators of what factors are likely to cause a financial crisis. Those are the areas where they ought to focus. Further, it seems to me, it would be part of the Federal Reserve's job to point out where gaps exist and to request that gaps be filled in the regulatory structure."
"Chairman Lieberman","OK."
"Mr. Pozen","They would not be the ones to fill them, but they would say: OK, we have this new product. It is a credit default swap. The New York State Insurance Department has declared it is not an insurance contract, but it is growing very quickly. It is very important. It really should not be regulated by the States. It should be regulated by some Federal agency. We call on Congress to fill this gap."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes."
"Mr. Pozen","And that would be a second important function."
"Chairman Lieberman","So, right now, the Federal Reserve is not carrying out that kind of central risk regulation oversight function, not asking the kinds of questions that you and the others think should be asked as what might be called early warnings of coming broad-scale failure."
"Mr. Pozen","Yes. I think, unfortunately, the Federal Reserve tends to get involved when the failure is upon us."
"Mr. Silvers","When the horse is out of the barn."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right. Does it have the authority now in statute to perform that central risk regulation?"
"Mr. Pozen","I do not think it really does."
"Chairman Lieberman","So that would be something we would need to do."
"Mr. Pozen","It has broad authority relative to bank holding companies."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Pozen","But it really does not have authority as a general risk monitor. It can cooperate with the other agencies, but they are not under an obligation to give the Federal Reserve information on a regular basis."
"Chairman Lieberman","Of course, if the Federal Reserve is not performing that central risk regulating role, no other institution is either."
"Mr. Pozen","That is true, and I think that the Federal Reserve probably would need to broaden its capabilities. There are certain areas where the Federal Reserve is very strong, say, in macroeconomic analysis. Becoming a general monitor of systemic risks would require that the Federal Reserve become more sophisticated in capital markets."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Pozen","As I say, while the Federal Reserve has acted in part as a consumer protection agency, this seems out of sync with its core functions."
"Chairman Lieberman","I agree."
"Mr. Pozen","So we ought to think carefully. There may be other functions that should be taken out of the Federal Reserve's mandate."
"Chairman Lieberman","Taken away, yes."
"Mr. Pozen","And so, the Federal Reserve ought to be a bank regulator and a central risk monitor."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes. In a way, you are answering the concern that some like former Treasury Secretary Paul Volcker have expressed, that if we put this function--central risk regulator, early warning, etc.--on the Federal Reserve, we may be overloading it. But you are saying, take some of what it is doing now away from it because it is less urgent."
"Mr. Pozen","I think it is not only less urgent, it is a consumer protection function. As I am sure Mr. Silvers would agree, consumer protection should be the main focus of an agency. If you tell an agency, you have to be a prudential regulator and you have to also look after consumer protection, consumer protection tends to get subordinated and solvency takes precedence. Whether it is the SEC, the FTC, or some other agency, investor protection and consumer protection need to be placed with an agency where that is their main mandate."
"Chairman Lieberman","Mr. Silvers and Dr. Litan, is there general agreement on what the systemic or central risk regulator should be doing? I know there is disagreement on who should do it among you. But do you agree that it is to ask the kinds of early warning questions that Mr. Pozen has described?"
"Mr. Silvers","Mr. Chairman, I would sort of unpack that a little bit more, I would guess."
"Chairman Lieberman","Go ahead."
"Mr. Silvers","Well, two points. One is that I think our history of our existing regulatory bodies, including the Federal Reserve and particularly the Federal Reserve, at performing that early warning function has not been very good. In our report, we recommend essentially a body of nongovernmental experts, academics, people like my colleagues on this panel not embedded in the daily to and fro, who would play that kind of reconnaissance function. That recommendation from the Congressional Oversight Panel, I think is in large part based on the actual track record of the Federal Reserve and, to a lesser degree, the other agencies."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is very interesting. And that is different from the college of regulators?"
"Mr. Silvers","Yes. That is a different panel. It is not something with significant staff. Its sole purpose is to have a check outside the regulatory processes and the political processes, intellectually."
"Mr. Pozen","I think it is an interesting idea. It is like an advisory commission to the Pentagon, as we now have in defense."
"Mr. Silvers","Well, precisely."
"Mr. Pozen","I think it is very consistent with having the Federal Reserve as the central risk monitor. This would be a group that would act as an idea generator and would keep the Federal Reserve on its toes. It seems like a good proposal."
"Mr. Silvers","In particular, it would issue a mandated report, in our view, to Congress on what is coming over the horizon. Second, Mr. Chairman, this, I am afraid, is influenced by my experience and our experience with respect to TARP, that we looked at the systemic risk regulator as, in part, having this advance warning function but also necessarily being the body that acts when a systemic crisis occurs. And it turns out, of course, we have experienced it when a systemic crisis does occur, that the range of action often turns out to be much more extensive and much more involving public money than we might have thought in advance."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right. I am over my time. But, Dr. Litan, why don't you get into this a moment?"
"Mr. Litan","Yes. So, I have a couple of points. One, the idea of an outside body doing the warning is an interesting idea. It is not mutually exclusive. You can have them and the Federal Reserve do this. So I think that is point one. Point two, in an ideal world, you would like to keep the list of the SIFIs private. As a practical matter, however, the markets will interpret any large institution that, for example, may have larger capital requirements or different liquidity requirements as being a SIFI. It will take the markets about five seconds to figure out that the regulators are treating these institutions differently, and, as a practical matter, the secret will be out. And the last point is the issue that Mr. Pozen has raised and, actually, Mr. Chairman, you raised. Do we agree on exactly what this regulator should do? We all agree that early warning, probably supplemented with some outside advice, but I think there is some disagreement about how much the systemic regulator needs to get into the weeds. So, under one model, let's say Mr. Pozen's model, they delegate, but they are overseeing and they are issuing thunderbolts, if you will. In my model, I am actually having them on the front lines and being involved in the direct supervision of the systemically important institutions. They have the expertise already from supervising large bank holding companies. They would need more staff, I admit. I think you would probably borrow them from the Comptroller and other agencies. But the thing that worries me about the sort of delegation model is that it violates the ``buck stops here'' principle. I worry that the Federal Reserve Chairman will call up the OCC and say, look, you ought to watch Citigroup and certain other large institutions more carefully. And the Comptroller says, I do not agree. And then they argue. That is what happens in the real world. Now not all the time, and it is true that the Federal Reserve Chairman does have a lot of influence. But I have been in government before, at least in the Executive Branch. People have different views about these things. Ultimately, at the end of the day, let's take the Federal Reserve if they are going to be the agency. If they are the ones shelling out the bucks, it seems to me they ought to have the final say on what is going on underneath with the institutions."
"Mr. Silvers","But they are not shelling out the bucks. That is the problem."
"Chairman Lieberman","I will give you a quick response, and we will go to Senator Tester."
"Mr. Pozen","Thanks. First, that would require the Federal Reserve to have deep expertise in six or seven different areas. That is not likely. Second, I think the buck still stops at the Federal Reserve. It just gets information from these other agencies. And, third of all, we do have the President's working group to resolve disputes among financial agencies."
"Mr. Silvers","Senator Lieberman, just one sentence about this: The Federal Reserve is not ultimately shelling out the bucks. The taxpayer is, meaning that when we move to a real systemic crisis, as we have learned through TARP, it is the taxpayer shelling out the bucks. And that is why. That underlies my view that it needs to be a public body."
"Chairman Lieberman","So the question is not only where the buck stops but who is shelling out the bucks."
"Mr. Silvers","Right."
"Chairman Lieberman","OK. Senator Tester, you may have heard a term being used by Dr. Litan, SIFIs. I want to assure you that you arrived at the right hearing, that we are not exploring the world of Dr. Spock. SIFIs, as I have learned this morning, are systemically important financial institutions. With that, it is all yours."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR TESTER",""
"Senator Tester","That is good to know, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that because I was thinking maybe I did not do enough reading last night. I, first of all, apologize for not being here for the beginning of the testimony. I appreciate you being here as always, and I appreciate the Chairman for calling this hearing. As you folks well know, how we get consumer confidence back in the system is going to be critically important and how we do it and do it right is not going to be, at least from my perspective, easy. Let's just talk about the Federal Reserve for a second and follow up on some of the things the Chairman was talking about. If it becomes the major central systemic regulator, is there fear of too much power in one agency?"
"Mr. Pozen","Senator Tester, it is a good question. I would answer that in two ways: First, we were talking--and I am not sure exactly when you came in--about taking some functions away from the Federal Reserve such as consumer protection in the area of mortgage disclosure. This is not central to the Federal Reserve's mission, and perhaps it has not done as good a job as it should have. Second, at least under my model, the Federal Reserve would not be the primary regulator of, say, an investment bank or an insurance company. That would still stay with the functional regulators, who would work closely with the Federal Reserve. Information relating to systemic risk would be channeled to the Federal Reserve from the SEC, the Comptroller of the Currency, etc., and the Federal Reserve would have the ability to get more information from these agencies. By contrast, if we ask the Federal Reserve to be the primary regulator of, say, the 20 largest financial institutions, then it would have a lot of power, and it would have to develop a lot of different kinds of expertise. In my view, you solve the problem of having the Federal Reserve becoming too powerful by following a decentralized approach. I would call it a specialized expertise model. For example, the SEC would spend most of its time on investor protection; it is not focused on systemic risks. But the SEC would pass on risk-related information to the Federal Reserve, which would aggregate it with other data in analyzing systemic risks. The SEC is an investor protection agency, and that is what it does best."
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, I think your concern is well founded, and I think that it is well founded for the following reason: If you ask the Federal Reserve to play this role, you are then asking the Federal Reserve either to take on real power, as I think Mr. Litan would like it to do, or the question becomes what real abilities is this process going to have to achieve the purpose, to actually constrain systemic risk and to act in a crisis. If we give the Federal Reserve real power, then the concern outlined in my testimony comes to the fore, which is that the Federal Reserve is not a fully public body. In particular, the operational arm of the Federal Reserve and the arms of the Federal Reserve in the financial markets, the regional Feds, are both capitalized and governed in part by the very institutions that they regulate. The result of the Federal Reserve not being a completely public institution is that the Federal Reserve is neither fully accountable or transparent to the public. That is not an appropriate structure in which to vest either the kind of broad regulatory powers that are being envisioned here by some of my colleagues on the panel nor is it an appropriate structure to hand over the power to disburse taxpayer funds which is a necessary component of systemic risk regulation when a crisis hits. For that reason, if one wished to vest the Federal Reserve with this type of power, you would have to change its governance pretty significantly, and it is not clear that is a good idea in relation to the Federal Reserve's actual core mission which is monetary policy. Furthermore, I am very influenced by two issues of expertise and information sharing. My colleague, Mr. Pozen, thinks it will be easily handled, but I think it will not. I think if systemic risk management is not collective among the agencies, that information will not be shared in an appropriate way. I think that is just human nature and the nature of matters in Washington. And, second, I think that the expertise in the broader capital markets that Mr. Pozen is convinced can be easily acquired by the Federal Reserve is not actually that easily acquired and, second, would be completely duplicative of expertise resident in the SEC and the CFTC today. Mr. Pozen is correct that the SEC's culture is not a risk management culture. It is a disclosure and fiduciary duty- related culture. But that is why you want to bring these agencies together to conduct this function. The punch line, I would say, though, is that we cannot turn over this type of responsibility, either in terms of power to regulate or in responsibility to regulate and in terms of the ability to expend the taxpayer dollars to an institution that in its ultimate functioning is self-regulatory and not completely publicly accountable. It would be irresponsible to do so."
"Mr. Litan","We do not live in a perfect world. We have all kinds of tradeoffs with these considerations. So, to the point about their governance structure, I think if you give more power to the Federal Reserve you may have to change its structure. For example, if you told the Federal Reserve that it has regulatory responsibility, you could say that part of their activity is subject to the appropriations process and is under congressional oversight. You can leave monetary policy the way it is, where the Federal Reserve gives the money back at the end of the day, assuming it has any these days. But, in any event, you could change the way the Federal Reserve's regulatory activities are conducted. That is point one. Point two, you could rebalance the concentration of power-- for example, by transferring the mortgage or the consumer protection part of the Federal Reserve to other agencies. At the end of the day, and I do not want to exaggerate here, we have had the financial equivalent of a nuclear meltdown. That is what it is. This is a horrific set of circumstances. Frankly, it blows my mind. I would have never expected this 2 years ago if somebody had told me this was going to happen. And God forbid anything like this should happen again. So, at the end of the day, if that is the image that you have in your mind, do you want a committee making the decisions about this or do you want some one agency in charge? I would feel more comfortable if someone was in charge, so at the end of the day, after it all happened, we do not have fingerpointing again, where the Federal Reserve Chairman comes before you and says, I recommended X, Y, and Z to the CFTC and the SEC and the Comptroller, but they did not listen to me. And the Comptroller says, no, we have a difference in views. And then we have fingerpointing. At the end of the day, you, in Congress, want somebody to be held responsible. So, if the magnitude of the problem warrants it, you concentrate the power, and then you subject it to oversight to solve the transparency problem. That is my view."
"Senator Tester","Can I keep going?"
"Chairman Lieberman","Go right ahead."
"Senator Tester","All right. The thought occurred to me as each of the three of you were speaking that we have a Committee here of 17 members, and the Banking Committee has the same kind of committee, and I wondered if you three could get together and could come up with a program that would work because it is going to be five times more difficult for us, plus with a lot less expertise. Consumer protection versus systemic regulation, are they exclusive to one another? For instance, good central systemic regulation, is that good for consumers? Is that good for consumer protection? Does one fit the other's needs and vice versa?"
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, I think there are many ironies built into the answer to your question. The first irony is that I think it is hard to read the record of the Federal Reserve's oversight of the mortgage markets and not conclude that the Federal Reserve felt that consumer protection was an afterthought, and it turned out that without effective consumer protection there was no effective systemic risk management. Things ran exactly the opposite to what the assumption was. I think the lesson from this--I think Mr. Pozen talked about this a few moments ago, and I absolutely agree with him-- is that there is a tension between not so much systemic risk management properly construed but what it often turns into, which is the desire to protect the safety and soundness of particular institutions. There is a tension between that and consumer protection in real life. I think everyone who has been in this area knows that typically bank regulators are safety and soundness focused, as they should be. The safety and soundness mission is quite important. But the result when you put those two missions together is that you get neither. You get neither effective consumer protection nor effective safety and soundness regulation. For that reason among others, the Congressional Oversight Panel recommended a separate consumer protection regulator. Now there are several options built into the report. I would make clear my view is that consumer protection in the financial markets needs to be separated from the safety and soundness mission entirely. Then the question is where does it go? It could be a distinct agency. It could be the Federal Trade Commission which has consumer protection responsibilities. It could be the SEC. There is a caveat to the SEC. I am an extremely strong supporter of that institution and believe it needs to be revived and strengthened. However, its conception of its mission is heavily oriented toward disclosure and toward fiduciary duties. It is not a substantive regulator of the fairness of the markets it regulates. Consumer financial services--mortgages, insurance, insured bank accounts, credit cards--are areas that I think pretty obviously need substantive oversight. It is not clear that the culture needed matches the SEC's culture and mission. But the larger point that consumer protection and investor protection need agencies focused on those missions is exactly right, and I hope if we learn one lesson from this meltdown that Mr. Litan described it is that if you do not get that mission right, you are very likely to get these larger systemic missions wrong as well."
"Mr. Pozen","I think the short answer is that they are related and that the breakdown of one can lead to a breakdown of the other. However, as a matter of regulatory strategy, I strongly agree with Mr. Silvers that we probably want to take the consumer protection functions out of the Federal Reserve, put them in an agency where that is the main focus, and then the Federal Reserve will concentrate on solvency and other aspects of systemic risk. That seems to be the way to go."
"Mr. Litan","And I agree entirely with what Mr. Silvers said. In an ideal world, or even less than an ideal world, I would consolidate the SEC with something like a FTC to melt down these cultures. I just want to make one additional point. In my professional life, I am sort of bicoastal. I live in Kansas City, but I am also affiliated with the Brookings Institution. So I am here on the East Coast a lot. Aside from the disadvantage of traveling on airplanes, the advantage of being bicoastal is that I get to live in the Heartland and hear real people most of the week, and it has been good. I will tell you one of the things I have heard from traveling around the country, and I am sure that you too, when you go back to your home districts, hear this. The public is not only furious, the public has no confidence in our regulatory system. When I talk to groups about how to try to fix this and reorganize the government, at the end of the day, I want to tell you that I think we have an unbelievably skeptical public about the ability of regulation to fix the financial system. So that whatever we do, wherever we lodge the power, we have a huge uphill road to climb with the public. And what really has sent people over the edge is the Bernie Madoff affair. People all over America are asking: How could something like this happen in the United States? And so, in addition to your point about the culture of the SEC being different from the others and how we have to change the culture there, we also have to convince a very skeptical public right now that there is a fix out there that will work."
"Senator Tester","I will just tell you I hear the same exact thing, and I, quite frankly, am just as frustrated and just as furious as they are. Whether you are talking about Mr. Madoff or whether you are talking about how some of those TARP funds were used. We will just leave it at the fact that things are not running smoothly at this point in time. I think they will be fixed. I think it is just a matter of time and getting some common-sense regulation. But what is good for consumer protection, I heard you guys say, is also good for systemic regulation, and that is important. I do have some other questions, but I will wait for another round. Thanks, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator Tester. Senator Tester is one of, I think, two Members of this Committee who is also on the Banking Committee. So that is an important overlap. I agree with you. I hear the same thing at home. Even though the Madoff scandal is not, at its heart, relevant to or the same as the housing bubble, the credit default swaps, etc., it does connect to the critical point of whether there was a fiscal cop on the beat. How could this guy get away with this Ponzi scheme particularly when we now have this gentleman who seemed to have been trying to get the SEC to investigate for years? So this work is urgent. I know that the President hopes to at least have an outline of a proposal before he goes to London in early April. But it is critical now in terms of the confidence without which the economy will not recover. Senator Burris, thanks for being here. We turn to you now."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BURRIS",""
"Senator Burris","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I certainly have gone through the testimony of the witnesses even though I was not here to listen to them. Being an old banker and a part of some of that system during my younger days, I am just wondering, where did we lose control of this situation? You have the FDIC, the Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC, all of these regulators. Was it turf that started some of this or nobody ending up with complete oversight and authority for something like this to happen? When we got rid of Glass-Steagall, the banks started using all types of different instruments and insurance and all these other things. Where did we lose control for the systemic problem to come in?"
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, there are probably as many answers as there are hours in the day to that question, but let me give you a couple of thoughts that you may be surprised by. One thing that is quite striking right now as we look at the crisis of our mega-institutions is how few actual bankers you find running them. When you start asking, well, who is in charge here? Where are the people who know about underwriting loans? The sort of old-fashioned bankers?"
"Senator Burris","Which I was, an old-fashioned banker."
"Mr. Silvers","They are hard to find, and that, I think, tells us something fairly deep. I will take it one step further. We moved very dramatically over the last 30 years, and you can see it in all kinds of statistics about where financial assets are, away from banking and institutions and toward markets, toward derivatives markets, toward securitization markets and so forth. There are a number of advantages to having done that, but it is hard not to look at what has happened and also see that there have been some profound disadvantages to that, including, and I think the Chairman referred to this in his opening remarks, the lack of skin in the game, in securitizations, for example. There is a deep belief among many academics that markets are extraordinarily good at capturing information and making decisions about things like risk. It is a little unclear to me, looking at this landscape and this history, as to whether that is really true in relationship to the old-fashioned kind of banking activity that you were just describing. Second, with respect to regulators and where did we lose control on a regulatory basis, I think several big bad ideas got going. One big bad idea that I refer to in my written testimony goes back into the 1970s, which is the notion that financial regulation is about protecting the weak, so that basically we look very heavily at how essentially poor people are treated and consumers are treated, but we do not look very much at large, sophisticated actors because we figure they can take care of themselves. That idea, and I am not in any way at all against consumer protection or against measures for the weak, but the idea that we let the strong do whatever they want turns out to be exactly what produces a systemic catastrophe. It also fed this notion of regulatory loopholes, regulatory holes in our system. Then, finally, I would just observe that it is very clear that the place where the breakthrough really took off, the moment in time when we really let our credit systems run loose was in the very early part of this decade. It is what I would call essentially idiot Keynesism. Policy decisions were made to stimulate our economy through individual borrowing rather than intelligent Keynesism which is what I think Congress and the President are engaged in today. That is an unsustainable move, idiot Keynesism. You cannot stimulate an economy through lending money to people who cannot pay it back. I would finally note, and I think this will not surprise you now, coming from an employee of the labor movement, that ultimately the decision to try to have a high consumption, low wage society was a prelude to disaster and that we tried to make up the gap through credit, and it is not a sustainable strategy."
"Mr. Pozen","Let me just take up one aspect of what Mr. Silvers said because it has not been focused on that much."
"Senator Burris","Sure."
"Mr. Pozen","I personally was recruited to serve as an outside director of two large banking institutions, and I was shocked by how little expertise there was on those boards. In the end, regulators can only do so much. The day to day, month to month work must be done by boards. But if you look at a lot of bank boards, you really have to question whether they have enough financial expertise to deal with these very complex institutions. You can argue that if somebody does not really know much about banking, then they may be very independent. But is that the type of director we want for large banks? In the end, I could not be a permanent member of those boards because I had a potential conflict of interest. So we have a lot of very distinguished people on bank boards, who spend one day every other month for a total of 6 days a year. They are not banking experts, and these are very complex institutions. They do not seem to have known very much about the significant risks taken by these institutions. I would suggest that there is a different model of a board of directors, which you see in companies that are owned by private equity funds. These boards have five or six directors, not 12 or 14. Almost all those directors are retired executives from the relevant industries, and they spend 3 to 4 days a month at the company. Also, their compensation is structured differently--low base salaries with significant stock options. Those directors really care about what happens to that institution. They have the time, the expertise, and the financial incentive. So, in my view, we should consider a different model for corporate governance. I cannot address all types of companies, but for large and complex financial institutions, you really need a different board structure. This is one of the subjects that has not been focused on yet. Look at the Citigroup board, filled with distinguished people. But where was the audit committee when all these risky deals and practices were happening? The directors followed all the rules in the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. They were all independent. So there are limits to a procedural approach to governance. But the directors of Citigroup, as opposed to a private equity board, were not experts on financial institutions. They did not spend a lot of time on company business, and they did not have sufficient financial incentives aligned with the shareholders. We do not have to ask whether a chief executive officer (CEO) from a company controlled by private equity received a golden parachute when he or she was fired for doing a poor job. It has never happened, and it probably never will happen. If we had the right board of directors, it would not have happened at these financial institutions."
"Mr. Litan","Senator, just a few extra things because we could go on, as Mr. Silvers said, forever. You know lawyers frequently describe what are called but- for-causes of accidents. But for X, Y, or Z, it would not have happened. In all the tomes that are going to be written about this financial crisis, there are lots of but-for-causes, and we have heard just some examples. I am going to give you my top three. All right? If you look at the subprime numbers, they went off the charts in 2004, 2005, and 2006."
"Chairman Lieberman","What do you mean by subprime numbers? You mean the number of subprime mortgages?"
"Mr. Litan","The number and the volume of securitizations, they went through the roof in those years. If we could have replayed history and notwithstanding that we have State mortgage brokers--if we had minimum standards for mortgage origination that would have prevented no documentation loans, no income loans, and loans to people without any down payment, a huge amount of the subprime explosion would have never happened. That is point one. Second, there was gasoline all over the floor of the financial system in the form of excessive leverage. That was what I think both Mr. Silvers and Mr. Pozen have talked about. So that when the mortgages blew up, they ignited the fire, and the fire was fed by the leverage. Part of it was the SEC liberalized the rules on the securities companies and, in particular, allowed them to fund their assets with too much short-term money, which proved to be highly destabilizing. The government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs) also were way under-capitalized, and now we saw what happened to them. So the second thing is that our key financial institutions did not have enough skin in the game. And the final point relates to credit default swaps. Part of the reason investors thought subprime securities were safe is that they were backed by bond insurance or you could buy a credit default swap to cover risk of default. As it turned out, however, the bond insurers were asleep. The ratings agencies also were asleep because they all had their models based on a few years, not on any long historical period. And the credit default swap market is basically an insurance market that was unregulated, and we allowed dealers to write contracts with not enough money in the till to pay it back when the bills came due. Now we, the taxpayers, are paying all those bills. I honestly believe even with all the other problems that Mr. Pozen and Mr. Silvers have talked about I think we would have escaped a good portion of this disaster if we had addressed these three items."
"Senator Burris","Mr. Chairman, we have to leave shortly. So I have a lot more questions, but I will yield at this point, and hopefully we can continue this at some other time."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Senator. This has been a great panel, both in your individual ideas and in the back and forth between you. Maybe we will see if we can do a final round if the three of us want to stay at 5 minutes each, and we will get out of here hopefully in time to get to Prime Minister Brown. You have all convinced me that we do need a systemic risk regulator or a central risk regulator in some sense. Depending on your model, it may not be a regulator. It is a kind of financial system overseer in the sense of advance warning. We are holding this hearing pursuant to the traditional Governmental Affairs jurisdiction of this Committee. In the last 5 years, we received a new jurisdiction, Homeland Security. And I go back to, Dr. Litan, your reference to what we are experiencing now as a financial meltdown comparable to a nuclear meltdown. There are, to me, as I listen to your testimony, stunning comparisons to the work we did after September 11, 2001, which led to the creation of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and, an even better example, the Director of National Intelligence (DNI). Because what were we saying after September There was nowhere where the dots could be connected. If this agency of the Federal Government had shared what it knew with this agency and that agency, I tell you in the end I concluded from all I have seen that we could have prevented September 11, 2001. But they were not. So, in a way, it is that, but it is also putting somebody up on top, looking out over the horizon, constantly asking the question: Are we seeing something here that is really troublesome that could lead to a major economic crisis or system failure? You have convinced me of that, but there remain important questions for all of us. Who does it? What are the kinds of authorities that group has? But now I come to the other part of this, and let's just go to the final part of your last answer, Dr. Litan. We know that there were certain kinds of economic activity that were extremely consequential that were simply not regulated. Credit default swaps are one. Hedge funds are another. So I want to ask you for a quick answer. I have spoken too long now. A central risk regulator is not enough of a reform to avoid a repeat of this mess we are in here. I presume we need to regulate some of the activity, like the credit default swaps, that brought the house down. And I want to ask you quickly if I am right and just quickly, if so, who should do this? Who should oversee credit default swaps or hedge funds or anything else you think contributed to this?"
"Mr. Litan","So, shortly, I talk about credit default swaps in my testimony."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Litan","As much as I want the Federal Reserve to be on the front lines of the so-called SIFIs, I am not confident that they are the best regulator of credit default swaps or any derivatives market. I still see a role for the SEC or the CFTC directly overseeing that. People are talking about clearinghouses now being formed which will reduce the risk, but you have to regulate the clearinghouse. You have to make sure it is solvent."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes."
"Mr. Litan","And then you have all these customized contracts which will not be cleared. What do you do about them? I think maybe one way to do this, and I am not necessarily advocating it, is to have the Federal Reserve overseeing all this, getting the relevant information from the agencies. But to satisfy my desire that there be some teeth, you could give the Federal Reserve the authority so that if it walked in and said, look, Citigroup is not doing the right thing or there is a section of the market that needs to be looked at or whatever, the Federal Reserve could at least do something on its own initiative and not just be stuck with calling on the phone and saying, please will you do this? That worries me."
"Mr. Silvers","Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes, I was going to ask the two of you, quickly. What about derivatives markets that are unregulated, hedge funds, etc.? Is that the SEC or the CFTC that we should give that to by statute?"
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, my view is that what President Obama said at Cooper Union during the campaign is the right answer, conceptually. Things should be regulated for what they are, not what they are called. Those derivatives that are based on securities, where the underlying instrument is a security, need to be under the jurisdiction of the SEC or a merged SEC and CFTC. Those derivatives that are effectively insurance need to be regulated like insurance. It does not mean that they need to be regulated exactly the same as an insurance policy but the same capital requirements notions and the same review as to whether they do what they say they do needs to be done. With respect to hedge funds, it is clearly something that ought to be under the SEC. A hedge fund is nothing but a money manager, and it needs to be there. If the hedge fund is engaged in activity that substantively is insurance, for example, by selling a credit default swap, then it needs to be regulated as if it is selling insurance--again, not exactly like an insurance company but with those principles in mind. And I think that is Mr. Pozen's point about somebody has to be watching the safety and soundness of whoever is doing this."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is helpful. Mr. Pozen, a last word?"
"Mr. Pozen","I agree that the SEC should regulate hedge funds, and the merged SEC and CFTC, which I agree should happen, should regulate hedge funds and credit default swaps. I just add one more point. One of the great accomplishments of the 1975 Securities Act amendment was to merge the back offices of all the securities exchanges into the Depository Trust Company (DTC) and one clearing corporation. There was a complicated tradeoff between antitrust considerations and operating efficiencies in the public interest. We have lots of groups now who want to be the central clearing agency for credit default swaps, so many that there is a lot of in-fighting. In my view, it would be great to have one clearing agency for the whole world of swaps; or at least, one for the United States and one for Europe. If we have a lot more, we are losing a lot of the benefits of a clearing corporation. We should look at the national market legislation of 1975 and see whether we can pass a similar bill creating one central clearing house for CDS. We do not really want people competing on the back office."
"Chairman Lieberman","Good. Thank you. Senator Tester."
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The comments about the subprime and the no documentation and the low documentation loans are something that is interesting to me because I cannot imagine people lending money with no documentation unless you can sell it to somebody who does not know there is no documentation there, which is exactly what happened. Are there any provisions? You will have to be concise with your answers because we just have a limited amount of time. Are there any provisions with Gramm-Leach-Bliley that we need to revisit? And if you can be as concise as possible, it would be great."
"Mr. Litan","I do not think so and this is where I disagree with Mr. Silvers. I do not think Gramm-Leach-Bliley contributed to this, Senator Tester. And the very simple point that we had commercial banks and investment banks that were not affiliated with each other that went over the edge by themselves. It was not the fact that they got merged together that allowed this. I think it would have happened anyhow."
"Senator Tester","We will get to that in another question later."
"Mr. Silvers","As my written testimony suggests, I think there is a basic problem with the world Gramm-Leach-Bliley created, which is that you have institutions that have large regulated, insured businesses and large unregulated, uninsured businesses, and they interact with each other unavoidably. That is an unsustainable situation."
"Senator Tester","So Gramm-Leach-Bliley needs to be changed in that particular area?"
"Mr. Silvers","I think that we need to decide whether we wish to basically really rein in our investment banks in a pretty heavy way, recognizing that under Gramm-Leach-Bliley they have all become bank holding companies, or that we want to have them run pretty aggressively and separately from insured deposits."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Pozen","I think that is a separate complex issue. To eliminate no documentation loans sold to the secondary market, Congress should amend the law that was passed last summer for the registration of mortgage lenders. They are still left mainly to the oversight of the States. We need a stronger Federal presence in mortgage lending. And we need a very simple rule: You cannot sell more than 90 percent of any loan into the secondary market."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Pozen","If sellers were required to hold on to 10 percent of the loan, they would care more about the soundness of that loan. Not just the documents; they would care whether actually the borrower could pay."
"Mr. Litan","All three of us agree on that issue."
"Senator Tester","We have a situation right now where we have--I do not know--I think there are 17 banks that are too big to fail. Maybe more than that?"
"Mr. Pozen","Who knows?"
"Senator Tester","The question for me becomes if they are too big to fail and at some point in time the money is going to run out, what do we do about that, long-term?"
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, do you mean what do we do about the fact that there are banks that are too big to fail or what do we do about the fact that some of them are unstable right now?"
"Senator Tester","Well, both. I mean because I think anytime you have a situation where you are too big to fail that means you cannot fail. That means that is an inherent problem. If you are too big to fail, you have a problem."
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, in the Congressional Oversight Panel's report, one of the reasons we recommended that you not identify who is too big to fail and who is not is so that you can have a continuous ratchet process around your capital requirements and your insurance costs that make it more and more expensive to be too big to fail. The result would be to encourage less too big to fail institutions. The question of what do we do with the ones that are sick right now is that we need to take whatever steps are necessary to get them back to life in a way that is responsible with the taxpayers' money because we have a situation now where the four largest banks have more than 50 percent of the lending ability and they are paralyzed."
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Litan","So I agree with Mr. Silvers that there ought to be higher capital charges progressively for larger institutions. Ditto for liquidity. That would introduce a penalty, if you will, for getting too large, and is it appropriately so because they visit costs on the rest of the system so that they ought to pay for it. The only area where I disagree, and I have said this before, is that once you introduce that system, given the disclosure requirements we have, everyone will know who these institutions are and you will not be able to keep it secret."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Pozen","Can I just add one more thing?"
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Pozen","You should realize that our merger and acquisition policy now is creating more institutions that are too big to fail. We have been encouraging mergers and acquisitions among banks. Although Bank of America was too big before, we have now made it even bigger with Merrill Lynch. If Bank of America was too big to fail before, it is now much too big to fail. We are also guaranteeing the debt of most banks."
"Senator Tester","Trust me. That is the whole problem. But what do we need to do to stop it?"
"Mr. Pozen","I think the first thing we should do is start guaranteeing only 90 percent of the debt of all these banks and related institutions; investors should hang on to a little risk. We want the big bond-holders at these banks, thrifts, and holding companies to help us police the financial situation and managerial quality of these institutions. We tell any bank, you issue a billion dollars of debt and whoever owns it, it is 100 percent insured by the Federal Government, then the bond holders will not care who is running the bank or how it is being run."
"Mr. Litan","I just want to be clear on the debt. I think Mr. Pozen and I agree on this, that it is really the long-term debt where we want people to be on the hook. I think it is impractical in my own view to say that for deposits."
"Mr. Pozen","Yes, I agree."
"Mr. Litan","So we are talking about long-term."
"Mr. Pozen","We are now out to 10 years."
"Senator Tester","I understand that."
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, there is one final point about this, though. If you say here are five banks or here are 20 banks, and they are the systemically significant ones, what happens when the one right outside the list fails? In a situation like we have today, in a crisis, it will turn out that somebody you thought was actually not systemically significant is systemically significant. Witness Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers. You want to have a system that everybody is in, where that bright line does not become so important. And, second, if you follow the logic of what my two co- panelists said about who in the capital structure needs to be held responsible when things go wrong, the clear implication of that is that we obviously are insuring depositors. We have effectively insured commercial paper and the money markets that commercial paper backs up, but there are very powerful reasons why we should not be insuring long-term debt holders and particularly not equity holders. And there is absolutely no way to square that with how we have actually treated the stockholders and long-term bond holders of Citibank, Bank of America, and others."
"Senator Tester","Well, thank you all for being here. We could have this discussion well into the evening. So, thank you very much."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you, Senator Tester. Great questions. You have been a wonderful panel. I am just thinking, going to Prime Minister Brown now, you have basically said that it is not time for another Bretton Woods series of agreements and we cannot wait here in the United States. We have to take action ourselves. There is too much at risk for us, for our economy, and the truth is if we right ourselves it will help to right the rest of the world. Sometime we will have you back when we have more time to ask what, if anything, you think the United States should be doing to connect to the rest of the world since obviously part of the reality we are living in is a remarkably global financial system. But no time for that today. In terms of time, we are going to keep the record of the hearing open for 15 days if you want to supplement your testimony in any way or if Members of the Committee who were here or not here want to submit questions to you to be answered for the record. I thank you a lot. You have really helped, I say for myself, educate me and clarify some questions. In the end, Senator Collins and my hope is that we will make a recommendation to our colleagues on the Banking Committee, essentially a recommended reorganizational chart with some descriptions underneath about what powers we think different elements of the financial regulatory system need to have to prevent a recurrence of what we are going through now. With that, I thank you all very much, and the hearing is adjourned."
"WHERE WERE THE WATCHDOGS? FINANCIAL REGULATORY LESSONS FROM ABROAD THURSDAY, MAY 21, 2009"," U.S. Senate, Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, Washington, DC. The Committee met, pursuant to notice, at 2:03 p.m., in room SD-342, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Hon. Joseph I. Lieberman, Chairman of the Committee, presiding. Present: Senators Lieberman, McCaskill, and Collins."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN LIEBERMAN",""
"Chairman Lieberman","The hearing will come to order. Good afternoon, and a special welcome to our guests, three of whom have come from farther than normal to testify--and without being summoned here by force of law, I might add. So we are particularly grateful that you are here. This is our Committee's third in a series of hearings examining the structure of our financial regulatory system; how that flawed structure contributed to the system's failure to anticipate and prevent the current economic crisis; and, most importantly, looking forward, what kind of structure is needed to strengthen financial oversight. You will note that I used the word ``structure'' at least three times here, and this is because that is the unique function and jurisdiction that our Committee has. We understand that the Banking Committee in particular is leading the effort to review regulations in this field, but we are charged with the responsibility to oversee the organization of government, and we have tried to come at this matter of financial regulatory reform with a focus on that as opposed to the particular regulations. We learned from our previous hearings that our current regulatory system has evolved in a haphazard manner, not just over the 10, 20, or 30 years some of us have been here, but over the last 150 years, largely in response usually to whatever the latest crisis was to hit our Nation and threaten its financial stability. As a result, we have here a financial regulatory system that is both fragmented and outdated. Numerous Federal and State agencies share responsibility for regulating financial institutions and markets, creating both redundancies in some ways and gaps in others--gaps particularly over significant activities and businesses, and redundancies, too, such as consumer protection enforcement, hedge funds, and credit default swaps. Our current crisis has clearly exposed many of these problems. To strengthen our financial regulatory system, an array of interested parties--academics, policymakers, even business people--from across the political spectrum has called for significant structural reorganization. So as we move forward and consider this question, it seemed to Senator Collins and me that it would be very helpful for us to examine the experiences of other nations around the world, and that is the purpose of today's hearing and why we are so grateful to the four of you. Over the past few years, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries have dramatically reformed their financial regulatory systems. They have merged agencies, reconsidered their fundamental approaches to regulation, and streamlined their regulatory structures. Many people believe that these reforms have resulted in a more efficient and effective use of regulatory resources and certainly more clearly defined roles for regulators. The American economy is different in size, of course, and in scope from all the others, but there is still much we can learn by studying the examples of these free market partners of ours. We really have an impressive panel of witnesses today, each of whom has not only thought extensively about the different ways in which a country can structure its financial regulatory system, but also played a role in that system. And I would imagine that you all bear some scars from trying to change the regulatory status quo. I would also imagine that you know what we have learned here, that reorganizations are complicated and very difficult. Our Committee learned this firsthand through its role in creating and overseeing the Department of Homeland Security and in reforming our Nation's intelligence community in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But reorganizations can also pay dividends and result in a more effective, responsive, efficient, and transparent government, and of course, that is what we hope for in the area of financial regulation. I am confident in the work that our colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee are doing to address the financial regulations, but as I said at the outset, we are focused here on structure, and the two are clearly tightly interwoven. If we want to minimize the likelihood of severe financial crises in the future, we need to both reform our regulations and improve the architecture of our financial regulators. As Treasury Secretary Geithner and the Obama Administration prepare to announce their own plan for comprehensive reform in the weeks ahead, the testimony presented here today will help ensure that we are cognizant of what has and has not worked abroad, and that surely can help us guide our efforts and the Administration's and clarify for us all which reforms, regulatory and structural, will work best here in the United States of America."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS",""
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, this is the third in a series of hearings held by our Committee to examine America's financial crisis, and I commend you for your leadership in convening this series of hearings because I believe that until we reform our financial regulatory system, we are not going to address some of the root causes of the current financial crisis. Our prior hearings have reviewed the causes of the crisis and whether a systemic risk regulator and other reforms might have helped prevent it. Testimony at these hearings has demonstrated that, for the most part, financial regulators in our country failed to foresee the coming financial meltdown. No one regulator was responsible for the oversight of all the sectors of our financial market, and none of our regulators alone could have taken comprehensive, decisive action to prevent or mitigate the impact of the collapse. These oversight gaps and the lack of attention to systemic risk undermined our financial markets. Congress, working with the Administration, must act to help put in place regulatory reforms to help prevent future meltdowns like this one. Based on our prior hearings and after consulting with a wide range of financial experts, in March, I introduced the Financial System Stabilization and Reform Act. This bill would establish a Financial Stability Council that would be charged with identifying and taking action to prevent or mitigate systemic threats to our financial markets. The council would help to ensure that high-risk financial products and practices could be detected in time to prevent their contagion from spreading to otherwise healthy financial institutions and markets. This legislation would fundamentally restructure our financial regulatory system, help restore stability to our markets, and begin to rebuild the public confidence in our economy. The concept of a council to assess overall systemic risk has garnered support from within the financial regulatory community. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Schapiro, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Sheila Bair are among those who support creating some form of a systemic risk council in order to avoid an excessive concentration of power in any one financial regulator, yet take advantage of the expertise of all the financial regulators. As we continue to search for solutions to this economic crisis, it is instructive for us to look outside our borders at the financial systems of other nations. The distinguished panel of witnesses that we will hear from today will testify about the financial regulatory systems of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. They will also provide a broader view of global financial structures. We can learn some valuable lessons from studying their best practices. Canada's banking system, for example, has been ranked as the strongest in the world, while ours is ranked only as number 40. I am very pleased that Edmund Clark has joined the other experts at the panel. It was through a meeting in my office when he started describing the differences between the Canadian system of regulation, financial practices, and mortgage practices versus our system that I became very interested in having him share his expertise officially, and I am grateful that he was able to change his schedule to be here on relatively short notice. I am also looking forward to hearing from the other experts that we have convened here today. America's Main Street small businesses, homeowners, employees, savers, and investors deserve the protection of an effective regulatory system that modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and soundness requirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive risk taking, and improves oversight, accountability, and transparency. This Committee's ongoing investigation will continue to shed light on how the current crisis evolved and focus attention on the reforms that are needed in the structure and regulatory apparatus to restore the confidence of the American people in our financial system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you, Senator Collins. Thanks for that thoughtful statement. Let us go to the witnesses now. First we welcome David Green, who was Head of International Policy at the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (FSA) after having previously spent three decades at the Bank of England. Mr. Green currently works for England's Financial Reporting Council. It is an honor to have you here, and we would invite your testimony now."
"TESTIMONY OF DAVID W. GREEN,\1\ FORMER HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL POLICY, FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY, UNITED KINGDOM",""
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Chairman. I give testimony, of course, as a private individual, having worked in those institutions you described. I also give testimony as a co- author with Sir Howard Davies of a book on global financial regulation which discusses a lot of the issues that are before the Committee today. The views expressed here are entirely my own, of course, and not those of any of the organizations I have been associated with. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Green appears in the Appendix on page 311. There is remarkable biodiversity in arrangements for financial regulation at a global level. There are essentially four main types of structure to be found, with multiple variants. There is the sectoral type, with separate regimes for banking, securities, and insurance, which can be found in France, Italy, or Spain. There is the so-called ``twin peaks'' type to be found in Australia or, in alternative versions, in Canada and the Netherlands; the integrated type, which can be found in Germany, Japan, Scandinavia, and, indeed, in the United Kingdom. Then there is perhaps another fourth type, where the United States might fit, with extraordinary diversity. When I was in the FSA, we thought we probably had over a hundred counterpart regulatory bodies in the United States. Then there is the role of the central bank, which may or may not have responsibility for some, many, or, indeed, all aspects of supervision, as it does in Singapore, for instance. Probably the most advanced form of the integrated regulator can be found in the FSA, where it was created remarkably rapidly when the incoming Labour Government simply decided in 1997, without real debate, that at the same time as giving the Bank of England independence in the implementation of monetary policy, it would also create a single regulator for financial services. That was set in train and eventually subsumed 11 prior agencies, and a single new piece of legislation was drafted completely de novo with new objectives for regulation and with a set of principles drafted to guide the regulators. Not all of integrated regulators have that single piece of legislation, and they carry on with sectoral legislation. That is obviously an issue to be thought about when the Committee addresses the legislative structure that is put in place. The bodies were merged in a way which enabled prior existing bodies simply not to be visible anymore. There was full integration. You cannot find within the regulator the bodies that were there before, and that was quite deliberate so that no impression should be created of one of the prior entities somehow taking over the others. The rationale for integrated regulation was set out by the FSA, and in my written testimony, I set out the main arguments, but the core ones, as you know, are that financial conglomerates, in particular, undertake a range of banking, insurance, and investment business. The markets themselves have instruments which mingle features of all those. And it was difficult to carry on regulating on a purely functional basis when that no longer matched the structures of either firms or markets. Integration makes it possible to align the regulatory structure with the way the firms manage themselves so that this should help with the proper understanding of the overall business model and of overall risks. It also means that a regulated firm only needs to deal with one agency for all its regulatory business, ideally through relationship managers on both sides. An integrated regulator ought to be able to manage the conflicts which inevitably arise between the different objectives of regulation, and we will no doubt discuss that later. The concept underlying a single regulator is that these conflicts exist but need to be managed in one place or another, and there have been in the United Kingdom adverse experiences in the management of those conflicts in the past, which is one of the reasons why the intention was to put them together. As regards the role of the central bank, there are a number of issues about the possible conflict of interest which might take place with the independent conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy might be tempted to look more after the regulated community than the wider interest. And those arguments are a little bit more difficult to be certain about. How has the model stood up? Previously, the model was very widely praised. Since the crisis, like of regulators in many places, there has been very wide criticism. But much of the criticism can be pinned down to failures, if you like, at the global level with the international capital rules regarded as having fallen short. Markets were inadequately understood. The way securitization would work and how markets would behave was very widely misunderstood. That has been a common problem. The FSA also made mistakes in not doing what it was supposed to do, simple internal management mistakes. There has been a lot of work done to go over the lessons of the crisis. Both the FSA and the Bank of England have undertaken work to see whether the structure of regulation has identified any patterns of superior models as a result of the crisis, and no patterns have been found. The Bank of England did do some work--which I think I can make available to the Committee--which finds no pattern at all as between integrated, prudential, twin peaks regulator, and sectoral regulator. I think the conclusion has been that the model itself is not really seen to have been implicated in the way the crisis unfolded, and, indeed, the fact that banking, securities, and insurance were all interlinked in the crisis in some people's minds has reinforced the underlying concept. Obviously, I would be very happy to answer further questions as the hearing proceeds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you. That was most interesting and a good beginning. So at this state, we would say that, in your opinion, which one of these regulatory systems was chosen did not have much of an effect on the economic crisis that occurred."
"Mr. Green","That appears to be the case. You can find a number of examples, if you take them in isolation, which reinforce a particular argument. But if you look across the board, you do not find a pattern. The Bank of England work that I referred to, which I am sorry I do not have available here, looked at, I think, about 40 or 50 different jurisdictions and could find no pattern related to structure."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes."
"Mr. Green","And the FSA work has shown that there have been problems when supervision was inside the central bank and when it was outside, and, again, no clear pattern can be found."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is interesting. I normally would hold the questions until after everyone testifies and then I come back. That does not mean that there are not preferences for one over the other form of regulation. I also wanted to thank you for your graciousness in describing the American system as ``diversified.'' That was nicely done. Second we have Dr. Jeffrey Carmichael, the inaugural chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, with responsibility for regulating and supervising banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. Dr. Carmichael currently works in Singapore as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Promontory Financial Group Australasia. Thank you for being here."
"TESTIMONY OF JEFFREY CARMICHAEL, PH.D.,\1\ CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP AUSTRALASIA",""
"Mr. Carmichael","Thank you, Chairman, and let me say what a pleasure it is to be here. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Carmichael appears in the Appendix on page 318. Our government implemented a new structure in the middle of 1998. Unlike the experience that Mr. Green just referred to where the United Kingdom Government did it very quickly, ours was the outcome of a committee that sat for almost 12 months looking at the options, and it was a great privilege for me to have been a member of that committee. The new structure that was put in place realigned a previous structure a little bit like your own. It was an institutionally based structure. It was a hybrid structure of bits and pieces. We had State regulation as well as Federal regulation. What came out of the reorganization is what has become known as an ``objectives-based'' or a twin peaks type model. We do not like the term twin peaks because we actually have four peaks, so we think that is undercounting. But the four agencies that were put in place were: First, a competition regulator that sat over the entire system, not only the financial sector but the whole economy; Second, a securities and investments commission, think of a combination of your SEC and the futures regulator. They had responsibility across all financial sectors for conduct, including financial institutions, markets, and participants; The third was the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the one with which I was involved. We had responsibility for the prudential soundness of all deposit taking, insurance, and pensions; And the fourth was the central bank, which was given, of course, systemic responsibility for monetary policy, liquidity support, and regulation of the payment system. Over the top of that was a coordinating body, called the Council of Financial Regulators, which includes the Department of Treasury as well, and that is a very important add-on. The defining characteristic of this architecture--and I should add this is in some ways very similar to your plan that was proposed by Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson earlier in 2008, but with a couple of important differences, which we can talk about later--is that it was unique in the world at the time it was put in place in Australia, and so far as we know, only one country--and that is the Netherlands--would claim to have the same structure in totality. The Canadian structure is similar, but a little bit less consistent. The Australian banks under this structure, for example, are subject to all four regulators. They have competition covered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), their conduct by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), their prudence by APRA, and if there is a liquidity support or payment system issue, they go to the Reserve Bank. So that is the defining characteristic of this model, that multiple agencies are responsible for each institution, but for a different part of their behavior or their activities. And there is a fairly clear dividing line between those activities. Some of the advantages that we see in this structure--and some of these, of course, are shared by other models such as the British one--include: First, by assigning each regulatory agency to a single objective--that is either competition or prudence--it avoids the conflict of objectives that you face under virtually any other system. So each regulator has just one thing to worry about, and that avoids getting into some of the issues, for example, that Northern Rock brought out, for the FSA. Second, in bringing all regulators of a particular objective together, you get synergies. We learned a lot when we brought banking and insurance regulation together, and we were able to develop an approach that took on the best of both of those systems and to develop synergies out of that. Likewise, ASIC, our conduct regulator, was one of the first in the world to introduce a single licensing regime for market participants. Third, this structure helped eliminate regulatory arbitrage or jurisdiction shopping of the type that you have seen here. Prior to the creation of APRA there were at least three different types of institutions that could issue deposits in Australia, and they were subject to nine different regulatory agencies, depending on where they were located. Following its creation, APRA introduced a fully harmonized regime. We now have a single class of ``deposit-taking institutions.'' We do not distinguish between banks, credit unions, or thrifts. They can take on that separate identity, but they are all regulated as deposit takers. Fourth, by bringing together all of the prudentially regulated institutions under the one regulatory roof, we have a more consistent and effective approach to regulating financial conglomerates, and along with countries like the United Kingdom and Canada, Australia has been at the forefront of developing the approach to conglomerate supervision. Fifth, allocating a single objective to each regulator minimizes the overlap between agencies and the inevitable turf wars that are associated with that, which I am sure you are very familiar with. Interesting for us in our experience was that the gray areas between the agencies have tended to diminish over time rather than to increase, and I think that has been a little bit of a surprise, but a very welcome surprise to those of us who were involved with the design. Sixth, the allocation of a single objective to each agency minimizes cultural clashes, and one of the issues that we were very conscious of in creating the distinction between prudential and conduct regulation was that, while conduct regulation tends to be carried out by lawyers, prudential regulation tends to be carried out in general by accountants and finance and economics experts--with the exception of the United States, where lawyers tend to do it all. So, culturally, we found it was very useful to separate these two types of regulators so that we did not have those cultural battles. Finally, by streamlining our old state-based, or partly state-based, regulatory system, we got a lot of cost efficiencies out of it, and we were able to facilitate strong financial sector development and innovation without having to reduce safety and soundness in the process. In terms of outcomes, our architecture has weathered the recent financial storm better than most. Indeed, I believe our four major banks are still among the few AA-rated banks left in the world. The resilience of our system was helped by exceptionally tough prudential standards, particularly in the areas of capital and securitization. There was also inevitably some good luck as well as good management. I am not going to claim it was all brilliance. In terms of crisis management, the coordination arrangements worked exceptionally well and, I am told, in speaking with each of the agencies recently, that they found the singularity of objectives helped them enormously in terms of coordination among the different agencies in the crisis. On the less positive side, like everyone else, we have learned that regulators and industry know much less about risk than we thought we did. We have had to think about the way risk is measured and regulated. Most importantly, we have learned that financial stability regulation is a much bigger challenge than we thought it was, and there is a lot still to be learned there. And to borrow the Churchillian phrase, we regulators have learned that ``we have much about which to be modest.'' In concluding, Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer two very general observations. The first echoes a point you made in your opening statement. There can be little dispute that regulatory architecture matters. It is very important. There is no perfect architecture. There is no one size fits all. But there are certainly some architectures that are virtually guaranteed to fail under sufficient pressure. That said, architecture is only half the story. A sound architecture is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for effective regulation. The other component, which you mentioned, is how you implement and enforce those regulations, and it is very important that these two components are considered in tandem and not in isolation. Finally, it is easier to tinker with the architecture than to do major reform. Major reform is largely about opportunity. The window for reform is usually only open very briefly. You have, arguably, the widest window for reform since the Great Depression. This crisis provides you with the public support and, I believe, the industry acquiescence to challenge the vested interests and inertia that normally make major reform of the type you have seen in some other countries all but impossible. And I am sure I speak for many of my colleagues in the international regulatory community, in hoping that this opportunity is not lost. Thank you."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you very much. Well said. I have many concerns, but one clearly is that the result of this crisis will be that we will change some regulations, some law, but we will not change the regulatory structure very much because of the resistance of those in the financial communities but also, frankly, here in Congress to changing the status quo. So your words are very much on target. I thank you. Our third witness is Dr. Edmund Clark, President and CEO of the TD Bank Financial Group in Canada. Mr. Clark has had a long and distinguished career in both the Canadian Government and private industry, and we are very grateful that you are here today. Please proceed."
"TESTIMONY OF W. EDMUND CLARK, PH.D.,\1\ PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TD BANK FINANCIAL GROUP",""
"Mr. Clark","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Collins, for inviting me, and thank you to the other Members. I am obviously not here as a regulatory expert, but we have a wonderful panel. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Clark appears in the Appendix on page 326. I am going to speak much more as a CEO who operates under the regulatory regimes. We are a little unusual in the sense that we operate on both sides of the border in Canada and the United States. We have over 1,000 branches in the United States from Maine to Florida, and we are a bank in the United States that is continuing to lend, and lend aggressively. So we have double-digit lending growth, and we are one of the few AAA- rated banks left in the world. We exited the structured products area in 2005, the source of most of the problems. I thought I would comment on a couple of things, and one was the actual management of the crisis from the beginning of August 2007 until now, and I think what certainly distinguished the Canadian system, which may not be duplicable in larger countries, is that the six banks plus the Bank of Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), and the Department of Finance essentially worked almost continuously together and have a shared objective. There was a very strong feeling among us that if any one of our banks ran into trouble, we would all run into trouble. So there was no attempt by one bank to, in a sense, game the system, and there was also fairly quickly a view that we should try to have a private sector solution to this problem, not a public sector solution; and to the extent we involved the public sector, it should be a profitable involvement on behalf of the taxpayers, not a subsidy, and we were able to successfully do that. In terms of the structure of the industry, I think it is well known that there are some important differences. All the major dealers are owned by the Canadian banks, and we did, in fact, absorb $18 billion (CAD) of write-offs by these dealers. TD Bank did not have any significant write-offs, but $18 billion (CAD) is a significant amount in the size of Canada, but they were able to absorb that because they were tied to large entities with very stable retail earnings. Second, the mortgage market is completely different in Canada. It is concentrated in the top banks, and we originate mortgages to hold them. And so we have resisted attempts-- frankly, political attempts--to have us loosen standards because we are going to bear the risks of those loosened standards. So you did not get the development in Canada of what you did in the United States. Third, in terms of the capital requirements, our capital requirements have always been above world standards, with a particular emphasis on common equity. But it has also been reinforced by the insistence of our regulation that we have our own self-assessment of how much capital we need, and that in all cases, it caused Canadian banks to hold more than regulatory minimums, not at regulatory minimums. I think the other difference would be that our regime's binding constraint is risk-weighted assets, and that is a key feature why we hold our mortgages rather than sell them. Where you have total asset tests, you, in fact, encourage banks to sell low-risk assets, and where we have a total asset test is not the binding constraint. In terms of the nature of the regulatory regime, it is a principles regime, not a rule-based regime--it is rather light in terms of the actual number of people employed in the regulatory regime. There is a high focus on ensuring that management and the board know and understand the risks that the institution is taking and that, in fact, they are building the infrastructure to monitor and manage that risk. The way I put it internally in my organization is I am actually on the side of the regulator, not on the side of the bank. We have the same interest in ensuring that the bank does not run into trouble, and do you have less of this conflict situation because I see the regulator as helping me manage the bank. I think another important element that Canada moved to in terms of compensation some time ago was to have low cash bonuses. So in my case, 70 percent of my pay would be in the form of equity which I hold. I am required to hold my economic interests in the bank for 2 years after I retire, so I cannot cut and run. And all my executives, whether in the wholesale side of the bank or the retail side of the bank, are paid on the whole bank's performance, including its ability to deliver great customer satisfaction. We also have separation of the chairman from the CEO, and all board and committee meetings have meetings without management present to ensure that independence. Clearly, the issue, I think, you are addressing is the issue of systemic risk, and I think it is the toughest issue to deal with here. I think I would have to be in the camp to say all the systemic risk issues were well known and well talked about. It is not as if there was this mystery out there that the U.S. mortgage system was, in fact, going way up the risk curve and doing what most bankers would have regarded as crazy lending. It is not as if there was not meeting after meeting among bankers around the world about the risks that are inherent in structured products. And I would say the under- saving feature of the U.S. economy was a well-known fact. And so I think you do have to sit back and say, well, if these risks were well known, why were there no, in a sense, forces against that? I can comment on our own experience. As I indicated, we did actually exit these products. We exited them because they were hard to understand. They embedded tail risk and added a lot of complexity to the organization. We also refused to, in fact, distribute the asset-backed paper program that blew up in Canada on the basis that if I would not sell it to my mother- in-law, I should not sell it to my clients. But the real issue is that in doing that, that was a very unpopular thing to do. It was unpopular within my bank. It was unpopular among my investors. It is very hard to run against these tides, and so I think when you are talking about systemic risk, you have to recognize that there is this odd confluence of political, economic, and profit force actually always propelling it. It is like a lot of the literature, what creates boom. You have the same thing behind any forces of systemic risk. So what is my conclusion as a practicer in the field? Well, I do not think there is one answer because, as I have said, banks have failed under most regulatory regimes. But I do think a strong regulator is important, and you certainly should not allow regulatory shopping. I think that is obviously a very bad thing. And while rules are important, I actually think principles do matter. It was clear throughout the industry that people were in the process of using regulatory capital arbitrage, and if you sat there from a principle point of view, I think you might have stopped it. Leadership matters enormously. I think boards should be held accountable to ensure that they actually have a CEO with the right value system. His job is to preserve the institution. And I think it is clear to say while all regulatory regimes may have known about systemic risk, they did not focus on systemic risk. And I think we are lacking mechanisms where, if you did come upon a view that existed, how would you, in fact, coordinate action to bring it to an end? I do think going forward, though, there is also a risk that we could overreact, and one of the things I would plead is that many elements of the regulatory reforms could drive institutions to take more risk rather than less risk. And I think you have to be careful in your rules to make sure that low-risk strategies, such as the TD Bank one, are not, in fact, negatively impacted by some of the rule changes. Thank you very much."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you very much. Refreshing. I must say, I did not know how different the regulatory system and some of the rules of behavior were, and it is striking that one of the reasons that Canada did not get into some of the same mortgage problems as we did was really because of regulation, some of the things you were prohibited from doing."
"Mr. Clark","Right. There was an element of regulation that prohibited us, but also we had a capital regime that said we could hold low-risk assets and not have large amounts of capital. And that is a critical feature to the originate-and- hold model."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you. Our final witness this morning is from closer to home. David Nason was at the Treasury Department during March 2008 and before and was very active in the construction of the Treasury Department's March 2008 ``Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure,'' previously known as ``the Paulson plan.'' Mr. Nason is now the Managing Director for Promontory Financial Group here in Washington, DC. We have two of the four witnesses from the Promontory Group. That speaks well for the group. Mr. Nason, we welcome your testimony."
"TESTIMONY OF DAVID G. NASON,\1\ MANAGING DIRECTOR, PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP, LLC",""
"Mr. Nason","Thank you for having me. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to appear before you today on these important matters. As the United States begins to evaluate its financial regulatory framework, it is vital that it incorporate the lessons and experience from other countries' reform efforts. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Nason appears in the Appendix on page 334. I recently, as you just mentioned, finished a 3-year stint at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where I was honored to serve former Secretaries Jon Snow and Henry Paulson. And as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, I worked hand in hand with the government as they tried to respond to the financial crisis. More germane to this particular hearing is I am particularly proud to have led the team that researched and wrote the Treasury's ``Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure,'' which was published in March 2008. And many of the issues that we evaluated in the writing of the Blueprint are before the Congress and the focus of this hearing. What seems clear as we think about this issue is that financial institutions play an essential role in a large part of our U.S. economy, and given the economic significance of the sector, it is important that we examine the structure of our regulatory framework as we think about the content of regulations. And this is all the more pressing as the United States begins to emerge from the current financial crisis. The root causes of the financial crisis are well documented. Benign economic conditions and plentiful market liquidity led to risk complacency, dramatic weakening of underwriting standards for U.S. mortgages, especially subprime mortgages, and a general loosening of credit terms of loans to households and businesses. The confluence of many events led to a significant credit contraction and a dramatic repricing of risk. We are still living through this process right now, and we have seen more government intervention in the financial markets than we have seen in decades. The focus of this hearing today is prospective, however, and the financial crisis has told us that regulatory structure is not merely an academic issue and that topics like regulatory arbitrage matter and have meaningful repercussions outside of the province of academia. Indeed, if we look for something positive in the aftermath of the crisis, it might be that it will give us the courage to make the hard choices and reform our financial regulatory architecture. We have learned all too well that our regulators and regulations were not well positioned to adapt to the rapid financial innovation driven by capital mobility, deep liquidity, and technology. Regulation alone and modernized architecture could not have prevented all of the problems from these developments. But we can do much better, and we can position ourselves better. Our current regulatory structure in the United States no longer reflects the complexity of our markets. This complexity and the severity of the financial crisis pressured the U.S. regulatory structure, exposing regulatory gaps as well as redundancies. Our system, much of it created over 70 years ago, is grappling to keep pace with market evolutions and facing increasing difficulties, at times, in preventing and anticipating financial crises. Largely incompatible with these market developments is our current system of functional regulation, which maintains separate regulatory agencies across segregated functional lines of financial services, such as banking, insurance, securities, and futures, with no single regulator possessing all of the information and authority necessary to monitor systemic risk. Moreover, our current system results in duplication of certain common activities across regulators. Now, while some degree of specialization might be important for the regulation of financial institutions, many aspects of financial regulation and consumer protection regulation have common themes. So as we consider the future construct of our U.S. financial regulation, we should first look to the experience of other countries, especially those that have conducted a thoughtful review recently, like we have heard today. As global financial markets integrate and accounting standards converge, it is only natural for regulatory practices to follow suit. There are two dominant forms of financial regulatory regimes that should be considered seriously in the United States as we rethink our regulatory model. I would like to focus on the consolidated regulator approach and the twin peaks approach. Under a single consolidated regulator approach, one regulator responsible for both financial and consumer protection regulation would regulate all financial institutions. The United Kingdom's consolidation of regulation within the FSA exemplifies this approach, although other countries such as Japan have moved in this direction. The general consolidated regulator approach eliminates the role of the central bank from financial institution regulation, but preserves its role in determining monetary policy and performing some functions related to overall financial market stability. A key advantage of the consolidated regulator approach that we should consider is enhanced efficiency from combining common functions undertaken by individual regulators into one entity. A consolidated regulator approach should allow for a better understanding of overall risks to the financial system. While the consolidated regulator approach benefits are clear, there are also potential problems that we should consider. For example, housing all regulatory functions related to financial and consumer regulation in one entity may lead to varying degrees of focus on these key functions. Also, the scale of operations necessary to establish a single consolidated regulator in the United States could make the model more difficult to implement in comparison to other jurisdictions. Another major approach, adopted mostly notably by our colleagues at the table in Australia and in the Netherlands, indeed, is the twin peaks model that emphasizes regulation by objectives. One regulatory body is responsible for prudential regulation of relevant financial institutions, and a separate and distinct agency is responsible for business conduct and consumer protection. The primary advantage of this model is that it maximizes regulatory focus by concentrating responsibility for correcting a single form of market failure-- one agency, one objective. This consolidation reduces regulatory gaps, turf wars among regulators, and the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage by financial institutions, while unlocking natural synergies among agencies. And perhaps more importantly, it reflects the financial markets' extraordinary integration and complexity. It does pose a key problem in that effective lines of communication between the peaks are vital to success. There are several ideas in circulation in the United States. I would like to focus on some things that we focused on in the Treasury Blueprint in 2008 and some other relevant policymakers that are talking about other ideas. The March 2008 Blueprint proposes that the United States consider an objectives-based regulatory framework, similar to what Dr. Carmichael discussed, with three objectives: Market stability regulation, prudential regulation to address issues of limited market discipline, and business conduct regulation. Prudential regulation housed within one regulatory body in the United States can focus on the common elements of risk management across financial institutions, which is sorely lacking in the United States. Regulators focused on specific objectives can be more effective at enforcing market discipline by targeting of financial institutions for which prudential regulation is most appropriate. Secretary of the Treasury Geithner and FDIC Chair Bair addressed similar issues of importance in dealing with too-big- to-fail institutions and the necessity of providing systemic risk regulation. Senator Collins, you introduced legislation that recognizes the key aspects that need to be addressed in our system to deal with these difficult problems. So while there is an emerging consensus in the United States and among global financial regulators, market participants, and policymakers that systemic risk regulation and resolution authority must be a cornerstone of reform financial regulation, the exact details of the proposals need to be settled. These are very complicated and they require thoughtful debate and deliberation. One point, however, is clear: The U.S. regulatory system, in its current form, needs to be modernized and evolved. We should seize upon this opportunity to do this. To this end, the future American regulatory framework must be directed towards its proper objectives to maintain a stable, well-capitalized, and responsible financial sector. Thank you for inviting me."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks, Mr. Nason. Very helpful. A vote just went off, but I think we are going to try to do a kind of tag team here, so Senator Collins will go over now, and I will ask questions, and then we will go on from there. The testimony has been very interesting. While your testimony is in my mind, Mr. Nason, just take a moment, and if we went to the twin peaks here--although as Dr. Carmichael said, there are actually four in Australia--what would be under the two peaks?"
"Mr. Nason","Well, I said the twin peaks model, but essentially we would be asking for three peaks."
"Chairman Lieberman","Three, really."
"Mr. Nason","Three peaks in the United States."
"Chairman Lieberman","One being the Federal Reserve."
"Mr. Nason","One would be market stability regulation, which we recommend in the Blueprint would be housed at the Federal Reserve."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Nason","One would be prudential regulation of institutions that require prudential regulation for your banks and your insurance companies. And then business conduct regulation, which is the type of consumer protection regulation that we historically see in the consumer aspects of the Federal Reserve and the banking agencies and most of what the Securities and Exchange Commission does."
"Chairman Lieberman","So you would split up some of the existing regulatory agencies' functions, so it is not as simple as asking which agencies would go under which, because you would take pieces of each."
"Mr. Nason","Yes, the model in the United States, it is a difficult way to think about it, but if you take the consumer elements of the banking agencies, put them under the business conduct regulator, take the bulk of the responsibilities of the SEC, put them under the business conduct regulator, and leave the prudential or financial regulation in a separate regulatory body, those are the two peaks. And then I think there is an important role that is not demonstrated in those two peaks: Someone taking the ownership of systemwide risks, and that is the important role that we give to the Federal Reserve in our Blueprint."
"Chairman Lieberman","Incidentally, I like the Paulson plan's use of the words ``market stability regulator'' because I think it is more clear than systemic regulator, which always confuses me at least."
"Mr. Nason","We spent an enormous amount of time debating that, and I am glad you noticed it. The one reason we called it ``market stability'' is to indicate to everyone that you are going to have bouts of instability, and the goal is to try to keep the markets as stable as possible. But you cannot prevent it."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right. Let me ask Mr. Green, Dr. Carmichael, and Dr. Clark, from outside the United States looking in--acknowledging that we have heard some mixed testimony here on the question I am about to ask--and based on your experience, obviously, what role do you think the fragmented nature of our current structure played in the extent of the current economic crisis here in the United States? Can you make a judgment on that, Mr. Green?"
"Mr. Green","I think the most striking example--and there are several--was the AIG affair, where, of course, there was no Federal jurisdiction, as you know, which meant that although there was a lead regulator in the New York State Insurance Commission, nevertheless, that jurisdiction was shared with a lot of other regulators. And the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) also had a role, and I think it is fairly clear and widely acknowledged that this meant there were gaps in terms of looking at the whole picture for a global firm."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Green","The other example I think relates to the U.S. investment banks, which almost uniquely at the global level were not regulated along with the rest of the banking system. And that led to gaps or inconsistencies. They were not-- although they did business that was very similar----"
"Chairman Lieberman","To banks. Mr. Green . To banks and, indeed, in the rest of the world was done in banks. Nevertheless, they had a quite different capital regime, and, indeed, curiously, their consolidated capital regime was voluntary. That, of course, came to an end very abruptly over a weekend. This was a risk that a lot of people knew was waiting to be crystallized. But those are two big examples, if you like."
"Chairman Lieberman","So those are examples that suggest that structure had some kind of causal effect, or at least enabling effect on the crisis. Dr. Carmichael, what would you say? And they are good examples, I think."
"Mr. Carmichael","I do not have a lot to add to that because I think it is spot on. If one had to put rough percentages on it--and this has got no science--I would say it was enabled 70 percent by the structure and 30 percent by bad regulation. So I think the structure actually had more to do with the problem. I will add one example to what Mr. Green said. I was interested in one regulatory response to AIG--regulated, of course, by the State regulator. The State regulator said, ``We now want to regulate credit default swaps as an insurance product,'' and immediately the impossibility of that became apparent in that, unless the other 49 States agreed to do it, the business would just move over the border. And this is not a national border. It is just moving across the Hudson River, for example. So the insurance regulatory structure enables arbitrage, enables gravitation to the lowest common denominator. Like Mr. Green, we were amazed when we found that AIG was regulated by OTS as a conglomerate. That just seems ludicrous. So I agree entirely."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks. Dr. Clark."
"Mr. Clark","I guess what I would say I would not get yourself trapped that if you cannot take a direct link back to the great financial crisis, you should not clean it up. And so I would say the U.S. system obviously has a lot of issues that, even if they did not create the great financial crisis, certainly do not make the system run any better. And so I think whether you have 100 regulators or 50 does not matter. There is clearly regulatory shopping that goes on constantly in the United States, and that cannot be a good thing to have a sound system."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is a very important point. We are focused on this now because of the current crisis, and there are some clear linkages, as Mr. Green and Dr. Carmichael said. But there are obviously other reasons beyond that to want to alter our structure, and that is one of them--regulatory shopping. What else? You made a reference in your gracious and diplomatic use of the term ``diversified.'' I presume that underneath that was some sense that it was really pretty hard to work together with the United States because of the way in which the regulatory system was so dispersed?"
"Mr. Green","Certainly for regulators in the rest of the world--and Mr. Carmichael will have a view on this as well. Leave aside this AIG problem, even in the banking field there was no single voice in the United States. Although a case can be made for regulatory competition in this kind of area, it is not very clear where the advantages came from regulatory competition, and certainly in international discussions, it is very difficult to have a completely coherent discussion when there are three or four counterparties in some discussions even about capital. And the SEC, if it was not there, should have been there."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Green","It makes it very difficult to come to international consensus."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes, and obviously we are in--to say the obvious--a global economy, and there are times when we want to have interactions globally that are not facilitated by the way in which we are organized. So I take your point. I am going to have to go in a minute, but, Mr. Nason, from the U.S. perspective, are there any negative effects for American business in a global economy that result--or even domestically, but particularly globally--from this fractured system we have now?"
"Mr. Nason","Sure. The clearest and easiest example--sorry to beat it to death--is insurance. There are two things that are clear. One, the international community does not understand and appreciate the State regulatory system for insurance, so that American industry is not well represented around the globe. And, second, in periods of crisis like this, we learned all too well at the Treasury that we would be benefited significantly by having a Federal expert in insurance that you can draw upon for expertise. One of the big problems associated with dealing with the AIG failure is there is no Federal person responsible for that industry, so you cannot draw on Federal expertise. And that was a very significant consequence of having this fractured system. Another example we mentioned is the Office of Thrift Supervision, which has oversight responsibilities for the holding companies of a lot of these institutions, but does not have the appropriate stature to represent the thrifts around the world. So it is an inequality that hurts the institutions that have thrifts in this structure."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you. I am going to ask that we stand in recess. As soon as Senator Collins comes back, I will ask the staff to please encourage her to begin her questioning. The hearing is recessed. Senator Collins . The hearing will come back to order. Senator Lieberman has graciously allowed me to temporarily assume the role of Chairman and reconvene the hearing so that we can keep proceeding through this vote. I want to thank each of you for your very interesting testimony and bring up several issues in the hopes that I am not repeating too much of what the Chairman may have already asked you. Mr. Carmichael, you talked about the four peaks, as you described it, and that some of the advantages were that each focuses on one aspect. You avoid conflict. You have essentially a functional regulatory approach. And then you said there is also a council of regulators. Does that council of regulators have responsibility for identifying systemic risk?"
"Mr. Carmichael","In a short answer, yes. But, more importantly, their role is to communicate and coordinate between the agencies and to make sure that there is a regular testing of issues. Sometimes the central bank, if it is concerned about a systemic issue, has the power to send some of its staff with the prudential people going on inspections, for example, to learn more about what some of those issues might be. The involvement of the Treasury is there for exactly the systemic type reason. So while it does not have any direct authority--there is no charter that gives it the power to do anything--through coordination they are able to focus the issues and decide, for example, do we need more information about a particular area? Do we need one of the agencies to collect that on behalf of the systemic regulator?"
"Senator Collins","Mr. Nason, I know you were very involved in the Paulson Blueprint for reform, and I very much appreciated your insights. As I understand it, the Blueprint that Secretary Paulson put out did call for a systemic risk regulator, but it would be vested in, I believe, the Federal Reserve. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Nason","Yes."
"Senator Collins","When you were involved in drafting the Blueprint, was consideration given to the council approach?"
"Mr. Nason","It was not labeled the ``council approach,'' but one thing we did consider was providing more authority to the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which is very similar to the council approach. We thought about it very seriously because there is a lot of elements of attractiveness to having a council because you are bringing a lot of different sets of expertise to bear. One of the things we got tripped up on is providing the right amount of authority, and we were worried about clarity of purpose and clarity of mission among a council. But it is certainly something that we considered seriously."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Clark, is there a system for identifying systemic risk in Canada?"
"Mr. Clark","The system, I think, would be very similar, as I understand from Dr. Carmichael, to the Australian system. There is a group that meets regularly that is chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance and would have our regulator, OSFI, on it and would have the Bank of Canada on it and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), the equivalent to the FDIC, on it. And, in fact, they have now created two committees--one which is called the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC), which is designed more to deal with low-level coordination issues, and then a second one that deals with more explicitly strategic issues. And I think it is probably fair to say that as a result of this crisis, the role of that committee in making sure that they are debating what the systemic risk is and who is doing what about it has been elevated as a result of this."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Green, what about in Great Britain? How is systemic risk handled?"
"Mr. Green","There is a so-called tripartite committee which brings together the Bank of England--the central bank--the FSA, and the Treasury, which was intended to look at the functioning of the system as a whole. And the Bank of England had a mandate in relation to the stability of the system as a whole. I think there was insufficient clarity about just what that meant in the original drafting and what that meant in terms of the role of the Bank of England--which, in fact, leaves a bit of a question in my mind in relation to the so-called Paulson Blueprint. The central bank has, as the monetary authority, the capacity to lend and to change monetary policy. But then there is an issue about what other tools does it have? Does it have the capacity then to instruct the regulators to take action on grounds of systemic risk? I think, in fact, in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England did not think that it had that authority. And the way the system worked, the lack of clarity of objectives in retrospect proved a bit of a disadvantage. And the Bank of England spent its time talking about the economy, and the FSA spent its time thinking about the individual firms. And one of the main lessons that has been learnt from the crisis is that the regulator needs to think more about what is happening in the wider economy, and the central bank needs to remember that monetary policy only has effect through the financial system. So it is quite a subtle set of links that is difficult to get precisely right."
"Senator Collins","I think those are excellent points. Mr. Nason, obviously one of the failures of our system was a failure to identify high-risk products that escaped regulation and yet ended up having a cascade of consequences for the entire financial system. And I am thinking in particular of credit default swaps, which in my mind were an insurance product, but they were not regulated as an insurance product. They were not regulated as a securities product. They really were not regulated by anyone. And as long as we have bright financial people, which we always will, we are going to have innovation and the creation of new derivatives, new products. One of my goals is to try to prevent these what I call ``regulatory black holes'' from occurring where a high-risk practice or product can emerge and no one regulator in our system has clear authority over it. Without a council, there is nobody to identify it and figure out who should be regulating it. What are your thoughts on preventing these regulatory gaps?"
"Mr. Nason","I think there is a lot to like about what you are trying to achieve in your legislative proposal. I think that identifying the fact that credit default swap (CDS) and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts are a source or a potential source of systemic risk is very important, and I am really happy to see you have identified it here and the Administration is thinking about ideas like putting them on exchanges and things like that, because OTC derivatives were typically not regulated because they were viewed as bilateral contracts between sophisticated parties. But they grew so big and they are so significant in the U.S. system that they proved to be two things: One, a source of great opaqueness in financial institutions where you could not get a sense of how important the derivative book was to a particular institution; and, two, a real channel for the too-interconnected-to-fail problem. So I think that you are certainly right to identify them as something that needs to be looked at carefully. I think that they are certainly something that should be under the supervision, oversight, and jurisdiction of a council or a systemic risk regulator. And I think that I am happy that things are moving along in that way."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Clark, I admire your foresight in deciding that some of these derivative products were simply not well understood and were too high risk in getting out of that market. In Canada, however, was there regulation of credit default swaps and those kinds of exotic derivatives? Or did the regulation only come about through safety and soundness regulations? If you understand what I am saying."
"Mr. Clark","I think so. In a sense, it was safety and soundness, and I think it is fair to say as we were exiting the business, Canadian banks were going into the business. So it was not as if our regulator was saying do not do this."
"Senator Collins","That is what I was wondering."
"Mr. Clark","And as I pointed out earlier, Canadian banks collectively took $18 billion (CAD) in writedowns. So in U.S. terms, that is $180 billion, given the size of the country, so it is not an insignificant amount. So we cannot stand here and say there are no problems in Canada. I think that would be a misnomer. I think this is a very difficult area because I think the reality is that people were aware of this and they were aware that the products were getting bigger and more complex. But as we were talking during the break, the reality is that people were making a lot of money on it, and it looked like it was very profitable. And I would say in its initial evolution, credit derivatives were actually a positive factor, and so for us as a bank, we were able to lay off a significant amount of our risk by buying credit protection, and in that sense we saw it as a good thing, not a bad thing. And it is only as a later evolution that in a sense it ended up causing, I think, some of the problems. I think it underscores the capability issue, the one we talked earlier about AIG, that in this war, if you will, or race for knowledge, you have a very profitable and highly sophisticated industry in the banking system around the world. I think it does mean that you cannot afford to have three or four regulators trying to go up the scale of knowledge. You do have to have a concentrated knowledge in order to attract the people to try to have a counter-push to these ideas."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Carmichael, any thoughts on how to prevent regulatory black holes as new products emerge?"
"Mr. Carmichael","Two things I would add to the comments made so far. First of all, having banking and insurance under the one regulator, as is the case in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, gives your regulator a much better chance to pick up where those risks are being laid off. And you look at the United States where you have 50 State insurance regulators, picking that up as a problem for AIG was much more difficult than it would have been under the other architectures. The other side of it that I would add is that in a structure where you have a clear conduct regulator and that regulator has a responsibility for markets, that is where the primary responsibility for new markets, which is where new products tend to spring up. Regardless of how the market is conducted, whether bilateral or on an organized exchange, conduct should be the responsibility of that particular regulator, provided they have the mandate and the skills to pick that up and do with it what they need to. That is where you would get the primary regulation, the disclosures, the aggregation of information, and so on for those markets."
"Senator Collins","Thank you. Senator McCaskill."
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MCCASKILL",""
"Senator McCaskill","Thank you. I do not know if you can help, Mr. Nason, but I have had a hard time figuring out how we missed all this. And you were at the Treasury Department for the 3 years prior to when we came this close to a global meltdown as it relates to our credit markets. And, I guess I am curious as to why you think no one at Treasury--I mean, I was in a room with Secretary Paulson, and I do not want to say that they were panicked, but there is a reason why there was such bipartisan support 40 days before our political election. If there was ever a time in this building that the two sides cannot get along, it would be 40 days before our national presidential elections. And when you had both major candidates for President voting in favor from both ends of the political spectrum, that was because we all had been given very detailed and accurate information about how close we were to completely falling off the table as it related to our credit markets. I cannot get comfortable with how we are going to identify risk going forward if the best and the brightest in our country, supposedly the best financial minds in the world, did not see this coming. Can you help me?"
"Mr. Nason","I can try to help you. I do not have the answers, and we will be debating this for decades as to what actually happened. But I think there were a couple things that happened. People saw individual things that they were worried about. The regulators knew that underwriting criteria had gone down for home mortgages. People had seen there was a very frothy housing market. People had seen that the covenants in debt were going down to a level that they were concerned with. But I think what really was very surprising and what caught people off guard was the severity with which things went from being very frothy--people were not paying adequate attention to risk, so the pendulum was nobody cared about risk at all, people were just worried about making money--to people who were not willing to take risk at all. So there was just a complete and utter contraction of credit in the economy that caused an enormous contraction. The speed with which that happened was something that people were not expecting. You got to a point where money center banks would not lend to each other for 20 days or for 10 days without paying exorbitant interest rates. So you had a complete breakdown in confidence. And I cannot give you comfort that we are going to find it again. I can give you comfort that this is that 1-in-100-year event. And you can try to manage it better, you can try to prepare yourself better, but this is one of those things where I do not think you can predict it. You can just put yourself in a better position to try to deal with it."
"Senator McCaskill","Which of the three parts of your plan would be responsible for identifying what happened?"
"Mr. Nason","Well, the three parts of the plan--first of all, the plan was not created to deal with the financial crisis. It was actually written before the financial crisis happened."
"Senator McCaskill","You wrote it in March, right?"
"Mr. Nason","Well, we researched and wrote it the year going up to March, and we released it right after Bear Stearns failed, but it was not in response to those types of events."
"Senator McCaskill","Right."
"Mr. Nason","So the plan is not a lookback plan. But I think generally speaking, you would have coordination among the three parties to describe how to better position ourselves to deal with this better."
"Senator McCaskill","Let us assume that instead of your plan being announced in March 2008--obviously, this is a fantasy-- that Congress passed it whole cloth and it was in existence. Which is the body that you would expect under the plan that has been drawn up would be the one to say things are nuts, people are overleveraging, they have no idea what they are buying and selling, they are chasing a number, and it is all about greed?"
"Mr. Nason","Sure. I would tell you that each of the three would have a role, and here is what they would do. On the prudential side, there would be tightened standards for capital for financial institutions and more regulation on liquidity management. On the conduct side, there would be stronger regulations for mortgages and things like that. And on the market stability side, there would be more focus on the interconnectedness of these two institutions and also of things like the derivatives markets. Those would be three ways that each of the three pillars of the Paulson plan would respond to this."
"Senator McCaskill","Is it possible that the three pillars of the Paulson plan, that each one of those pillars would have said it was their job?"
"Mr. Nason","No. That is actually one of the premises of the Paulson plan, is clarity of mission and clarity of objective. See, one of the problems that we dealt with was that there was a lot of finger pointing. There were battles between the State regulators versus the Federal regulators on who was in charge of mortgage origination. So there were concerns about who was in charge of the holding company of Lehman Brothers. Was it the OTS or the SEC? So there is much less chance for finger pointing under an objectives-based criteria like the Dutch and the Australians have."
"Senator McCaskill","Mr. Clark, I heard you say that you originate mortgages to hold them, and I keep explaining that one of my concerns about reverse mortgages that we are now ramping up in this country is that they are very similar to subprimes in that the people who are closing loans have no skin in the game. Now, the scary thing about reverse mortgages is that all of the skin is taxpayer skin. If those assets are sold at term and they are not sufficient to cover the loan, the Federal Government has to cover the loan. But in the subprime, it was all of these exotic sliced and diced derivatives that were spread out all over that we are trying, like Humpty- Dumpty, to put back together again now. I assume that in Canada the people who are holding the mortgage are the same ones who made them and, therefore, they continue to have skin in the game."
"Mr. Clark","Absolutely. We originate all the mortgages. We do not buy mortgages. We originate our own mortgages. And, therefore, we are very concerned about the underwriting standards because we are going to take the risks. I do believe that the system of holding the mortgages does a couple of things for you. One, it means you have the banking system trying to make sure you have conservative risk, not wild risk. But, second, it actually gives us an asset. The way I always describe our bank is we are not an income statement that generates a balance sheet. We are a balance sheet that generates an income statement. And that means we have a solidity of earnings that is there because we are not originating mortgages, then selling them off, and then saying, well, where am I getting next year's income if we originate more and sell them off. We are actually holding them. And so I think it produces tremendous stability in the system, but it does require a regulatory regime that does not penalize you for capital if, in fact, you hold a low-risk asset like that."
"Senator McCaskill","Do you think we should have regulations that require people who close mortgages to assume some of the risk?"
"Mr. Clark","I think some system where the people who originate have skin in the game is quite important."
"Senator McCaskill","Mr. Nason, what do you think?"
"Mr. Nason","I think that what we have seen is that our securitization markets certainly got overheated, and there is certainly some merit----"
"Senator McCaskill","I think a bonfire is more like it."
"Mr. Nason","I am not going to quibble with that. I think a bonfire is just fine. I do want to suggest, though, that the securitization market, it is a bad word right now and it is an ugly word, but it has a lot of value. It provides a lot of credit to the economy. A lot of markets depend on it. It is important to rebuild that market so we can get more credit in the economy. Today, the auto industry relies on it; a lot of industries rely on it. So it is important. Whether or not it overheated like a bonfire, I think that is a fair characterization."
"Senator McCaskill","Would you mind if I ask one more question? Chairman Lieberman . Go right ahead, Senator."
"Senator McCaskill","I am a little uneasy about BlackRock. I know that BlackRock was called in to manage at the New York Federal Reserve in terms of some of the valuation of the assets, and I know that there is some valuation of assets and then there is going around to the other window and participating--and I keep hearing that BlackRock is the only game in town, and that is why they are getting all these contracts. Their name came up again yesterday in connection with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the guaranty fund for pensions in this country. I keep hearing that BlackRock is the only company that has the model and it is proprietary, and therefore, they are the only game in town, and we keep going back to BlackRock. In fact, I had somebody tell me that the Secretary of the Treasury talked more often to the head of BlackRock than probably a lot of other folks. And I do not know if that is true or not, but it worries me because of the--too big to fail aspect. Can I get you, without threat of torture, to give me your take on why BlackRock is all of a sudden everywhere and is involved in everything as it relates to sorting out our financial mess?"
"Mr. Nason","A couple of things. I cannot imagine that the comment that either Secretary of the Treasury spent more time talking to BlackRock than anyone else is accurate."
"Senator McCaskill","Hyperbole."
"Mr. Nason","Hyperbole. That is one thing. The second thing is the determination of hiring BlackRock to manage the assets in the Maiden Lane/Bear Stearns situation, I think that was a decision made by the Federal Reserve, so that is not something I can speak about. I think generally speaking what you are dealing with is a large risk transfer of assets from financial institutions to a variety of structures. And what the government is trying to do is to protect the U.S. taxpayers' interest, hire someone who has some experience in managing those particular assets. BlackRock, Western Asset Management Company (WAMCO), and the Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO)--there are a couple of people who are very experienced in that. I do not know the specifics of that particular situation, but the only thing I can say is that there is a lot of oversight and regulation for this process. There are the procurement rules. There is the GAO and the TARP Inspector General that are making sure that policies and procedures are followed. So I think you can take comfort in the process surrounding how these asset managers are retained and the solicitations being made for them. That should give you comfort. I think there is a lot of transparency in that as well."
"Senator McCaskill","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thank you, Senator McCaskill. Thanks for participating this afternoon. We will do a second round insofar as Members want to be here or can be here. The Paulson plan, the Treasury Department's plan, issued last March, as you probably know, envisioned a regulatory system similar to Australia's, which was objectives based. The report was controversial here, although, unfortunately, it got overwhelmed by the growing crisis, so it did not receive the discussion I think it deserved. But it called for consolidation and dissolution of some existing agencies. One controversial reform, which we have referred to briefly here this morning, was the consolidation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). I wanted to ask our three witnesses from outside the United States--I think I know the answer, but not totally--if any of the three countries divide the regulation of securities and futures the way we do here in the United States, or are they regulated under one roof? Mr. Green, everything is under one roof?"
"Mr. Green","Everyone is under one roof and, indeed, it was, I think, always under one roof before the great merger into the FSA."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Green","There was no real distinction between the primary markets and the derivative markets. And I must say--and I stand to be corrected by my colleagues here--I am not aware of any other country where there is such a distinction."
"Chairman Lieberman","Interesting. Correct, as far as you know, Mr. Carmichael?"
"Mr. Carmichael","Yes, certainly in Australia, it has always been under the one roof. What changed after we restructured was that we also had brought it into one law. Prior to that, there had been a separate law for derivatives and for securities, and there were two separate exchanges. Once the law was merged, the two exchanges also merged, and it was just simply a recognition that there is no fundamental distinction there at all."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right. How about Canada?"
"Mr. Clark","Well, unfortunately, we are the worst of all. We have multiple security regulators in Canada."
"Chairman Lieberman","Worse than the United States."
"Mr. Clark","Worse than the United States in this----"
"Chairman Lieberman","That is very interesting. Mr. Clark . One respect, I would have to say. So I think we are trying to get a national regulator."
"Chairman Lieberman","So is it----"
"Mr. Clark","State level, essentially, and so this has been an industry for 40 years to try to get this problem solved. I think the current government is working very hard to see whether they can get this reformed and have a national regulator. But it has faced enormous political disagreement on it because of state rights, essentially. And so I would say that is, if we were looking for black holes in Canada, the fact that we do not have a national regulator. And if you take a look at the one major crisis Canada did have around asset- backed paper, certainly a contributing factor was that there was no federal regulation of this. This was all done at the provincial level and so escaped--so it was--I think it represents a black hole example."
"Chairman Lieberman","Mr. Nason, I take it that historically the reason we had both the SEC and the CFTC is that the CFTC grew up from the trading in agricultural commodities and they did not want to be mixed with the Wall Street regulators."
"Mr. Nason","Historically, that is the genesis of the CFTC's creation in the 1970s. But, interestingly enough, when the CFTC was being created, Members of Congress and their staffs asked the SEC if they wanted the jurisdiction for agricultural commodities, and they declined because it was a specialized market."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Nason","But now I think the volume of financial futures on the futures exchanges is well over 90 percent; whereas, in the 1970s it was significantly bifurcated between financial and agriculture."
"Chairman Lieberman","Yes. I think this has a lot of logic, but it is going to be, for those historical reasons, difficult here. And we can already see not just the regulated entities but the Members of Congress fighting for the status quo; that is, the Agriculture Committee fighting to keep a separate CFTC. Of course, Senator Collins and I think that is why this Committee has a unique role to play, because we have no vested interest on either side--at least not in this matter. We may in other matters. Let me go on to ask Mr. Green, Dr. Carmichael, and Mr. Clark about what I would call transition challenges. As we are heading toward a time of reform, both regulatory and structural, I wonder if you could give us any counsel about transition problems that your countries faced, particularly the two of you, during the transition to a more consolidated regulatory system and any warnings you would give us as a result."
"Mr. Green","We had a Big Bang in the United Kingdom under very unusual circumstances. It was not prepared by a great deal of discussion, but it was accepted almost without subsequent debate because so many parties thought that it solved a lot of prior problems. So there was, if you like, a consensus that the previous arrangements were unsatisfactory, and there were a lot of attractions in what was being done then. There was a big advantage, though, in that because there was almost no warning, and the government was able to decide, using its parliamentary majority, that this would happen. The people just had to get on with it, and the organizations were thrown together and told they had to come up with a solution. There was not any alternative. You are not in that position in the United States. I suppose the lesson that one would draw from it is that if it is at all possible to start with a structure that, rather as I said in my earlier remarks, does not have one organization clearly in the lead, but you are building a true merger and a new structure out of that, there may be a greater chance of success. But the historical circumstances were quite unusual in that respect."
"Chairman Lieberman","Dr. Carmichael, in addition to responding to that, I wonder if you would talk just a little bit about what the opinion is in Australia now about whether this was a good move to go to the so-called twin peaks, in the government, amongst the public, and I suppose in the regulated community."
"Mr. Carmichael","Anytime you have change, you are going to have some difficulty, and I have been through this not only twice in Australia with regulatory amalgamation, but in about half a dozen countries where I have worked as well. So I have seen some of the problems that can arise firsthand. Two of the biggest ones are fear--and that is mainly among staff--fear for jobs, and fear for where they will end up in the new structure."
"Chairman Lieberman","Right."
"Mr. Carmichael","And the second is distraction. Regulators have a job to do, a day job, which is regulation, but they are distracted because of the reorganization and the rebuilding. So those are two very big considerations that you have to deal with in any change."
"Chairman Lieberman","Did previous agencies disappear, as I take it they did, in the United Kingdom?"
"Mr. Carmichael","Some did."
"Chairman Lieberman","But some continued."
"Mr. Carmichael","Yes."
"Chairman Lieberman","They were just put into one of the peaks."
"Mr. Carmichael","We plucked parts of the central bank and parts of some of the State regulators and put them together into a national regulator. We only had one major institutional rebuild. The others were sort of tinkered with at the edges. If reform happened here it would be a much more extensive rebuilding than that because of the sheer number of agencies that you have. But there are two things that in my experience have been absolutely critical to getting to the end without falling over. First is leadership--we have found that if you identify the people who are going to be the leaders of the new organizations, you have to do that early and you have to put them in place to drive the changes because there are always people who will resist the change and undermine the process. You do not want them anywhere around when you are doing it. So there is a need to make the big decisions early on and then to get on with it. The second one is communication--so that people understand what is happening, and they get involved with it. The more you can involve staff in the new structure, the more they will feel ownership for it and be a part of it. I should mention two other things. Mr. Green mentioned Big Bang. In the United Kingdom, they did a Big Bang in terms of making the decision very quickly. In terms of moving to a new internal structure, the FSA moved in gradual steps over quite a long period of time. We used a very different approach. We just kept the agencies separate for a year. We brought them together in name but people kept doing their old jobs for that year. We redesigned how we wanted the agency to look at the end of that. And at the end of the first year, we basically sacked everyone and invited them to apply for new jobs in the new agency. And for 2 weeks I did not sleep, not knowing whether we would actually have an agency at the end of the process. I would not recommend that approach. It worked, but I would not recommend it for anyone else. The last point I would make before getting to your comment about whether it was a success is about legal elements, and I speak here as a non-lawyer, but I have learned to respect law much more over the last 10 or 15 years than I ever did. It was a mistake in Australia to create the agency just with a piece of enabling legislation that set it up, said what its powers were, but left it to operate under each of the individual industry acts that were already in place. So we still had a banking act and a general insurance act and so on. What we have done in a couple of other countries is take each of those pieces of legislation and, before creating the agency, take all of the regulatory powers out of those and move them up into the agency's act. The power of that is just incredible. For example, when we first wanted to create a new governance standard for all of our industries, my lawyers said, ``I am sorry, Chairman. You cannot do that. You have to issue it under each of the different pieces of legislation, and some of them do not even give you the power to do that.'' So the ability to create a harmonized approach in Australia was severely handicapped by the law. Now, the United Kingdom went about it another way--they created an omnibus act. It was very painful, but the outcome was very strong. So legal elements are important. I would encourage you, if you go this route, to get the legislation running ahead of the agency, if you can. Get the legal side sorted out so that the agency has the powers to do what it needs to do. You asked whether it was a good move. The answer is undoubtedly, yes. Our Prime Minister in Australia and our Treasurer are out around the world crowing about how great our system has been. If you wound the clock back 2 years ago, they were still grumbling that the system belonged to their predecessors, who were of a different party. The story has changed enormously."
"Chairman Lieberman","That is powerful testimony. Thank you."
"Senator Collins",""
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Carmichael, let me take up where the Chairman left off. Your four peaks or twin peaks approach has a lot of appeal to me, but I am wondering, as someone who spent 5 years overseeing financial regulation in the State of Maine, how it works for the regulatory community. If you have separate regulators, do you also have separate compliance audits? In other words, in Maine, when we would send out our bank auditors to review the State-chartered banks for compliance, they did the entire audit because it was only that one agency plus there was a Federal agency involved as well. But if you have separate regulators for prudential regulation competition, are you having multiple audits?"
"Mr. Carmichael","The answer is yes, but ``multiple'' is a very small number in that our prudential regulator has the primary responsibility for on-site inspections. And I should say we are much more of a principles-based than a rules-based country, so we do not do anything like as many audits and on- site inspections as would be common under the U.S. approach. Our conduct regulator, which is the pillar that looks at mis-selling and mis-pricing of products, works on the basis of responding to complaints. So they are not out there auditing complaints as such. They will hear a complaint, and they are really looking for misconduct of a type. Then they will do an investigation. So it is very targeted. It is not a regular on- site audit of that style. So in the sense of overlap, it is really quite minimal."
"Senator Collins","I also recall when I was head of the Financial Department that we would have regulated entities say, well, we are going to consider becoming federally chartered unless you do X. So there is a real problem in our country with shopping for the easiest regulator and playing the States off against the Federal regulators and vice versa. And because that is an income stream to the regulator, those threats matter to State governments, particularly State governments that are strapped for funds. So I think that is an issue as well. Mr. Nason, in the United States we now recognize that a large shadow banking sector can threaten the entire financial sector, and I, for one, believe that it is not enough to monitor just the safety and soundness of traditional banks, but we need to extend safety and soundness regulation to investment banks, for example, to subsidiaries of companies like AIG. Bear Stearns, I am told, had an astonishing leverage ratio of 30:1 when it failed. Do you think that we should be extending some system of capital requirements across the financial sector?"
"Mr. Nason","That is a great and very difficult question. If you go back to Bear Stearns, Bear Stearns was under a consolidated supervisory system that was administered by the SEC, so they did have liquidity and capital requirements that were different than the banking system, but they were under some type of conglomerate supervision. I think generally if you are a systemically important institution, it is hard to argue that you should not be under some type of systemic supervision to prevent hurting the general economy. What gets harder is where do you draw the line between which types of institutions gets safety and soundness supervision and which do not? For example, a very easy case is some hedge funds, you can make an argument that they are systemically important because of their size or concentration in particular markets. They could probably be subjected to some type of supervision. Should all hedge funds be subjected to that type of supervision? The case is harder the smaller they become. So the way that we cut it in the Blueprint is that institutions would all need to be licensed, chartered, and under the supervision of our systemic regulator. But that type of systemic regulation was different than traditional prudential safety and soundness regulation."
"Senator Collins","It, of course, gets very complicated very quickly because if you designate certain financial institutions as systemically important and, thus, make them subject to safety and soundness regulation, you are also sending a message that they are too big to fail--a very bad message to send because then you are creating moral hazard. This is so complicated to figure out the right answer here, but I do think it is significant that the Canadian banks, with their higher capital requirements and the ability to hold lower-return assets, lower-risk assets, and lower leverage ratios compared to American banks, were healthier. They did not fail. So, clearly, there has got to be a lesson for us there. Mr. Clark, I know we are running out of time, but I do want to talk to you further about the lending practices. I completely agree with my colleague from Missouri that part of the problem with the American mortgage system was that risk and responsibility were divorced, so you had a mortgage broker who was making the loan, gets his or her cut, then sells it to the bank, which gets its cut, which then sells it to the secondary market. Everyone is getting a financial reward, but ultimately no one is responsible for the mortgage if it goes bad. There is no skin in the game, which I think is a big problem, although difficult to solve because of the liquidity issues that Mr. Nason raised. But there are other key differences as well that you talked to me about when we were in my office, and they had to do with downpayment levels, mortgage insurance, and deductibility of interest. Could you discuss some of the differences between Canadian and American mortgage lending?"
"Mr. Clark","Maybe I should just mention one other feature that I have not underscored but we found a tremendous difference on the two sides of the border. In Canada, because we hold all the mortgages, modifying the mortgages is easy to do. We do not have to ask anyone's permission to modify the mortgage. And it is not the government coming to us and saying, ``Would you start? Here is our modification program.'' We just were instantly modifying the mortgages. Last year, we represented about 20 percent of the mortgage market in Canada. We only foreclosed on 1,000 homes in a whole year, to give you an order of magnitude. And every one of those thousand we regarded as a failure. And so the last thing we would ever want to do is actually foreclose on a good customer. And so we go out of our way to modify the mortgages, and that is just natural practice for us because I do not have to ask permission of some investor whether or not I want to do this or can do it or what rules are governing it. So I do think that has turned out in this crisis to be a second feature that, frankly, none of us would have thought about until the current crisis. In terms of our specifics, we are required, if we, in fact, lend more than 80 percent loan-to-value, to actually insure the mortgage so that represents a constraint. It would not have represented a constraint to the kind of no documentation lending that was done in the United States because the actual underwriting we are doing. But then again, because we actually would be holding the mortgages, we insisted on full documentation. There is not interest deductibility. I think there is no question that the feature of having interest deductibility in the United States is a major factor for leveraging up. And despite the fact that it is justified on the basis that it encourages homeownership, historically homeownership has actually been higher in Canada than it has been in the United States. So there is no evidence that the two are linked at all. All it does is inflate housing prices because, in fact, people look at the after-tax cost in computing the value on which they are to bid for the houses. So I would say those are the main features. We do have mortgage brokers, but they are originating mortgages which we then hold. We do not sell them on. And I think that is the core feature."
"Senator Collins","And just to clarify, in most cases the homebuyer is putting down 20 percent. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Clark","Yes. Although when I started my first house, I bought the insurance and put down less than 20 percent. But you can do it. But, again, we would not lend to that person unless we were sure they were going to pay us back because we are responsible for the collections, we are responsible for managing that, and it is really our customer relationship, which is how we regard it."
"Senator Collins","I think it is fascinating that homeownership levels are actually higher in Canada than in the United States, because the justification for all these policies that encouraged the subprime mortgage market was to increase homeownership. And, in fact, it has caused a lot of people to lose homes that they could not afford in the first place, and the Canadian experience is very instructive. Mr. Green, last question to you. In the United Kingdom, what are the lending policies? Are they more similar to the Canadian practices or to the American practices?"
"Mr. Green","A mixture. There is also no interest deductibility in the United Kingdom, though that has not stopped a boom in house prices. There has been no regulation of the terms of lending, and one of the issues that has arisen in the review that the FSA has undertaken of what went wrong and what might need to change--which I commend to you, it is a very detailed review covering many of the issues we have talked about today--is whether there should be some kind of mandatory loan-to-value ratios or loan-to-income ratios. So they were not in place, but that is seriously being considered. What has now been agreed at the European level is that there will be skin in the game and that the originator in securitization will have to maintain 5 percent. And I think I am right in saying that has now been legislated across the European Union because of a rather widespread perception that this was a problem that needed fixing. You may say 5 percent is only symbolic, but, of course, it will concentrate the minds of the management to all the issues that Dr. Clark has mentioned."
"Senator Collins","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Lieberman","Thanks very much, Senator Collins. Thanks to our four witnesses. Thanks for the trouble you took to come here, for the time you spent with us, and, most of all, for sharing your experiences and opinions. I found this to be a very helpful hearing. Even you, Mr. Nason, who did not come that far. We appreciate your testimony. And at the risk of simplifying it, I think in various ways your testimony has shown us that structure matters, obviously regulation does, too, that you need a healthy combination of both, and that none is a cure-all. You cannot assume that a good regulatory structure will solve all the problems. But it will solve some of them, and it will prevent others from occurring or make it harder for others to occur. I think you have helped clarify opinions up here, so we thank you very much. It is our normal course to keep the record of the hearing open for 15 days for any additional questions or statements. If you have any second thoughts you want to add to the printed record--all your prepared statements, which were excellent, will be printed in the record in full. It may be that some Members of the Committee, those who were here and those who were not, would file some questions with you, and if you have the chance, it would be appreciated if you would answer them for the record. But, really, our thanks, and I hope you will both watch with interest as we proceed to attempt to reform and say a prayer for us as well. The hearing is adjourned. Thank you."
