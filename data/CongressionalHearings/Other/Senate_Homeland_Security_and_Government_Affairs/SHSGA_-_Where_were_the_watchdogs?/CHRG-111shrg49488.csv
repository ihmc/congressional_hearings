Speaker,Speech
Chairman Lieberman," The hearing will come to order. Good afternoon, and a special welcome to our guests, three of whom have come from farther than normal to testify--and without being summoned here by force of law, I might add. So we are particularly grateful that you are here.
    This is our Committee's third in a series of hearings examining the structure of our financial regulatory system; how that flawed structure contributed to the system's failure to anticipate and prevent the current economic crisis; and, most importantly, looking forward, what kind of structure is needed to strengthen financial oversight. You will note that I used the word ``structure'' at least three times here, and this is because that is the unique function and jurisdiction that our Committee has. We understand that the Banking Committee in particular is leading the effort to review regulations in this field, but we are charged with the responsibility to oversee the organization of government, and we have tried to come at this matter of financial regulatory reform with a focus on that as opposed to the particular regulations.
    We learned from our previous hearings that our current regulatory system has evolved in a haphazard manner, not just over the 10, 20, or 30 years some of us have been here, but over the last 150 years, largely in response usually to whatever the latest crisis was to hit our Nation and threaten its financial stability.
    As a result, we have here a financial regulatory system that is both fragmented and outdated. Numerous Federal and State agencies share responsibility for regulating financial institutions and markets, creating both redundancies in some ways and gaps in others--gaps particularly over significant activities and businesses, and redundancies, too, such as consumer protection enforcement, hedge funds, and credit default swaps. Our current crisis has clearly exposed many of these problems.
    To strengthen our financial regulatory system, an array of interested parties--academics, policymakers, even business people--from across the political spectrum has called for significant structural reorganization. So as we move forward and consider this question, it seemed to Senator Collins and me that it would be very helpful for us to examine the experiences of other nations around the world, and that is the purpose of today's hearing and why we are so grateful to the four of you.
    Over the past few years, the United Kingdom, Australia, and other countries have dramatically reformed their financial regulatory systems. They have merged agencies, reconsidered their fundamental approaches to regulation, and streamlined their regulatory structures. Many people believe that these reforms have resulted in a more efficient and effective use of regulatory resources and certainly more clearly defined roles for regulators.
    The American economy is different in size, of course, and in scope from all the others, but there is still much we can learn by studying the examples of these free market partners of ours. We really have an impressive panel of witnesses today, each of whom has not only thought extensively about the different ways in which a country can structure its financial regulatory system, but also played a role in that system. And I would imagine that you all bear some scars from trying to change the regulatory status quo.
    I would also imagine that you know what we have learned here, that reorganizations are complicated and very difficult. Our Committee learned this firsthand through its role in creating and overseeing the Department of Homeland Security and in reforming our Nation's intelligence community in response to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. But reorganizations can also pay dividends and result in a more effective, responsive, efficient, and transparent government, and of course, that is what we hope for in the area of financial regulation.
    I am confident in the work that our colleagues on the Senate Banking Committee are doing to address the financial regulations, but as I said at the outset, we are focused here on structure, and the two are clearly tightly interwoven. If we want to minimize the likelihood of severe financial crises in the future, we need to both reform our regulations and improve the architecture of our financial regulators. As Treasury Secretary Geithner and the Obama Administration prepare to announce their own plan for comprehensive reform in the weeks ahead, the testimony presented here today will help ensure that we are cognizant of what has and has not worked abroad, and that surely can help us guide our efforts and the Administration's and clarify for us all which reforms, regulatory and structural, will work best here in the United States of America.
    Senator Collins.
              OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Chairman, as you mentioned, this is the third in a series of hearings held by our Committee to examine America's financial crisis, and I commend you for your leadership in convening this series of hearings because I believe that until we reform our financial regulatory system, we are not going to address some of the root causes of the current financial crisis. Our prior hearings have reviewed the causes of the crisis and whether a systemic risk regulator and other reforms might have helped prevent it.
    Testimony at these hearings has demonstrated that, for the most part, financial regulators in our country failed to foresee the coming financial meltdown. No one regulator was responsible for the oversight of all the sectors of our financial market, and none of our regulators alone could have taken comprehensive, decisive action to prevent or mitigate the impact of the collapse. These oversight gaps and the lack of attention to systemic risk undermined our financial markets. Congress, working with the Administration, must act to help put in place regulatory reforms to help prevent future meltdowns like this one.
    Based on our prior hearings and after consulting with a wide range of financial experts, in March, I introduced the Financial System Stabilization and Reform Act. This bill would establish a Financial Stability Council that would be charged with identifying and taking action to prevent or mitigate systemic threats to our financial markets. The council would help to ensure that high-risk financial products and practices could be detected in time to prevent their contagion from spreading to otherwise healthy financial institutions and markets.
    This legislation would fundamentally restructure our financial regulatory system, help restore stability to our markets, and begin to rebuild the public confidence in our economy. The concept of a council to assess overall systemic risk has garnered support from within the financial regulatory community. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Chair Mary Schapiro, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) Chair Sheila Bair are among those who support creating some form of a systemic risk council in order to avoid an excessive concentration of power in any one financial regulator, yet take advantage of the expertise of all the financial regulators.
    As we continue to search for solutions to this economic crisis, it is instructive for us to look outside our borders at the financial systems of other nations.
    The distinguished panel of witnesses that we will hear from today will testify about the financial regulatory systems of the United Kingdom, Canada, and Australia. They will also provide a broader view of global financial structures. We can learn some valuable lessons from studying their best practices. Canada's banking system, for example, has been ranked as the strongest in the world, while ours is ranked only as number 40.
    I am very pleased that Edmund Clark has joined the other experts at the panel. It was through a meeting in my office when he started describing the differences between the Canadian system of regulation, financial practices, and mortgage practices versus our system that I became very interested in having him share his expertise officially, and I am grateful that he was able to change his schedule to be here on relatively short notice. I am also looking forward to hearing from the other experts that we have convened here today.
    America's Main Street small businesses, homeowners, employees, savers, and investors deserve the protection of an effective regulatory system that modernizes regulatory agencies, sets safety and soundness requirements for financial institutions to prevent excessive risk taking, and improves oversight, accountability, and transparency. This Committee's ongoing investigation will continue to shed light on how the current crisis evolved and focus attention on the reforms that are needed in the structure and regulatory apparatus to restore the confidence of the American people in our financial system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you, Senator Collins. Thanks for that thoughtful statement.
    Let us go to the witnesses now. First we welcome David Green, who was Head of International Policy at the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority (FSA) after having previously spent three decades at the Bank of England. Mr. Green currently works for England's Financial Reporting Council. It is an honor to have you here, and we would invite your testimony now. TESTIMONY OF DAVID W. GREEN,\1\ FORMER HEAD OF INTERNATIONAL 
      POLICY, FINANCIAL SERVICES AUTHORITY, UNITED KINGDOM
"
Mr. Green," Thank you, Chairman. I give testimony, of course, as a private individual, having worked in those institutions you described. I also give testimony as a co-author with Sir Howard Davies of a book on global financial regulation which discusses a lot of the issues that are before the Committee today. The views expressed here are entirely my own, of course, and not those of any of the organizations I have been associated with.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Green appears in the Appendix on page 311.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    There is remarkable biodiversity in arrangements for financial regulation at a global level. There are essentially four main types of structure to be found, with multiple variants. There is the sectoral type, with separate regimes for banking, securities, and insurance, which can be found in France, Italy, or Spain. There is the so-called ``twin peaks'' type to be found in Australia or, in alternative versions, in Canada and the Netherlands; the integrated type, which can be found in Germany, Japan, Scandinavia, and, indeed, in the United Kingdom. Then there is perhaps another fourth type, where the United States might fit, with extraordinary diversity.
    When I was in the FSA, we thought we probably had over a hundred counterpart regulatory bodies in the United States.
    Then there is the role of the central bank, which may or may not have responsibility for some, many, or, indeed, all aspects of supervision, as it does in Singapore, for instance.
    Probably the most advanced form of the integrated regulator can be found in the FSA, where it was created remarkably rapidly when the incoming Labour Government simply decided in 1997, without real debate, that at the same time as giving the Bank of England independence in the implementation of monetary policy, it would also create a single regulator for financial services. That was set in train and eventually subsumed 11 prior agencies, and a single new piece of legislation was drafted completely de novo with new objectives for regulation and with a set of principles drafted to guide the regulators.
    Not all of integrated regulators have that single piece of legislation, and they carry on with sectoral legislation. That is obviously an issue to be thought about when the Committee addresses the legislative structure that is put in place.
    The bodies were merged in a way which enabled prior existing bodies simply not to be visible anymore. There was full integration. You cannot find within the regulator the bodies that were there before, and that was quite deliberate so that no impression should be created of one of the prior entities somehow taking over the others.
    The rationale for integrated regulation was set out by the FSA, and in my written testimony, I set out the main arguments, but the core ones, as you know, are that financial conglomerates, in particular, undertake a range of banking, insurance, and investment business. The markets themselves have instruments which mingle features of all those. And it was difficult to carry on regulating on a purely functional basis when that no longer matched the structures of either firms or markets.
    Integration makes it possible to align the regulatory structure with the way the firms manage themselves so that this should help with the proper understanding of the overall business model and of overall risks. It also means that a regulated firm only needs to deal with one agency for all its regulatory business, ideally through relationship managers on both sides.
    An integrated regulator ought to be able to manage the conflicts which inevitably arise between the different objectives of regulation, and we will no doubt discuss that later. The concept underlying a single regulator is that these conflicts exist but need to be managed in one place or another, and there have been in the United Kingdom adverse experiences in the management of those conflicts in the past, which is one of the reasons why the intention was to put them together.
    As regards the role of the central bank, there are a number of issues about the possible conflict of interest which might take place with the independent conduct of monetary policy. Monetary policy might be tempted to look more after the regulated community than the wider interest. And those arguments are a little bit more difficult to be certain about.
    How has the model stood up? Previously, the model was very widely praised. Since the crisis, like of regulators in many places, there has been very wide criticism. But much of the criticism can be pinned down to failures, if you like, at the global level with the international capital rules regarded as having fallen short. Markets were inadequately understood. The way securitization would work and how markets would behave was very widely misunderstood. That has been a common problem. The FSA also made mistakes in not doing what it was supposed to do, simple internal management mistakes.
    There has been a lot of work done to go over the lessons of the crisis. Both the FSA and the Bank of England have undertaken work to see whether the structure of regulation has identified any patterns of superior models as a result of the crisis, and no patterns have been found. The Bank of England did do some work--which I think I can make available to the Committee--which finds no pattern at all as between integrated, prudential, twin peaks regulator, and sectoral regulator. I think the conclusion has been that the model itself is not really seen to have been implicated in the way the crisis unfolded, and, indeed, the fact that banking, securities, and insurance were all interlinked in the crisis in some people's minds has reinforced the underlying concept.
    Obviously, I would be very happy to answer further questions as the hearing proceeds. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you. That was most interesting and a good beginning. So at this state, we would say that, in your opinion, which one of these regulatory systems was chosen did not have much of an effect on the economic crisis that occurred.
"
Mr. Green," That appears to be the case. You can find a number of examples, if you take them in isolation, which reinforce a particular argument. But if you look across the board, you do not find a pattern. The Bank of England work that I referred to, which I am sorry I do not have available here, looked at, I think, about 40 or 50 different jurisdictions and could find no pattern related to structure.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Yes.
"
Mr. Green," And the FSA work has shown that there have been problems when supervision was inside the central bank and when it was outside, and, again, no clear pattern can be found.
"
Chairman Lieberman," That is interesting. I normally would hold the questions until after everyone testifies and then I come back. That does not mean that there are not preferences for one over the other form of regulation.
    I also wanted to thank you for your graciousness in describing the American system as ``diversified.'' That was nicely done. [Laughter.]
    Second we have Dr. Jeffrey Carmichael, the inaugural chairman of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, with responsibility for regulating and supervising banks, insurance companies, and pension funds. Dr. Carmichael currently works in Singapore as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Promontory Financial Group Australasia.
    Thank you for being here.  TESTIMONY OF JEFFREY CARMICHAEL, PH.D.,\1\ CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
        OFFICER, PROMONTORY FINANCIAL GROUP AUSTRALASIA
"
Mr. Carmichael," Thank you, Chairman, and let me say what a pleasure it is to be here.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Carmichael appears in the Appendix on page 318.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Our government implemented a new structure in the middle of 1998. Unlike the experience that Mr. Green just referred to where the United Kingdom Government did it very quickly, ours was the outcome of a committee that sat for almost 12 months looking at the options, and it was a great privilege for me to have been a member of that committee.
    The new structure that was put in place realigned a previous structure a little bit like your own. It was an institutionally based structure. It was a hybrid structure of bits and pieces. We had State regulation as well as Federal regulation. What came out of the reorganization is what has become known as an ``objectives-based'' or a twin peaks type model. We do not like the term twin peaks because we actually have four peaks, so we think that is undercounting.
    But the four agencies that were put in place were:
    First, a competition regulator that sat over the entire system, not only the financial sector but the whole economy;
    Second, a securities and investments commission, think of a combination of your SEC and the futures regulator. They had responsibility across all financial sectors for conduct, including financial institutions, markets, and participants;
    The third was the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA), the one with which I was involved. We had responsibility for the prudential soundness of all deposit taking, insurance, and pensions;
    And the fourth was the central bank, which was given, of course, systemic responsibility for monetary policy, liquidity support, and regulation of the payment system.
    Over the top of that was a coordinating body, called the Council of Financial Regulators, which includes the Department of Treasury as well, and that is a very important add-on.
    The defining characteristic of this architecture--and I should add this is in some ways very similar to your plan that was proposed by Former Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson earlier in 2008, but with a couple of important differences, which we can talk about later--is that it was unique in the world at the time it was put in place in Australia, and so far as we know, only one country--and that is the Netherlands--would claim to have the same structure in totality. The Canadian structure is similar, but a little bit less consistent.
    The Australian banks under this structure, for example, are subject to all four regulators. They have competition covered by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC), their conduct by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), their prudence by APRA, and if there is a liquidity support or payment system issue, they go to the Reserve Bank. So that is the defining characteristic of this model, that multiple agencies are responsible for each institution, but for a different part of their behavior or their activities. And there is a fairly clear dividing line between those activities.
    Some of the advantages that we see in this structure--and some of these, of course, are shared by other models such as the British one--include:
    First, by assigning each regulatory agency to a single objective--that is either competition or prudence--it avoids the conflict of objectives that you face under virtually any other system. So each regulator has just one thing to worry about, and that avoids getting into some of the issues, for example, that Northern Rock brought out, for the FSA.
    Second, in bringing all regulators of a particular objective together, you get synergies. We learned a lot when we brought banking and insurance regulation together, and we were able to develop an approach that took on the best of both of those systems and to develop synergies out of that. Likewise, ASIC, our conduct regulator, was one of the first in the world to introduce a single licensing regime for market participants.
    Third, this structure helped eliminate regulatory arbitrage or jurisdiction shopping of the type that you have seen here. Prior to the creation of APRA there were at least three different types of institutions that could issue deposits in Australia, and they were subject to nine different regulatory agencies, depending on where they were located.
    Following its creation, APRA introduced a fully harmonized regime. We now have a single class of ``deposit-taking institutions.'' We do not distinguish between banks, credit unions, or thrifts. They can take on that separate identity, but they are all regulated as deposit takers.
    Fourth, by bringing together all of the prudentially regulated institutions under the one regulatory roof, we have a more consistent and effective approach to regulating financial conglomerates, and along with countries like the United Kingdom and Canada, Australia has been at the forefront of developing the approach to conglomerate supervision.
    Fifth, allocating a single objective to each regulator minimizes the overlap between agencies and the inevitable turf wars that are associated with that, which I am sure you are very familiar with.
    Interesting for us in our experience was that the gray areas between the agencies have tended to diminish over time rather than to increase, and I think that has been a little bit of a surprise, but a very welcome surprise to those of us who were involved with the design.
    Sixth, the allocation of a single objective to each agency minimizes cultural clashes, and one of the issues that we were very conscious of in creating the distinction between prudential and conduct regulation was that, while conduct regulation tends to be carried out by lawyers, prudential regulation tends to be carried out in general by accountants and finance and economics experts--with the exception of the United States, where lawyers tend to do it all. So, culturally, we found it was very useful to separate these two types of regulators so that we did not have those cultural battles.
    Finally, by streamlining our old state-based, or partly state-based, regulatory system, we got a lot of cost efficiencies out of it, and we were able to facilitate strong financial sector development and innovation without having to reduce safety and soundness in the process.
    In terms of outcomes, our architecture has weathered the recent financial storm better than most. Indeed, I believe our four major banks are still among the few AA-rated banks left in the world.
    The resilience of our system was helped by exceptionally tough prudential standards, particularly in the areas of capital and securitization. There was also inevitably some good luck as well as good management. I am not going to claim it was all brilliance.
    In terms of crisis management, the coordination arrangements worked exceptionally well and, I am told, in speaking with each of the agencies recently, that they found the singularity of objectives helped them enormously in terms of coordination among the different agencies in the crisis.
    On the less positive side, like everyone else, we have learned that regulators and industry know much less about risk than we thought we did. We have had to think about the way risk is measured and regulated. Most importantly, we have learned that financial stability regulation is a much bigger challenge than we thought it was, and there is a lot still to be learned there. And to borrow the Churchillian phrase, we regulators have learned that ``we have much about which to be modest.''
    In concluding, Mr. Chairman, I would like to offer two very general observations. The first echoes a point you made in your opening statement. There can be little dispute that regulatory architecture matters. It is very important. There is no perfect architecture. There is no one size fits all. But there are certainly some architectures that are virtually guaranteed to fail under sufficient pressure.
    That said, architecture is only half the story. A sound architecture is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for effective regulation. The other component, which you mentioned, is how you implement and enforce those regulations, and it is very important that these two components are considered in tandem and not in isolation.
    Finally, it is easier to tinker with the architecture than to do major reform. Major reform is largely about opportunity. The window for reform is usually only open very briefly. You have, arguably, the widest window for reform since the Great Depression. This crisis provides you with the public support and, I believe, the industry acquiescence to challenge the vested interests and inertia that normally make major reform of the type you have seen in some other countries all but impossible. And I am sure I speak for many of my colleagues in the international regulatory community, in hoping that this opportunity is not lost. Thank you.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you very much. Well said. I have many concerns, but one clearly is that the result of this crisis will be that we will change some regulations, some law, but we will not change the regulatory structure very much because of the resistance of those in the financial communities but also, frankly, here in Congress to changing the status quo. So your words are very much on target. I thank you.
    Our third witness is Dr. Edmund Clark, President and CEO of the TD Bank Financial Group in Canada. Mr. Clark has had a long and distinguished career in both the Canadian Government and private industry, and we are very grateful that you are here today. Please proceed.  TESTIMONY OF W. EDMUND CLARK, PH.D.,\1\ PRESIDENT AND CHIEF 
           EXECUTIVE OFFICER, TD BANK FINANCIAL GROUP
"
Mr. Clark," Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Collins, for inviting me, and thank you to the other Members. I am obviously not here as a regulatory expert, but we have a wonderful panel.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Clark appears in the Appendix on page 326.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     I am going to speak much more as a CEO who operates under the regulatory regimes. We are a little unusual in the sense that we operate on both sides of the border in Canada and the United States. We have over 1,000 branches in the United States from Maine to Florida, and we are a bank in the United States that is continuing to lend, and lend aggressively. So we have double-digit lending growth, and we are one of the few AAA-rated banks left in the world. We exited the structured products area in 2005, the source of most of the problems.
    I thought I would comment on a couple of things, and one was the actual management of the crisis from the beginning of August 2007 until now, and I think what certainly distinguished the Canadian system, which may not be duplicable in larger countries, is that the six banks plus the Bank of Canada, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions (OSFI), and the Department of Finance essentially worked almost continuously together and have a shared objective. There was a very strong feeling among us that if any one of our banks ran into trouble, we would all run into trouble. So there was no attempt by one bank to, in a sense, game the system, and there was also fairly quickly a view that we should try to have a private sector solution to this problem, not a public sector solution; and to the extent we involved the public sector, it should be a profitable involvement on behalf of the taxpayers, not a subsidy, and we were able to successfully do that.
    In terms of the structure of the industry, I think it is well known that there are some important differences. All the major dealers are owned by the Canadian banks, and we did, in fact, absorb $18 billion (CAD) of write-offs by these dealers. TD Bank did not have any significant write-offs, but $18 billion (CAD) is a significant amount in the size of Canada, but they were able to absorb that because they were tied to large entities with very stable retail earnings.
    Second, the mortgage market is completely different in Canada. It is concentrated in the top banks, and we originate mortgages to hold them. And so we have resisted attempts--frankly, political attempts--to have us loosen standards because we are going to bear the risks of those loosened standards. So you did not get the development in Canada of what you did in the United States.
    Third, in terms of the capital requirements, our capital requirements have always been above world standards, with a particular emphasis on common equity. But it has also been reinforced by the insistence of our regulation that we have our own self-assessment of how much capital we need, and that in all cases, it caused Canadian banks to hold more than regulatory minimums, not at regulatory minimums.
    I think the other difference would be that our regime's binding constraint is risk-weighted assets, and that is a key feature why we hold our mortgages rather than sell them. Where you have total asset tests, you, in fact, encourage banks to sell low-risk assets, and where we have a total asset test is not the binding constraint.
    In terms of the nature of the regulatory regime, it is a principles regime, not a rule-based regime--it is rather light in terms of the actual number of people employed in the regulatory regime. There is a high focus on ensuring that management and the board know and understand the risks that the institution is taking and that, in fact, they are building the infrastructure to monitor and manage that risk.
    The way I put it internally in my organization is I am actually on the side of the regulator, not on the side of the bank. We have the same interest in ensuring that the bank does not run into trouble, and do you have less of this conflict situation because I see the regulator as helping me manage the bank.
    I think another important element that Canada moved to in terms of compensation some time ago was to have low cash bonuses. So in my case, 70 percent of my pay would be in the form of equity which I hold. I am required to hold my economic interests in the bank for 2 years after I retire, so I cannot cut and run. And all my executives, whether in the wholesale side of the bank or the retail side of the bank, are paid on the whole bank's performance, including its ability to deliver great customer satisfaction. We also have separation of the chairman from the CEO, and all board and committee meetings have meetings without management present to ensure that independence.
    Clearly, the issue, I think, you are addressing is the issue of systemic risk, and I think it is the toughest issue to deal with here. I think I would have to be in the camp to say all the systemic risk issues were well known and well talked about. It is not as if there was this mystery out there that the U.S. mortgage system was, in fact, going way up the risk curve and doing what most bankers would have regarded as crazy lending. It is not as if there was not meeting after meeting among bankers around the world about the risks that are inherent in structured products. And I would say the under-saving feature of the U.S. economy was a well-known fact. And so I think you do have to sit back and say, well, if these risks were well known, why were there no, in a sense, forces against that?
    I can comment on our own experience. As I indicated, we did actually exit these products. We exited them because they were hard to understand. They embedded tail risk and added a lot of complexity to the organization. We also refused to, in fact, distribute the asset-backed paper program that blew up in Canada on the basis that if I would not sell it to my mother-in-law, I should not sell it to my clients.
    But the real issue is that in doing that, that was a very unpopular thing to do. It was unpopular within my bank. It was unpopular among my investors. It is very hard to run against these tides, and so I think when you are talking about systemic risk, you have to recognize that there is this odd confluence of political, economic, and profit force actually always propelling it. It is like a lot of the literature, what creates boom. You have the same thing behind any forces of systemic risk.
    So what is my conclusion as a practicer in the field? Well, I do not think there is one answer because, as I have said, banks have failed under most regulatory regimes. But I do think a strong regulator is important, and you certainly should not allow regulatory shopping. I think that is obviously a very bad thing.
    And while rules are important, I actually think principles do matter. It was clear throughout the industry that people were in the process of using regulatory capital arbitrage, and if you sat there from a principle point of view, I think you might have stopped it.
    Leadership matters enormously. I think boards should be held accountable to ensure that they actually have a CEO with the right value system. His job is to preserve the institution. And I think it is clear to say while all regulatory regimes may have known about systemic risk, they did not focus on systemic risk. And I think we are lacking mechanisms where, if you did come upon a view that existed, how would you, in fact, coordinate action to bring it to an end?
    I do think going forward, though, there is also a risk that we could overreact, and one of the things I would plead is that many elements of the regulatory reforms could drive institutions to take more risk rather than less risk. And I think you have to be careful in your rules to make sure that low-risk strategies, such as the TD Bank one, are not, in fact, negatively impacted by some of the rule changes. Thank you very much.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you very much. Refreshing. I must say, I did not know how different the regulatory system and some of the rules of behavior were, and it is striking that one of the reasons that Canada did not get into some of the same mortgage problems as we did was really because of regulation, some of the things you were prohibited from doing.
"
Mr. Clark," Right. There was an element of regulation that prohibited us, but also we had a capital regime that said we could hold low-risk assets and not have large amounts of capital. And that is a critical feature to the originate-and-hold model.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you.
    Our final witness this morning is from closer to home. David Nason was at the Treasury Department during March 2008 and before and was very active in the construction of the Treasury Department's March 2008 ``Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure,'' previously known as ``the Paulson plan.'' Mr. Nason is now the Managing Director for Promontory Financial Group here in Washington, DC. We have two of the four witnesses from the Promontory Group. That speaks well for the group.
    Mr. Nason, we welcome your testimony. TESTIMONY OF DAVID G. NASON,\1\ MANAGING DIRECTOR, PROMONTORY

"
Mr. Nason," Thank you for having me. Chairman Lieberman, Ranking Member Collins, and Members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to appear before you today on these important matters. As the United States begins to evaluate its financial regulatory framework, it is vital that it incorporate the lessons and experience from other countries' reform efforts.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Nason appears in the Appendix on page 334.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    I recently, as you just mentioned, finished a 3-year stint at the U.S. Department of the Treasury where I was honored to serve former Secretaries Jon Snow and Henry Paulson. And as the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Institutions, I worked hand in hand with the government as they tried to respond to the financial crisis. More germane to this particular hearing is I am particularly proud to have led the team that researched and wrote the Treasury's ``Blueprint for a Modernized Financial Regulatory Structure,'' which was published in March 2008. And many of the issues that we evaluated in the writing of the Blueprint are before the Congress and the focus of this hearing.
    What seems clear as we think about this issue is that financial institutions play an essential role in a large part of our U.S. economy, and given the economic significance of the sector, it is important that we examine the structure of our regulatory framework as we think about the content of regulations. And this is all the more pressing as the United States begins to emerge from the current financial crisis.
    The root causes of the financial crisis are well documented. Benign economic conditions and plentiful market liquidity led to risk complacency, dramatic weakening of underwriting standards for U.S. mortgages, especially subprime mortgages, and a general loosening of credit terms of loans to households and businesses.
    The confluence of many events led to a significant credit contraction and a dramatic repricing of risk. We are still living through this process right now, and we have seen more government intervention in the financial markets than we have seen in decades.
    The focus of this hearing today is prospective, however, and the financial crisis has told us that regulatory structure is not merely an academic issue and that topics like regulatory arbitrage matter and have meaningful repercussions outside of the province of academia. Indeed, if we look for something positive in the aftermath of the crisis, it might be that it will give us the courage to make the hard choices and reform our financial regulatory architecture.
    We have learned all too well that our regulators and regulations were not well positioned to adapt to the rapid financial innovation driven by capital mobility, deep liquidity, and technology. Regulation alone and modernized architecture could not have prevented all of the problems from these developments. But we can do much better, and we can position ourselves better.
    Our current regulatory structure in the United States no longer reflects the complexity of our markets. This complexity and the severity of the financial crisis pressured the U.S. regulatory structure, exposing regulatory gaps as well as redundancies. Our system, much of it created over 70 years ago, is grappling to keep pace with market evolutions and facing increasing difficulties, at times, in preventing and anticipating financial crises.
    Largely incompatible with these market developments is our current system of functional regulation, which maintains separate regulatory agencies across segregated functional lines of financial services, such as banking, insurance, securities, and futures, with no single regulator possessing all of the information and authority necessary to monitor systemic risk.
    Moreover, our current system results in duplication of certain common activities across regulators. Now, while some degree of specialization might be important for the regulation of financial institutions, many aspects of financial regulation and consumer protection regulation have common themes.
    So as we consider the future construct of our U.S. financial regulation, we should first look to the experience of other countries, especially those that have conducted a thoughtful review recently, like we have heard today. As global financial markets integrate and accounting standards converge, it is only natural for regulatory practices to follow suit. There are two dominant forms of financial regulatory regimes that should be considered seriously in the United States as we rethink our regulatory model. I would like to focus on the consolidated regulator approach and the twin peaks approach.
    Under a single consolidated regulator approach, one regulator responsible for both financial and consumer protection regulation would regulate all financial institutions. The United Kingdom's consolidation of regulation within the FSA exemplifies this approach, although other countries such as Japan have moved in this direction. The general consolidated regulator approach eliminates the role of the central bank from financial institution regulation, but preserves its role in determining monetary policy and performing some functions related to overall financial market stability.
    A key advantage of the consolidated regulator approach that we should consider is enhanced efficiency from combining common functions undertaken by individual regulators into one entity. A consolidated regulator approach should allow for a better understanding of overall risks to the financial system.
    While the consolidated regulator approach benefits are clear, there are also potential problems that we should consider. For example, housing all regulatory functions related to financial and consumer regulation in one entity may lead to varying degrees of focus on these key functions. Also, the scale of operations necessary to establish a single consolidated regulator in the United States could make the model more difficult to implement in comparison to other jurisdictions.
    Another major approach, adopted mostly notably by our colleagues at the table in Australia and in the Netherlands, indeed, is the twin peaks model that emphasizes regulation by objectives. One regulatory body is responsible for prudential regulation of relevant financial institutions, and a separate and distinct agency is responsible for business conduct and consumer protection. The primary advantage of this model is that it maximizes regulatory focus by concentrating responsibility for correcting a single form of market failure--one agency, one objective. This consolidation reduces regulatory gaps, turf wars among regulators, and the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage by financial institutions, while unlocking natural synergies among agencies. And perhaps more importantly, it reflects the financial markets' extraordinary integration and complexity. It does pose a key problem in that effective lines of communication between the peaks are vital to success.
    There are several ideas in circulation in the United States. I would like to focus on some things that we focused on in the Treasury Blueprint in 2008 and some other relevant policymakers that are talking about other ideas.
    The March 2008 Blueprint proposes that the United States consider an objectives-based regulatory framework, similar to what Dr. Carmichael discussed, with three objectives: Market stability regulation, prudential regulation to address issues of limited market discipline, and business conduct regulation. Prudential regulation housed within one regulatory body in the United States can focus on the common elements of risk management across financial institutions, which is sorely lacking in the United States. Regulators focused on specific objectives can be more effective at enforcing market discipline by targeting of financial institutions for which prudential regulation is most appropriate.
    Secretary of the Treasury Geithner and FDIC Chair Bair addressed similar issues of importance in dealing with too-big-to-fail institutions and the necessity of providing systemic risk regulation. Senator Collins, you introduced legislation that recognizes the key aspects that need to be addressed in our system to deal with these difficult problems.
    So while there is an emerging consensus in the United States and among global financial regulators, market participants, and policymakers that systemic risk regulation and resolution authority must be a cornerstone of reform financial regulation, the exact details of the proposals need to be settled. These are very complicated and they require thoughtful debate and deliberation.
    One point, however, is clear: The U.S. regulatory system, in its current form, needs to be modernized and evolved. We should seize upon this opportunity to do this. To this end, the future American regulatory framework must be directed towards its proper objectives to maintain a stable, well-capitalized, and responsible financial sector.
    Thank you for inviting me.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thanks, Mr. Nason. Very helpful.
    A vote just went off, but I think we are going to try to do a kind of tag team here, so Senator Collins will go over now, and I will ask questions, and then we will go on from there. The testimony has been very interesting.
    While your testimony is in my mind, Mr. Nason, just take a moment, and if we went to the twin peaks here--although as Dr. Carmichael said, there are actually four in Australia--what would be under the two peaks?
"
Mr. Nason," Well, I said the twin peaks model, but essentially we would be asking for three peaks.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Three, really.
"
Mr. Nason," Three peaks in the United States.
"
Chairman Lieberman," One being the Federal Reserve.
"
Mr. Nason," One would be market stability regulation, which we recommend in the Blueprint would be housed at the Federal Reserve.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Nason," One would be prudential regulation of institutions that require prudential regulation for your banks and your insurance companies. And then business conduct regulation, which is the type of consumer protection regulation that we historically see in the consumer aspects of the Federal Reserve and the banking agencies and most of what the Securities and Exchange Commission does.
"
Chairman Lieberman," So you would split up some of the existing regulatory agencies' functions, so it is not as simple as asking which agencies would go under which, because you would take pieces of each.
"
Mr. Nason," Yes, the model in the United States, it is a difficult way to think about it, but if you take the consumer elements of the banking agencies, put them under the business conduct regulator, take the bulk of the responsibilities of the SEC, put them under the business conduct regulator, and leave the prudential or financial regulation in a separate regulatory body, those are the two peaks. And then I think there is an important role that is not demonstrated in those two peaks: Someone taking the ownership of systemwide risks, and that is the important role that we give to the Federal Reserve in our Blueprint.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Incidentally, I like the Paulson plan's use of the words ``market stability regulator'' because I think it is more clear than systemic regulator, which always confuses me at least.
"
Mr. Nason," We spent an enormous amount of time debating that, and I am glad you noticed it. The one reason we called it ``market stability'' is to indicate to everyone that you are going to have bouts of instability, and the goal is to try to keep the markets as stable as possible. But you cannot prevent it.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right. Let me ask Mr. Green, Dr. Carmichael, and Dr. Clark, from outside the United States looking in--acknowledging that we have heard some mixed testimony here on the question I am about to ask--and based on your experience, obviously, what role do you think the fragmented nature of our current structure played in the extent of the current economic crisis here in the United States? Can you make a judgment on that, Mr. Green?
"
Mr. Green," I think the most striking example--and there are several--was the AIG affair, where, of course, there was no Federal jurisdiction, as you know, which meant that although there was a lead regulator in the New York State Insurance Commission, nevertheless, that jurisdiction was shared with a lot of other regulators. And the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) also had a role, and I think it is fairly clear and widely acknowledged that this meant there were gaps in terms of looking at the whole picture for a global firm.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Green," The other example I think relates to the U.S. investment banks, which almost uniquely at the global level were not regulated along with the rest of the banking system. And that led to gaps or inconsistencies. They were not--although they did business that was very similar----
"
Chairman Lieberman," To banks.
    Mr. Green [continuing]. To banks and, indeed, in the rest of the world was done in banks. Nevertheless, they had a quite different capital regime, and, indeed, curiously, their consolidated capital regime was voluntary. That, of course, came to an end very abruptly over a weekend. This was a risk that a lot of people knew was waiting to be crystallized. But those are two big examples, if you like.
"
Chairman Lieberman," So those are examples that suggest that structure had some kind of causal effect, or at least enabling effect on the crisis.
    Dr. Carmichael, what would you say? And they are good examples, I think.
"
Mr. Carmichael," I do not have a lot to add to that because I think it is spot on. If one had to put rough percentages on it--and this has got no science--I would say it was enabled 70 percent by the structure and 30 percent by bad regulation. So I think the structure actually had more to do with the problem.
    I will add one example to what Mr. Green said. I was interested in one regulatory response to AIG--regulated, of course, by the State regulator. The State regulator said, ``We now want to regulate credit default swaps as an insurance product,'' and immediately the impossibility of that became apparent in that, unless the other 49 States agreed to do it, the business would just move over the border. And this is not a national border. It is just moving across the Hudson River, for example.
    So the insurance regulatory structure enables arbitrage, enables gravitation to the lowest common denominator. Like Mr. Green, we were amazed when we found that AIG was regulated by OTS as a conglomerate. That just seems ludicrous. So I agree entirely.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thanks. Dr. Clark.
"
Mr. Clark," I guess what I would say I would not get yourself trapped that if you cannot take a direct link back to the great financial crisis, you should not clean it up. And so I would say the U.S. system obviously has a lot of issues that, even if they did not create the great financial crisis, certainly do not make the system run any better. And so I think whether you have 100 regulators or 50 does not matter. There is clearly regulatory shopping that goes on constantly in the United States, and that cannot be a good thing to have a sound system.
"
Chairman Lieberman," That is a very important point. We are focused on this now because of the current crisis, and there are some clear linkages, as Mr. Green and Dr. Carmichael said. But there are obviously other reasons beyond that to want to alter our structure, and that is one of them--regulatory shopping.
    What else? You made a reference in your gracious and diplomatic use of the term ``diversified.'' I presume that underneath that was some sense that it was really pretty hard to work together with the United States because of the way in which the regulatory system was so dispersed?
"
Mr. Green," Certainly for regulators in the rest of the world--and Mr. Carmichael will have a view on this as well. Leave aside this AIG problem, even in the banking field there was no single voice in the United States. Although a case can be made for regulatory competition in this kind of area, it is not very clear where the advantages came from regulatory competition, and certainly in international discussions, it is very difficult to have a completely coherent discussion when there are three or four counterparties in some discussions even about capital. And the SEC, if it was not there, should have been there.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Green," It makes it very difficult to come to international consensus.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Yes, and obviously we are in--to say the obvious--a global economy, and there are times when we want to have interactions globally that are not facilitated by the way in which we are organized. So I take your point.
    I am going to have to go in a minute, but, Mr. Nason, from the U.S. perspective, are there any negative effects for American business in a global economy that result--or even domestically, but particularly globally--from this fractured system we have now?
"
Mr. Nason," Sure. The clearest and easiest example--sorry to beat it to death--is insurance. There are two things that are clear. One, the international community does not understand and appreciate the State regulatory system for insurance, so that American industry is not well represented around the globe. And, second, in periods of crisis like this, we learned all too well at the Treasury that we would be benefited significantly by having a Federal expert in insurance that you can draw upon for expertise.
    One of the big problems associated with dealing with the AIG failure is there is no Federal person responsible for that industry, so you cannot draw on Federal expertise. And that was a very significant consequence of having this fractured system.
    Another example we mentioned is the Office of Thrift Supervision, which has oversight responsibilities for the holding companies of a lot of these institutions, but does not have the appropriate stature to represent the thrifts around the world. So it is an inequality that hurts the institutions that have thrifts in this structure.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you.
    I am going to ask that we stand in recess. As soon as Senator Collins comes back, I will ask the staff to please encourage her to begin her questioning.
    The hearing is recessed.
    [Recess.]
    Senator Collins [presiding]. The hearing will come back to order. Senator Lieberman has graciously allowed me to temporarily assume the role of Chairman and reconvene the hearing so that we can keep proceeding through this vote.
    I want to thank each of you for your very interesting testimony and bring up several issues in the hopes that I am not repeating too much of what the Chairman may have already asked you.
    Mr. Carmichael, you talked about the four peaks, as you described it, and that some of the advantages were that each focuses on one aspect. You avoid conflict. You have essentially a functional regulatory approach. And then you said there is also a council of regulators. Does that council of regulators have responsibility for identifying systemic risk?
"
Mr. Carmichael," In a short answer, yes. But, more importantly, their role is to communicate and coordinate between the agencies and to make sure that there is a regular testing of issues. Sometimes the central bank, if it is concerned about a systemic issue, has the power to send some of its staff with the prudential people going on inspections, for example, to learn more about what some of those issues might be. The involvement of the Treasury is there for exactly the systemic type reason.
    So while it does not have any direct authority--there is no charter that gives it the power to do anything--through coordination they are able to focus the issues and decide, for example, do we need more information about a particular area? Do we need one of the agencies to collect that on behalf of the systemic regulator?
    Senator Collins. Mr. Nason, I know you were very involved in the Paulson Blueprint for reform, and I very much appreciated your insights. As I understand it, the Blueprint that Secretary Paulson put out did call for a systemic risk regulator, but it would be vested in, I believe, the Federal Reserve. Is that correct?
"
Mr. Nason," Yes.
    Senator Collins. When you were involved in drafting the Blueprint, was consideration given to the council approach?
"
Mr. Nason," It was not labeled the ``council approach,'' but one thing we did consider was providing more authority to the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which is very similar to the council approach. We thought about it very seriously because there is a lot of elements of attractiveness to having a council because you are bringing a lot of different sets of expertise to bear.
    One of the things we got tripped up on is providing the right amount of authority, and we were worried about clarity of purpose and clarity of mission among a council. But it is certainly something that we considered seriously.
    Senator Collins. Mr. Clark, is there a system for identifying systemic risk in Canada?
"
Mr. Clark," The system, I think, would be very similar, as I understand from Dr. Carmichael, to the Australian system. There is a group that meets regularly that is chaired by the Deputy Minister of Finance and would have our regulator, OSFI, on it and would have the Bank of Canada on it and the Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC), the equivalent to the FDIC, on it. And, in fact, they have now created two committees--one which is called the Financial Institutions Supervisory Committee (FISC), which is designed more to deal with low-level coordination issues, and then a second one that deals with more explicitly strategic issues. And I think it is probably fair to say that as a result of this crisis, the role of that committee in making sure that they are debating what the systemic risk is and who is doing what about it has been elevated as a result of this.
    Senator Collins. Mr. Green, what about in Great Britain? How is systemic risk handled?
"
Mr. Green," There is a so-called tripartite committee which brings together the Bank of England--the central bank--the FSA, and the Treasury, which was intended to look at the functioning of the system as a whole. And the Bank of England had a mandate in relation to the stability of the system as a whole.
    I think there was insufficient clarity about just what that meant in the original drafting and what that meant in terms of the role of the Bank of England--which, in fact, leaves a bit of a question in my mind in relation to the so-called Paulson Blueprint. The central bank has, as the monetary authority, the capacity to lend and to change monetary policy. But then there is an issue about what other tools does it have? Does it have the capacity then to instruct the regulators to take action on grounds of systemic risk?
    I think, in fact, in the United Kingdom, the Bank of England did not think that it had that authority. And the way the system worked, the lack of clarity of objectives in retrospect proved a bit of a disadvantage. And the Bank of England spent its time talking about the economy, and the FSA spent its time thinking about the individual firms. And one of the main lessons that has been learnt from the crisis is that the regulator needs to think more about what is happening in the wider economy, and the central bank needs to remember that monetary policy only has effect through the financial system.
    So it is quite a subtle set of links that is difficult to get precisely right.
    Senator Collins. I think those are excellent points.
    Mr. Nason, obviously one of the failures of our system was a failure to identify high-risk products that escaped regulation and yet ended up having a cascade of consequences for the entire financial system. And I am thinking in particular of credit default swaps, which in my mind were an insurance product, but they were not regulated as an insurance product. They were not regulated as a securities product. They really were not regulated by anyone.
    And as long as we have bright financial people, which we always will, we are going to have innovation and the creation of new derivatives, new products.
    One of my goals is to try to prevent these what I call ``regulatory black holes'' from occurring where a high-risk practice or product can emerge and no one regulator in our system has clear authority over it. Without a council, there is nobody to identify it and figure out who should be regulating it.
    What are your thoughts on preventing these regulatory gaps?
"
Mr. Nason," I think there is a lot to like about what you are trying to achieve in your legislative proposal. I think that identifying the fact that credit default swap (CDS) and over-the-counter (OTC) derivative contracts are a source or a potential source of systemic risk is very important, and I am really happy to see you have identified it here and the Administration is thinking about ideas like putting them on exchanges and things like that, because OTC derivatives were typically not regulated because they were viewed as bilateral contracts between sophisticated parties. But they grew so big and they are so significant in the U.S. system that they proved to be two things: One, a source of great opaqueness in financial institutions where you could not get a sense of how important the derivative book was to a particular institution; and, two, a real channel for the too-interconnected-to-fail problem.
    So I think that you are certainly right to identify them as something that needs to be looked at carefully. I think that they are certainly something that should be under the supervision, oversight, and jurisdiction of a council or a systemic risk regulator. And I think that I am happy that things are moving along in that way.
    Senator Collins. Mr. Clark, I admire your foresight in deciding that some of these derivative products were simply not well understood and were too high risk in getting out of that market. In Canada, however, was there regulation of credit default swaps and those kinds of exotic derivatives? Or did the regulation only come about through safety and soundness regulations? If you understand what I am saying.
"
Mr. Clark," I think so. In a sense, it was safety and soundness, and I think it is fair to say as we were exiting the business, Canadian banks were going into the business. So it was not as if our regulator was saying do not do this.
    Senator Collins. That is what I was wondering.
"
Mr. Clark," And as I pointed out earlier, Canadian banks collectively took $18 billion (CAD) in writedowns. So in U.S. terms, that is $180 billion, given the size of the country, so it is not an insignificant amount. So we cannot stand here and say there are no problems in Canada. I think that would be a misnomer.
    I think this is a very difficult area because I think the reality is that people were aware of this and they were aware that the products were getting bigger and more complex. But as we were talking during the break, the reality is that people were making a lot of money on it, and it looked like it was very profitable. And I would say in its initial evolution, credit derivatives were actually a positive factor, and so for us as a bank, we were able to lay off a significant amount of our risk by buying credit protection, and in that sense we saw it as a good thing, not a bad thing. And it is only as a later evolution that in a sense it ended up causing, I think, some of the problems.
    I think it underscores the capability issue, the one we talked earlier about AIG, that in this war, if you will, or race for knowledge, you have a very profitable and highly sophisticated industry in the banking system around the world. I think it does mean that you cannot afford to have three or four regulators trying to go up the scale of knowledge. You do have to have a concentrated knowledge in order to attract the people to try to have a counter-push to these ideas.
    Senator Collins. Mr. Carmichael, any thoughts on how to prevent regulatory black holes as new products emerge?
"
Mr. Carmichael," Two things I would add to the comments made so far. First of all, having banking and insurance under the one regulator, as is the case in Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom, gives your regulator a much better chance to pick up where those risks are being laid off. And you look at the United States where you have 50 State insurance regulators, picking that up as a problem for AIG was much more difficult than it would have been under the other architectures.
    The other side of it that I would add is that in a structure where you have a clear conduct regulator and that regulator has a responsibility for markets, that is where the primary responsibility for new markets, which is where new products tend to spring up. Regardless of how the market is conducted, whether bilateral or on an organized exchange, conduct should be the responsibility of that particular regulator, provided they have the mandate and the skills to pick that up and do with it what they need to. That is where you would get the primary regulation, the disclosures, the aggregation of information, and so on for those markets.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Senator McCaskill.
             OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MCCASKILL
    Senator McCaskill. Thank you.
    I do not know if you can help, Mr. Nason, but I have had a hard time figuring out how we missed all this. And you were at the Treasury Department for the 3 years prior to when we came this close to a global meltdown as it relates to our credit markets. And, I guess I am curious as to why you think no one at Treasury--I mean, I was in a room with Secretary Paulson, and I do not want to say that they were panicked, but there is a reason why there was such bipartisan support 40 days before our political election. If there was ever a time in this building that the two sides cannot get along, it would be 40 days before our national presidential elections. And when you had both major candidates for President voting in favor from both ends of the political spectrum, that was because we all had been given very detailed and accurate information about how close we were to completely falling off the table as it related to our credit markets.
    I cannot get comfortable with how we are going to identify risk going forward if the best and the brightest in our country, supposedly the best financial minds in the world, did not see this coming. Can you help me?
"
Mr. Nason," I can try to help you. I do not have the answers, and we will be debating this for decades as to what actually happened. But I think there were a couple things that happened.
    People saw individual things that they were worried about. The regulators knew that underwriting criteria had gone down for home mortgages. People had seen there was a very frothy housing market. People had seen that the covenants in debt were going down to a level that they were concerned with.
    But I think what really was very surprising and what caught people off guard was the severity with which things went from being very frothy--people were not paying adequate attention to risk, so the pendulum was nobody cared about risk at all, people were just worried about making money--to people who were not willing to take risk at all. So there was just a complete and utter contraction of credit in the economy that caused an enormous contraction.
    The speed with which that happened was something that people were not expecting. You got to a point where money center banks would not lend to each other for 20 days or for 10 days without paying exorbitant interest rates. So you had a complete breakdown in confidence. And I cannot give you comfort that we are going to find it again. I can give you comfort that this is that 1-in-100-year event. And you can try to manage it better, you can try to prepare yourself better, but this is one of those things where I do not think you can predict it. You can just put yourself in a better position to try to deal with it.
    Senator McCaskill. Which of the three parts of your plan would be responsible for identifying what happened?
"
Mr. Nason," Well, the three parts of the plan--first of all, the plan was not created to deal with the financial crisis. It was actually written before the financial crisis happened.
    Senator McCaskill. You wrote it in March, right?
"
Mr. Nason," Well, we researched and wrote it the year going up to March, and we released it right after Bear Stearns failed, but it was not in response to those types of events.
    Senator McCaskill. Right.
"
Mr. Nason," So the plan is not a lookback plan. But I think generally speaking, you would have coordination among the three parties to describe how to better position ourselves to deal with this better.
    Senator McCaskill. Let us assume that instead of your plan being announced in March 2008--obviously, this is a fantasy--that Congress passed it whole cloth and it was in existence. Which is the body that you would expect under the plan that has been drawn up would be the one to say things are nuts, people are overleveraging, they have no idea what they are buying and selling, they are chasing a number, and it is all about greed?
"
Mr. Nason," Sure. I would tell you that each of the three would have a role, and here is what they would do. On the prudential side, there would be tightened standards for capital for financial institutions and more regulation on liquidity management. On the conduct side, there would be stronger regulations for mortgages and things like that. And on the market stability side, there would be more focus on the interconnectedness of these two institutions and also of things like the derivatives markets. Those would be three ways that each of the three pillars of the Paulson plan would respond to this.
    Senator McCaskill. Is it possible that the three pillars of the Paulson plan, that each one of those pillars would have said it was their job?
"
Mr. Nason," No. That is actually one of the premises of the Paulson plan, is clarity of mission and clarity of objective. See, one of the problems that we dealt with was that there was a lot of finger pointing. There were battles between the State regulators versus the Federal regulators on who was in charge of mortgage origination. So there were concerns about who was in charge of the holding company of Lehman Brothers. Was it the OTS or the SEC?
    So there is much less chance for finger pointing under an objectives-based criteria like the Dutch and the Australians have.
    Senator McCaskill. Mr. Clark, I heard you say that you originate mortgages to hold them, and I keep explaining that one of my concerns about reverse mortgages that we are now ramping up in this country is that they are very similar to subprimes in that the people who are closing loans have no skin in the game. Now, the scary thing about reverse mortgages is that all of the skin is taxpayer skin. If those assets are sold at term and they are not sufficient to cover the loan, the Federal Government has to cover the loan. But in the subprime, it was all of these exotic sliced and diced derivatives that were spread out all over that we are trying, like Humpty-Dumpty, to put back together again now.
    I assume that in Canada the people who are holding the mortgage are the same ones who made them and, therefore, they continue to have skin in the game.
"
Mr. Clark," Absolutely. We originate all the mortgages. We do not buy mortgages. We originate our own mortgages. And, therefore, we are very concerned about the underwriting standards because we are going to take the risks.
    I do believe that the system of holding the mortgages does a couple of things for you. One, it means you have the banking system trying to make sure you have conservative risk, not wild risk. But, second, it actually gives us an asset. The way I always describe our bank is we are not an income statement that generates a balance sheet. We are a balance sheet that generates an income statement. And that means we have a solidity of earnings that is there because we are not originating mortgages, then selling them off, and then saying, well, where am I getting next year's income if we originate more and sell them off. We are actually holding them.
    And so I think it produces tremendous stability in the system, but it does require a regulatory regime that does not penalize you for capital if, in fact, you hold a low-risk asset like that.
    Senator McCaskill. Do you think we should have regulations that require people who close mortgages to assume some of the risk?
"
Mr. Clark," I think some system where the people who originate have skin in the game is quite important.
    Senator McCaskill. Mr. Nason, what do you think?
"
Mr. Nason," I think that what we have seen is that our securitization markets certainly got overheated, and there is certainly some merit----
    Senator McCaskill. I think a bonfire is more like it.
"
Mr. Nason," I am not going to quibble with that. I think a bonfire is just fine. I do want to suggest, though, that the securitization market, it is a bad word right now and it is an ugly word, but it has a lot of value. It provides a lot of credit to the economy. A lot of markets depend on it. It is important to rebuild that market so we can get more credit in the economy. Today, the auto industry relies on it; a lot of industries rely on it. So it is important. Whether or not it overheated like a bonfire, I think that is a fair characterization.
    Senator McCaskill. Would you mind if I ask one more question?
    Chairman Lieberman [presiding]. Go right ahead, Senator.
    Senator McCaskill. I am a little uneasy about BlackRock. I know that BlackRock was called in to manage at the New York Federal Reserve in terms of some of the valuation of the assets, and I know that there is some valuation of assets and then there is going around to the other window and participating--and I keep hearing that BlackRock is the only game in town, and that is why they are getting all these contracts. Their name came up again yesterday in connection with the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (PBGC), the guaranty fund for pensions in this country. I keep hearing that BlackRock is the only company that has the model and it is proprietary, and therefore, they are the only game in town, and we keep going back to BlackRock. In fact, I had somebody tell me that the Secretary of the Treasury talked more often to the head of BlackRock than probably a lot of other folks. And I do not know if that is true or not, but it worries me because of the--too big to fail aspect. Can I get you, without threat of torture, to give me your take on why BlackRock is all of a sudden everywhere and is involved in everything as it relates to sorting out our financial mess?
"
Mr. Nason," A couple of things. I cannot imagine that the comment that either Secretary of the Treasury spent more time talking to BlackRock than anyone else is accurate.
    Senator McCaskill. Hyperbole.
"
Mr. Nason," Hyperbole. That is one thing.
    The second thing is the determination of hiring BlackRock to manage the assets in the Maiden Lane/Bear Stearns situation, I think that was a decision made by the Federal Reserve, so that is not something I can speak about.
    I think generally speaking what you are dealing with is a large risk transfer of assets from financial institutions to a variety of structures. And what the government is trying to do is to protect the U.S. taxpayers' interest, hire someone who has some experience in managing those particular assets. BlackRock, Western Asset Management Company (WAMCO), and the Pacific Investment Management Company (PIMCO)--there are a couple of people who are very experienced in that.
    I do not know the specifics of that particular situation, but the only thing I can say is that there is a lot of oversight and regulation for this process. There are the procurement rules. There is the GAO and the TARP Inspector General that are making sure that policies and procedures are followed. So I think you can take comfort in the process surrounding how these asset managers are retained and the solicitations being made for them. That should give you comfort. I think there is a lot of transparency in that as well.
    Senator McCaskill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thank you, Senator McCaskill. Thanks for participating this afternoon.
    We will do a second round insofar as Members want to be here or can be here.
    The Paulson plan, the Treasury Department's plan, issued last March, as you probably know, envisioned a regulatory system similar to Australia's, which was objectives based. The report was controversial here, although, unfortunately, it got overwhelmed by the growing crisis, so it did not receive the discussion I think it deserved. But it called for consolidation and dissolution of some existing agencies.
    One controversial reform, which we have referred to briefly here this morning, was the consolidation of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).
    I wanted to ask our three witnesses from outside the United States--I think I know the answer, but not totally--if any of the three countries divide the regulation of securities and futures the way we do here in the United States, or are they regulated under one roof? Mr. Green, everything is under one roof?
"
Mr. Green," Everyone is under one roof and, indeed, it was, I think, always under one roof before the great merger into the FSA.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Green," There was no real distinction between the primary markets and the derivative markets. And I must say--and I stand to be corrected by my colleagues here--I am not aware of any other country where there is such a distinction.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Interesting. Correct, as far as you know, Mr. Carmichael?
"
Mr. Carmichael," Yes, certainly in Australia, it has always been under the one roof. What changed after we restructured was that we also had brought it into one law. Prior to that, there had been a separate law for derivatives and for securities, and there were two separate exchanges. Once the law was merged, the two exchanges also merged, and it was just simply a recognition that there is no fundamental distinction there at all.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right. How about Canada?
"
Mr. Clark," Well, unfortunately, we are the worst of all. We have multiple security regulators in Canada.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Worse than the United States.
"
Mr. Clark," Worse than the United States in this----
"
Chairman Lieberman," That is very interesting.
    Mr. Clark [continuing]. One respect, I would have to say. So I think we are trying to get a national regulator.
"
Chairman Lieberman," So is it----
"
Mr. Clark," State level, essentially, and so this has been an industry for 40 years to try to get this problem solved. I think the current government is working very hard to see whether they can get this reformed and have a national regulator. But it has faced enormous political disagreement on it because of state rights, essentially. And so I would say that is, if we were looking for black holes in Canada, the fact that we do not have a national regulator. And if you take a look at the one major crisis Canada did have around asset-backed paper, certainly a contributing factor was that there was no federal regulation of this. This was all done at the provincial level and so escaped--so it was--I think it represents a black hole example.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Mr. Nason, I take it that historically the reason we had both the SEC and the CFTC is that the CFTC grew up from the trading in agricultural commodities and they did not want to be mixed with the Wall Street regulators.
"
Mr. Nason," Historically, that is the genesis of the CFTC's creation in the 1970s. But, interestingly enough, when the CFTC was being created, Members of Congress and their staffs asked the SEC if they wanted the jurisdiction for agricultural commodities, and they declined because it was a specialized market.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Nason," But now I think the volume of financial futures on the futures exchanges is well over 90 percent; whereas, in the 1970s it was significantly bifurcated between financial and agriculture.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Yes. I think this has a lot of logic, but it is going to be, for those historical reasons, difficult here. And we can already see not just the regulated entities but the Members of Congress fighting for the status quo; that is, the Agriculture Committee fighting to keep a separate CFTC. Of course, Senator Collins and I think that is why this Committee has a unique role to play, because we have no vested interest on either side--at least not in this matter. We may in other matters.
    Let me go on to ask Mr. Green, Dr. Carmichael, and Mr. Clark about what I would call transition challenges. As we are heading toward a time of reform, both regulatory and structural, I wonder if you could give us any counsel about transition problems that your countries faced, particularly the two of you, during the transition to a more consolidated regulatory system and any warnings you would give us as a result.
"
Mr. Green," We had a Big Bang in the United Kingdom under very unusual circumstances. It was not prepared by a great deal of discussion, but it was accepted almost without subsequent debate because so many parties thought that it solved a lot of prior problems. So there was, if you like, a consensus that the previous arrangements were unsatisfactory, and there were a lot of attractions in what was being done then.
    There was a big advantage, though, in that because there was almost no warning, and the government was able to decide, using its parliamentary majority, that this would happen. The people just had to get on with it, and the organizations were thrown together and told they had to come up with a solution. There was not any alternative. You are not in that position in the United States.
    I suppose the lesson that one would draw from it is that if it is at all possible to start with a structure that, rather as I said in my earlier remarks, does not have one organization clearly in the lead, but you are building a true merger and a new structure out of that, there may be a greater chance of success. But the historical circumstances were quite unusual in that respect.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Dr. Carmichael, in addition to responding to that, I wonder if you would talk just a little bit about what the opinion is in Australia now about whether this was a good move to go to the so-called twin peaks, in the government, amongst the public, and I suppose in the regulated community.
"
Mr. Carmichael," Anytime you have change, you are going to have some difficulty, and I have been through this not only twice in Australia with regulatory amalgamation, but in about half a dozen countries where I have worked as well. So I have seen some of the problems that can arise firsthand.
    Two of the biggest ones are fear--and that is mainly among staff--fear for jobs, and fear for where they will end up in the new structure.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Right.
"
Mr. Carmichael," And the second is distraction. Regulators have a job to do, a day job, which is regulation, but they are distracted because of the reorganization and the rebuilding. So those are two very big considerations that you have to deal with in any change.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Did previous agencies disappear, as I take it they did, in the United Kingdom?
"
Mr. Carmichael," Some did.
"
Chairman Lieberman," But some continued.
"
Mr. Carmichael," Yes.
"
Chairman Lieberman," They were just put into one of the peaks.
"
Mr. Carmichael," We plucked parts of the central bank and parts of some of the State regulators and put them together into a national regulator. We only had one major institutional rebuild. The others were sort of tinkered with at the edges. If reform happened here it would be a much more extensive rebuilding than that because of the sheer number of agencies that you have.
    But there are two things that in my experience have been absolutely critical to getting to the end without falling over. First is leadership--we have found that if you identify the people who are going to be the leaders of the new organizations, you have to do that early and you have to put them in place to drive the changes because there are always people who will resist the change and undermine the process. You do not want them anywhere around when you are doing it. So there is a need to make the big decisions early on and then to get on with it.
    The second one is communication--so that people understand what is happening, and they get involved with it. The more you can involve staff in the new structure, the more they will feel ownership for it and be a part of it.
    I should mention two other things. Mr. Green mentioned Big Bang. In the United Kingdom, they did a Big Bang in terms of making the decision very quickly. In terms of moving to a new internal structure, the FSA moved in gradual steps over quite a long period of time. We used a very different approach. We just kept the agencies separate for a year. We brought them together in name but people kept doing their old jobs for that year. We redesigned how we wanted the agency to look at the end of that. And at the end of the first year, we basically sacked everyone and invited them to apply for new jobs in the new agency. And for 2 weeks I did not sleep, not knowing whether we would actually have an agency at the end of the process. I would not recommend that approach. It worked, but I would not recommend it for anyone else.
    The last point I would make before getting to your comment about whether it was a success is about legal elements, and I speak here as a non-lawyer, but I have learned to respect law much more over the last 10 or 15 years than I ever did. It was a mistake in Australia to create the agency just with a piece of enabling legislation that set it up, said what its powers were, but left it to operate under each of the individual industry acts that were already in place. So we still had a banking act and a general insurance act and so on.
    What we have done in a couple of other countries is take each of those pieces of legislation and, before creating the agency, take all of the regulatory powers out of those and move them up into the agency's act. The power of that is just incredible.
    For example, when we first wanted to create a new governance standard for all of our industries, my lawyers said, ``I am sorry, Chairman. You cannot do that. You have to issue it under each of the different pieces of legislation, and some of them do not even give you the power to do that.''
    So the ability to create a harmonized approach in Australia was severely handicapped by the law.
    Now, the United Kingdom went about it another way--they created an omnibus act. It was very painful, but the outcome was very strong.
    So legal elements are important. I would encourage you, if you go this route, to get the legislation running ahead of the agency, if you can. Get the legal side sorted out so that the agency has the powers to do what it needs to do.
    You asked whether it was a good move. The answer is undoubtedly, yes. Our Prime Minister in Australia and our Treasurer are out around the world crowing about how great our system has been. If you wound the clock back 2 years ago, they were still grumbling that the system belonged to their predecessors, who were of a different party. The story has changed enormously.
"
Chairman Lieberman," That is powerful testimony. Thank you. Senator Collins.
    Senator Collins. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Carmichael, let me take up where the Chairman left off. Your four peaks or twin peaks approach has a lot of appeal to me, but I am wondering, as someone who spent 5 years overseeing financial regulation in the State of Maine, how it works for the regulatory community. If you have separate regulators, do you also have separate compliance audits? In other words, in Maine, when we would send out our bank auditors to review the State-chartered banks for compliance, they did the entire audit because it was only that one agency plus there was a Federal agency involved as well. But if you have separate regulators for prudential regulation competition, are you having multiple audits?
"
Mr. Carmichael," The answer is yes, but ``multiple'' is a very small number in that our prudential regulator has the primary responsibility for on-site inspections. And I should say we are much more of a principles-based than a rules-based country, so we do not do anything like as many audits and on-site inspections as would be common under the U.S. approach.
    Our conduct regulator, which is the pillar that looks at mis-selling and mis-pricing of products, works on the basis of responding to complaints. So they are not out there auditing complaints as such. They will hear a complaint, and they are really looking for misconduct of a type. Then they will do an investigation. So it is very targeted. It is not a regular on-site audit of that style.
    So in the sense of overlap, it is really quite minimal.
    Senator Collins. I also recall when I was head of the Financial Department that we would have regulated entities say, well, we are going to consider becoming federally chartered unless you do X. So there is a real problem in our country with shopping for the easiest regulator and playing the States off against the Federal regulators and vice versa. And because that is an income stream to the regulator, those threats matter to State governments, particularly State governments that are strapped for funds. So I think that is an issue as well.
    Mr. Nason, in the United States we now recognize that a large shadow banking sector can threaten the entire financial sector, and I, for one, believe that it is not enough to monitor just the safety and soundness of traditional banks, but we need to extend safety and soundness regulation to investment banks, for example, to subsidiaries of companies like AIG.
    Bear Stearns, I am told, had an astonishing leverage ratio of 30:1 when it failed. Do you think that we should be extending some system of capital requirements across the financial sector?
"
Mr. Nason," That is a great and very difficult question. If you go back to Bear Stearns, Bear Stearns was under a consolidated supervisory system that was administered by the SEC, so they did have liquidity and capital requirements that were different than the banking system, but they were under some type of conglomerate supervision.
    I think generally if you are a systemically important institution, it is hard to argue that you should not be under some type of systemic supervision to prevent hurting the general economy.
    What gets harder is where do you draw the line between which types of institutions gets safety and soundness supervision and which do not? For example, a very easy case is some hedge funds, you can make an argument that they are systemically important because of their size or concentration in particular markets. They could probably be subjected to some type of supervision. Should all hedge funds be subjected to that type of supervision? The case is harder the smaller they become.
    So the way that we cut it in the Blueprint is that institutions would all need to be licensed, chartered, and under the supervision of our systemic regulator. But that type of systemic regulation was different than traditional prudential safety and soundness regulation.
    Senator Collins. It, of course, gets very complicated very quickly because if you designate certain financial institutions as systemically important and, thus, make them subject to safety and soundness regulation, you are also sending a message that they are too big to fail--a very bad message to send because then you are creating moral hazard.
    This is so complicated to figure out the right answer here, but I do think it is significant that the Canadian banks, with their higher capital requirements and the ability to hold lower-return assets, lower-risk assets, and lower leverage ratios compared to American banks, were healthier. They did not fail. So, clearly, there has got to be a lesson for us there.
    Mr. Clark, I know we are running out of time, but I do want to talk to you further about the lending practices. I completely agree with my colleague from Missouri that part of the problem with the American mortgage system was that risk and responsibility were divorced, so you had a mortgage broker who was making the loan, gets his or her cut, then sells it to the bank, which gets its cut, which then sells it to the secondary market. Everyone is getting a financial reward, but ultimately no one is responsible for the mortgage if it goes bad. There is no skin in the game, which I think is a big problem, although difficult to solve because of the liquidity issues that Mr. Nason raised.
    But there are other key differences as well that you talked to me about when we were in my office, and they had to do with downpayment levels, mortgage insurance, and deductibility of interest. Could you discuss some of the differences between Canadian and American mortgage lending?
"
Mr. Clark," Maybe I should just mention one other feature that I have not underscored but we found a tremendous difference on the two sides of the border. In Canada, because we hold all the mortgages, modifying the mortgages is easy to do. We do not have to ask anyone's permission to modify the mortgage. And it is not the government coming to us and saying, ``Would you start? Here is our modification program.'' We just were instantly modifying the mortgages.
    Last year, we represented about 20 percent of the mortgage market in Canada. We only foreclosed on 1,000 homes in a whole year, to give you an order of magnitude. And every one of those thousand we regarded as a failure. And so the last thing we would ever want to do is actually foreclose on a good customer. And so we go out of our way to modify the mortgages, and that is just natural practice for us because I do not have to ask permission of some investor whether or not I want to do this or can do it or what rules are governing it.
    So I do think that has turned out in this crisis to be a second feature that, frankly, none of us would have thought about until the current crisis.
    In terms of our specifics, we are required, if we, in fact, lend more than 80 percent loan-to-value, to actually insure the mortgage so that represents a constraint. It would not have represented a constraint to the kind of no documentation lending that was done in the United States because the actual underwriting we are doing. But then again, because we actually would be holding the mortgages, we insisted on full documentation.
    There is not interest deductibility. I think there is no question that the feature of having interest deductibility in the United States is a major factor for leveraging up. And despite the fact that it is justified on the basis that it encourages homeownership, historically homeownership has actually been higher in Canada than it has been in the United States. So there is no evidence that the two are linked at all. All it does is inflate housing prices because, in fact, people look at the after-tax cost in computing the value on which they are to bid for the houses.
    So I would say those are the main features. We do have mortgage brokers, but they are originating mortgages which we then hold. We do not sell them on. And I think that is the core feature.
    Senator Collins. And just to clarify, in most cases the homebuyer is putting down 20 percent. Is that correct?
"
Mr. Clark," Yes. Although when I started my first house, I bought the insurance and put down less than 20 percent. But you can do it. But, again, we would not lend to that person unless we were sure they were going to pay us back because we are responsible for the collections, we are responsible for managing that, and it is really our customer relationship, which is how we regard it.
    Senator Collins. I think it is fascinating that homeownership levels are actually higher in Canada than in the United States, because the justification for all these policies that encouraged the subprime mortgage market was to increase homeownership. And, in fact, it has caused a lot of people to lose homes that they could not afford in the first place, and the Canadian experience is very instructive.
    Mr. Green, last question to you. In the United Kingdom, what are the lending policies? Are they more similar to the Canadian practices or to the American practices?
"
Mr. Green," A mixture. There is also no interest deductibility in the United Kingdom, though that has not stopped a boom in house prices. There has been no regulation of the terms of lending, and one of the issues that has arisen in the review that the FSA has undertaken of what went wrong and what might need to change--which I commend to you, it is a very detailed review covering many of the issues we have talked about today--is whether there should be some kind of mandatory loan-to-value ratios or loan-to-income ratios. So they were not in place, but that is seriously being considered.
    What has now been agreed at the European level is that there will be skin in the game and that the originator in securitization will have to maintain 5 percent. And I think I am right in saying that has now been legislated across the European Union because of a rather widespread perception that this was a problem that needed fixing. You may say 5 percent is only symbolic, but, of course, it will concentrate the minds of the management to all the issues that Dr. Clark has mentioned.
    Senator Collins. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Lieberman," Thanks very much, Senator Collins.
    Thanks to our four witnesses. Thanks for the trouble you took to come here, for the time you spent with us, and, most of all, for sharing your experiences and opinions. I found this to be a very helpful hearing. Even you, Mr. Nason, who did not come that far. [Laughter.]
    We appreciate your testimony. And at the risk of simplifying it, I think in various ways your testimony has shown us that structure matters, obviously regulation does, too, that you need a healthy combination of both, and that none is a cure-all. You cannot assume that a good regulatory structure will solve all the problems. But it will solve some of them, and it will prevent others from occurring or make it harder for others to occur. I think you have helped clarify opinions up here, so we thank you very much.
    It is our normal course to keep the record of the hearing open for 15 days for any additional questions or statements. If you have any second thoughts you want to add to the printed record--all your prepared statements, which were excellent, will be printed in the record in full. It may be that some Members of the Committee, those who were here and those who were not, would file some questions with you, and if you have the chance, it would be appreciated if you would answer them for the record. But, really, our thanks, and I hope you will both watch with interest as we proceed to attempt to reform and say a prayer for us as well.
    The hearing is adjourned. Thank you.
