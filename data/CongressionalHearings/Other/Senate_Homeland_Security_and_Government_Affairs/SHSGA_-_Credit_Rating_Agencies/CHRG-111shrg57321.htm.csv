"Senator Levin","Good morning, everybody. Today's hearing is the third in a series of Subcommittee hearings focusing on some of the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis, a man-made economic assault on our country that is still foreclosing on homes, shuttering businesses, and driving unemployment. We saw the beginning of the assault in our first two hearings, which examined how U.S. financial institutions turned to high-risk lending strategies to earn quick profits, dumping hundreds of billions of dollars in toxic mortgages into the financial system, like polluters dumping poison upstream in a river. At the second hearing, we showed how regulators saw what was going on, understood the risk, but sat on their hands or fought each other rather than stand up to the banks which were profiting from the pollution. Those toxic mortgages were scooped up by Wall Street firms that bottled them in complex financial instruments and turned to the credit rating agencies to get a label declaring them to be safe, low-risk, investment-grade securities. Today, we are focusing on the role played by the credit rating agencies. Next week, we will look at the last stage of the economic assault, when Wall Street investment bankers magnified and spread the risk posed by toxic mortgages through the use of complex structured finance transactions. For a hundred years, Main Street investors trusted U.S. credit rating agencies to guide them toward safe investments. Even sophisticated investors, like pension funds, municipalities, insurance companies, and university endowments, have relied on credit ratings to protect them from Wall Street excesses and distinguish between safe and risky investments. But now that trust has been broken. We have used as case histories the two biggest credit rating agencies in the United States, Moody's and Standard & Poor's, and the ratings they gave to the key financial instruments that fueled the financial crisis--residential mortgage backed securities (RMBSs), and collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). The Subcommittee investigation found that those credit rating agencies allowed Wall Street to impact their analysis, their independence, and their reputation for reliability. And they did it for the money. This chart, Exhibit 1g,\1\ shows that from 2002 to 2007, the three top credit rating agencies doubled their revenues, from less than $3 billion to over $6 billion per year. Most of this increase came from rating complex financial instruments. According to Standard & Poor's, between 2000 and 2006, investment banks underwrote nearly $2 trillion in mortgage- backed securities, $435 billion or 36 percent of which were backed by subprime mortgages. All of those securities needed ratings. Moody's and S&P each rated about 10,000 RMBS securities over the course of 2006 and 2007. Credit rating executives got paid Wall Street-sized salaries. \1\ See Exhibit No. 1g, which appears in the Appendix on page 242. At the same time, the credit rating agencies were operating with an inherent conflict of interest, because the revenues they pocketed came from the companies whose securities they rated. It is like one of the parties in court paying the judge's salary or one of the teams in a competition paying the salary of the referee. The credit rating agencies assured Congress and the investing public that they could ``manage'' that conflict and that their ratings were independent and rigorous. But the documents tell a different story. First, some background. Credit ratings assess the creditworthiness of a particular financial instrument like a corporate bond, mortgage-backed security, or CDO. Essentially, they predict the likelihood that the debt will be repaid. We have all heard of AAA ratings, which are at the top of the credit rating scale and are supposed to designate the safest investments. The ratings below that, which range from AA down to C, designate investments at greater risk of default. Investments with AAA ratings have historically had an expected loss rate of less than 0.05 percent, while the expected loss rate for BBB investments is under 1 percent. That is why financial instruments with AAA through BBB ratings are generally called ``investment grade,'' while those with ratings of BBB or Baa3 or below are referred to as ``below investment grade'' or sometimes ``junk'' investments. A variety of U.S. laws and regulations rely on credit ratings to gauge risk. For example, the amount of risk-based capital that a bank must hold is determined in part by the credit ratings of its investments. Some investors, like pension funds, are barred from holding below-investment-grade assets. Because so many statutes and regulations reference ratings, issuers of securities and other financial instruments work hard to obtain favorable credit ratings to ensure more investors can buy their products. Over the last 10 years, Wall Street has engineered ever more complex financial instruments for sale to investors. Because these so-called structured finance products are so hard to understand, investors often place heavy reliance on credit ratings to determine whether they can or should buy them. Residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBSs), are one of the oldest types of structured finance. To create these securities, issuers bundle up large numbers of home mortgages into a pool, figure out the total revenue coming into the pool from all the mortgages, and then design a ``waterfall'' that assigns portions of the total incoming revenue to what are called ``tranches.'' Tranches are not collections of mortgages; they are simply recipients of income from the waterfall of mortgage payments coming into the pool. Each tranche is used to issue a mortgaged-backed security that receives a credit rating and is then sold to investors. The tranches that are first in line to receive revenues represent the safest investments in the pool and are designed to get AAA ratings. Tranches lower down the line get their revenues only after the more senior tranches are paid, and their securities get lower credit ratings. Wall Street did not stop there. They collected securities from RMBS transactions, put those into a pool, and resecuritized them into what are called collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). A CDO might contain, for example, BBB-rated securities from 100 different residential mortgage pools. CDOs often also contain other types of assets, such as corporate bonds or credit default swaps. Wall Street firms also created so-called synthetic CDOs which did not contain actual assets but simply referenced them. Like RMBS mortgage pools, CDOs were sliced and diced into tranches and the resulting tranches used to create securities. The securities were rated--some AAA--and then sold to investors. In exchange for large fees, Wall Street firms helped design the RMBS and CDO securities, worked with the credit rating agencies to obtain favorable ratings, and then sold the securities. Without credit ratings, Wall Street would have had a much harder time selling those products because each investor would have had to rely on themselves to figure them out. Credit ratings helped make the sales possible by labeling certain investments as safe, using their trademark AAA ratings. Wall Street firms also used financial engineering to combine AAA ratings--normally reserved for ultra-safe investments--with riskier securities, such as RMBS securities backed by high-risk mortgages. Because the underlying mortgages were high risk, those RMBS securities paid out a higher rate of return than safer loans. When those higher-paying securities also got AAA ratings, investors snapped them up. For a while, everyone made money: banks and mortgage brokers got rich selling high risk loans, Wall Street investment banks earned big fees creating and selling mortgage- based securities, and investors profited from the higher returns. But those AAA ratings created a false sense of security. High-risk RMBS and CDOs turned out not to be safe investments. We heard in our first hearing how many of the high-risk mortgages backing those securities were riddled with poor- quality loans, contained fraudulent borrower information, or depended upon borrowers being able to refinance their loans before higher loan payments kicked in. When housing prices stopped climbing and many borrowers could no longer refinance their loans, delinquency rates skyrocketed. RMBS and CDO securities rated as investment grade began incurring losses and were sharply downgraded. For example, take a CDO known as Vertical ABS CDO 2007-1. In early 2007, UBS, which is a major bank, asked Standard & Poor's and Moody's to rate this CDO. The UBS banker, however, failed to cooperate with the analysts. One S&P analyst wrote in an email to colleagues: ``Don't see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation. Deals likely not to perform.'' That is Exhibit 94b.\1\ \1\ See Exhibit No. 94b, which appears in the Appendix on page 599. Despite the analyst's judgment that the CDO was unlikely to perform, Standard & Poor's rated it anyway. So did Moody's. In April 2007, both agencies gave AAA ratings to the CDO's top four tranches. But just 6 months later, both agencies downgraded the CDO, which later collapsed. One of the purchasers, a hedge fund called Pursuit Partners, sued over the CDO's quick demise. Standard & Poor's and Moody's were dropped from the lawsuit since current law does not authorize private lawsuits against them even for reckless or unreasonable ratings, but the court ordered UBS to set aside $35 million for a possible award to the investor. The legal pleadings included internal emails at UBS referring to the supposedly investment- grade Vertical securities as ``crap'' at the same time the bank was selling them. Take another example. In January 2007, S&P was asked to rate an RMBS being assembled by Goldman Sachs using subprime loans from Fremont Investment and Loan, a subprime lender known for loans with high rates of delinquency. On January 24, 2007, an analyst wrote seeking advice from two senior analysts: ``I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral. Since Fremont collateral has been performing not so good, is there anything special I should be aware of?'' One of the analysts responded: ``No, we don't treat their collateral any differently.'' And the other analyst asked a question: ``Are the FICO scores current?'' Answer: ``Yup,'' came the reply. Then, ``You are good to go.'' In other words, the analyst did not have to factor in any greater credit risk for an issuer known for poor-quality loans, even though 3 weeks earlier S&P analysts had circulated an article about how Fremont had severed ties with 8,000 brokers due to loans with some of the highest delinquency rates in the industry coming from those brokers. In the spring of 2007, Moody's and Standard & Poor's provided AAA ratings for five tranches of RMBS securities backed by Fremont mortgages. By October, both companies began downgrading the CDO. Today all five AAA tranches have been downgraded to junk status. Now, those are just two examples of securities given AAA ratings that turned out not to be worth the paper that they were written on. And there are many more. In fact, throughout 2006 and 2007, the toxic mortgages flooding the financial markets began going bad in record numbers. Delinquency rates skyrocketed. It became more and more apparent that the investment grade ratings given to subprime RMBS securities could not hold. Finally, in July 2007, within days of each other, Moody's and Standard & Poor's announced mass downgrades of hundreds of subprime mortgage-backed securities. The mass downgrades shocked financial markets, and the subprime secondary market dried up overnight. Banks, securities firms, pension funds, and others were left holding billions of dollars of suddenly unmarketable securities. The value of those securities began dropping like a stone, and the financial crisis was on. Two months later, in October, Moody's began downgrading over $10 billion of CDOs. On January 30, 2008, Standard & Poor's downgraded over 8,000 securities, including 6,300 RMBS and 1,900 CDO securities, an unprecedented onslaught of downgrades. The CDO market, like the RMBS market, evaporated. Financial firms around the world were suddenly stuck with even more unmarketable securities, and by September 2008, major global financial institutions like Lehman Brothers, AIG, Citibank, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley were either bailed out, bankrupt, or struggling. Looking back, if any single event can be identified as the immediate trigger of the 2008 financial crisis, my vote would be for the mass downgrades starting in July 2007, when the credit rating agencies realized that their AAA ratings would not hold, and finally stopped labeling toxic mortgages as safe investments. Those mass downgrades hit the markets like a hammer, making it clear the investment grade ratings had been a colossal mistake. This chart, Exhibit 1i,\1\ shows just how big a mistake it was. It shows that 91 percent of the AAA subprime RMBS securities issued in 2007 and 93 percent of those issued in 2006 have since been downgraded to junk status. The numbers for Option ARM mortgages are even worse. Option ARMs, which we examined at our first hearing on Washington Mutual Bank, allow borrowers to pick from several types of payments each month, including a ``minimum payment'' that results in a growing, rather than declining, loan balance. The chart shows that 97 percent of the Option ARM securities issued in 2006 and 2007 are now in junk status. \1\ See Exhibit No. 1i, which appears in the Appendix on page 244. Had the credit rating agencies taken more care in handing out their initial ratings or had they issued downgrades in a more responsible manner, they could have reduced the impact of the toxic mortgages. But they did not, and there are a whole host of reasons why. First, let us talk about the credit rating models. Credit rating agencies use complex mathematical models to predict foreclosure rates for mortgages which, in turn, are critical to determine the ratings for mortgage-backed securities. The key problem was that the mortgage industry had changed drastically in the last 10 years. High-risk mortgages like subprime, interest-only, Option ARMs, and hybrids became widespread, displacing traditional, low-risk, 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. The credit rating agencies simply did not have data on how these higher-risk mortgages would perform over time. Traditional 30-year fixed-rate mortgages had default rates of 1 to 2 percent; the higher-risk mortgages were expected to have higher default rates, but no one knew how high. With very little data, the credit rating agencies made assumptions in their models that turned out to be way wrong. Moody's and S&P knew their modeling assumptions were wrong and began revising their models. In the summer of 2005, S&P had revamped its CDO model, but put the model on hold for more than a year, as it struggled to rationalize why it would not use the new model to retest existing CDO securities. It is clear from over a year of internal emails that S&P delayed and delayed the decision, anticipating that the revised model would require existing CDO securities to be downgraded, disrupt the CDO market, and reduce public confidence in its CDO ratings. It would also have disrupted S&P profits from CDO ratings. In July 2006, S&P made a major change to its RMBS rating model, but decided not to retest existing RMBS securities. The revised RMBS model projected much higher default rates for high-risk mortgages and required greater protections against loss, including 40 percent more credit protection for BBB- graded subprime securities. That meant a 40-percent larger cushion to protect against losses. Re-evaluating existing RMBS securities with the revised model would likely have led to downgrades, angry issuers, and even angrier investors, so S&P did not do it. Moody's did not either; after strengthening its RMBS model to issue new ratings, it chose not to apply it to existing securities. Recently, S&P has adopted a policy requiring retesting of rated securities within 1 year of a model change. A second reason the credit rating agencies did not blow the whistle sooner on poorly performing RMBS and CDO securities was competition. The drive for market share and the revenues from increased volumes of ratings created pressure on both agencies to provide favorable credit ratings to the investment bankers bringing in business. A 1995 article captures how the credit agencies used to operate. A journalist wrote: ``Ask a treasurer for his opinion of rating agencies, and he will probably rank them somewhere between a trip to the dentist and an IRS audit. You cannot control them, and you cannot escape them.'' Well, all that changed as the revenues from structured finance ratings came pouring in. Ratings and fees began to be played off against each other. For example, after a Moody's analyst emailed that he could not finalize a rating until the issue of fees was resolved, an investment banker from Merrill Lynch responded: ``We are okay with the revised fee schedule for this transaction. We are agreeing to this under the assumption that this will not be a precedent for any future deals and that you will work with us further on this transaction to try and get to some middle ground with respect to the ratings.''\1\ Now, Moody's assured the Merrill analyst that its deal analysis was independent from its fees. Nonetheless, that is what Merrill was asking for. \1\ See Exhibit No. 23, which appears in the Appendix on page 315. In another email, an S&P analyst commented: ``Version 6.0 could've been released months ago and resources assigned elsewhere if we didn't have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.''\1\ Some witnesses here today will describe how the environment changed from an academic culture focused on accurate ratings to one of intense pressure to get the deals done and preserve market share. \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258. The documents also show how the crushing volume of ratings undermined the ratings process. Despite record profits, both credit rating agencies were understaffed and overwhelmed with complex deals that investment bankers wanted to close within days. The documents show how investment bankers argued with the credit rating analysts, substituted worse assets at the last minute, and pressured analysts to waive their procedures and standards. We even saw instances of bankers pushing to remove analysts who were not playing ball. And at times, analysts who resisted banker demands or challenged ratings were restricted from rating deals. A focus on short-term profits also permeated the industry. One of the witnesses here today will describe how when he once questioned a banker about the terms of a deal, the banker replied, ``IBG-YBG.'' When asked what that meant, the banker explained, ``I'll be gone, you'll be gone.'' In other words, why give me a hard time when we are both making a lot of money and will be long gone before the house of cards comes crashing down? In addition to inaccurate models and competitive pressures, the credit rating agencies failed to adjust their ratings to take into account credit risks from the fraud and lax underwriting standards that increasingly characterized the mortgages securitized and sold on Wall Street. In August 2006, an S&P employee wrote: ``here has been rampant appraisal and underwriting fraud in the industry for quite some time as pressure has mounted to feed the origination machine.''\2\ In September 2006, another S&P employee wrote: ``I think it is telling us that underwriting fraud, appraisal fraud, and the general appetite for new product among originators is resulting in loans being made that should not be made.''\3\ A colleague responded that the head of the S&P Surveillance Group ``told me that broken down to loan level what she is seeing in losses is as bad as high 40's--low 50 percent. I would love to be able to publish a commentary with this data but maybe too much of a powder keg.'' Well, not taking into account mortgage fraud and lax underwriting standards did, indeed, turn into a powder keg, one that helped blow up the RMBS and CDO markets and triggered the 2008 financial crisis. \2\ See Exhibit No. 14, which appears in the Appendix on page 293. \3\ See Exhibit No. 1d, which appears in the Appendix on page 236. In the fall of 2007, Moody's CEO Ray McDaniel called a town hall meeting to talk to his employees after the mass downgrades that shut down the subprime market. ``What happened in 2004 and 2005,'' he said, ``is that our competition, Fitch & S&P, went nuts. Everything was investment grade. It really didn't matter . . . No one cared because the machine just kept going.''\1\ \1\ See Exhibit No. 98, which appears in the Appendix on page 684. A Moody's managing director later responded our ``errors make us look either incompetent at credit analysis, or like we sold our soul to the devil for revenue, or a little bit of both.'' He said, ``I would like more candor from senior management about our errors and how we will address them in the future.'' That is what we are calling for today as well: candor not only about what went wrong, but what can be done to prevent still another credit rating disaster in the future. The House and the Senate financial reform bills before Congress offer a number of measures to increase credit rating oversight. Both bills would, for example, eliminate the statutory prohibition on the SEC's evaluating rating models, though clearer language authorizing the SEC to set standards for credit rating models, methodologies, and criteria is, in my judgment, still needed. The bills would also beef up the SEC's enforcement authority toward credit rating agencies and subject the agencies to lawsuits by investors for reckless or unreasonable ratings. The bills should be further strengthened, in my judgment, by directing regulators to tackle the inherent conflicts of interest that arise when rating agencies are paid by the people that they rate. Our investigation provides strong support for better controls on credit rating agencies whose failures contributed to the economic damage still plaguing our country. One more matter. Yesterday, the Subcommittee was made aware of a longer version of an email that was included in the Exhibit Book as Exhibit 23. We were not aware of the longer version earlier when that book was put together, so we have added it to the book as Exhibit 23 Addendum. The emails show Merrill Lynch trying to make a direct link between the fees it paid and the ratings it would receive on a deal, but the longer email shows that Moody's told Merrill Lynch that its deal analysis was independent of any fee discussion. And that was surely a welcome response, but a very inappropriate request on the part of Merrill Lynch. My Ranking Member, Senator Coburn, had planned on being here today and had looked forward to it, but he was called away to matters in Oklahoma, so we will have to proceed without him. I do want to thank him and his staff again for their tremendous ongoing support of this investigation. I want to call on Senator Kaufman, who has also been a major supporter of what we are trying to do on this Subcommittee, and we are very grateful for his being on this Subcommittee and for that great participation. Senator Kaufman.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing, and I thank the witnesses. Since this meltdown occurred, as I travel around, after concern about jobs, the single most concern is about what happened on Wall Street and what are we going to do about it. And I got to tell you that the most scorn is on the rating agencies. That may not be deserved, but that is where it is, the idea that, as the Chairman said, you had this incredible growth in revenues at the same time they were rating thousands of residential mortgage-backed securities AAA that now turn out to be junk. AAA to junk is just a hard thing for people to deal with. How can you miss so badly? The problem we are dealing with today is what happened, but really more important is what are we going to do about it? I think both are important. AAA will never mean again what it used to mean. I do not care what we do here. I do not care what happens. AAA will not mean what it used to mean because people are just beginning to determine the incredible conflict of interest the Chairman pointed out, and also the way that rating agencies have protected and the way they view their job, when you hear them talk about the fact that they really have no responsibility to the average investor out there. That is not their customer. The customers are the people that just does not go with people. People do not understand that. The problem is, outside of the great people that inhabit the United States, that the two greatest things that make this country great are democracy and our capital markets. That is what makes us great. And the credibility of our capital markets is in tatters. Now, fortunately, in the rest of the world, they have capital markets where you even take a greater chance in many cases to get involved. But I do not think that is beginning to be the perception. And the idea that the average person cannot use rating agencies to determine the quality of the product means very simply people will stop using the product. Our markets will no longer be credible. They have lost a lot of credibility already. If we do not deal with this, this is not something we are just going on as business as usual. I spend a lot of time in New York. I spent a lot of time with people in New York. They think, oh, well, over that, now we are on to the next thing. It is not going to be that way. This is not going to go on forever. Our markets, if we lose our credibility, not only have the folks on Wall Street lost an incredible business, not only the rating agencies an incredible business, but the United States of America has lost one of the keys to its success. So what the Chairman is doing here with these hearings is incredibly important if we are going to maintain the credibility of our U.S. markets. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,

"Mr. Raiter","Good morning, Senator Levin and Senator Kaufman. From 1995 until my retirement in 2005, I was the Managing Director and head of Residential Mortgage Ratings at Standard & Poor's. As such, I think I had an inside view of the role of rating agencies in the recent economic crisis. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Raiter appears in the Appendix on page 114. The failure of the major rating agencies--Fitch, Moody's and Standard & Poor's--to adequately assess the risks associated with new mortgage products introduced in the past decade is the result of several factors. The first was the lack of oversight of the rating agencies by the SEC and the various financial regulatory bodies that wrote regulations requiring ratings. The second was the impact these decisions had on management of the rating agencies. And the third factor was the disconnect between senior managers and the analytical managers responsible for assigning ratings. The final factor was the separation of the initial ratings process from the subsequent surveillance of performance of the rated bonds. The first factor, a lack of regulatory oversight, resulted from the failure of regulators to appreciate the unique position the rating agencies assumed in the financial markets. The rating agencies were granted their preferred status by the SEC. Other regulators followed suit and incorporated ratings into their investment and capital rules. There was no regulatory oversight nor were standards established to measure the performance or quality of ratings. The preferred position of the rating agencies led directly to the second factor. Management of the rating agencies came to believe that the increasing revenues and profits they were enjoying were the results of superior management skill and insight rather than the oligopoly granted them by the various regulators and the accommodative Federal Reserve interest rates. This success bred complacency and an aversion to change. This resistance to change was a primary cause of the failure of the ratings and the ultimate financial crisis. Analytical managers were driven by the desire to create and implement the best risk analytics and methodologies possible. Senior management, on the other hand, was focused on revenue, profit, and ultimately share price. Management wanted increased revenues and profit while analysts wanted more staff, data, and IT support which increased expenses and obviously reduced profit. In the Residential Mortgage Ratings Group, as in all the rating groups in structured finance, the analysts were responsible for both producing ratings and developing and maintaining ratings criteria. Balancing these two missions was a significant issue in the residential ratings group where revenues grew tenfold between 1995 and 2005, and rating volumes grew five- or six-fold without similar increases in staff. Rating production was achieved at the expense of maintaining criteria quality. Adequate staffing was not the only challenge faced in trying to maintain the quality of the rating process. The accuracy of the predictive models used to evaluate risk was also critical to the quality of the ratings. The version of LEVELS model developed in 1996 was based on a data set of approximately 250,000 loans. It was, I believe, the best model then used by a rating agency. As new models were programmed and tested, analysts continued to collect larger data sets for the next versions of the model. In late 2002 or early 2003, another version of the model was introduced based on approximately 650,000 loans. At the same time, a data set of approximately 2.8 million loans was collected for use in developing the next version of the model. By early 2004, preliminary analysis of this more inclusive data set and the resulting econometric equation was completed. That analysis suggested that the model in use was underestimating the risk of some Alt-A and subprime products. In spite of this research, the development of this model was postponed due to a lack of staff and IT resources. Adjustments to the model used in 2004, with the identified problems, were not made until March 2005. To my knowledge, this version of the model based on the 2.8 million loan data set was never implemented. The final condition contributing to the failure of the rating agencies was the separation of the initial ratings process from the subsequent surveillance of ratings performance. While the rating process utilized ever improving models, surveillance operated under their own criteria. At S&P, the manager of surveillance refused to use the ratings model in reviewing the performance of outstanding bonds. In fact, the resistance to ``re-rate'' bonds with each new model came from upper management. The concern was that ``re-rating'' outstanding deals with new information would significantly increase rating volatility and possibly result in lost revenue. By 2005, when adjustments were made to the model, it should have been intuitively obvious that some bonds rated in 2004 did not provide the necessary protection to support the assigned ratings. In conclusion, it is my opinion that if S&P had vigorously pushed to implement the version of the model based on the 2.8 million loan data set in late 2004 or early 2005, the economics of deals incorporating the lowest quality subprime and Alt-A loans would have disappeared. In addition, the riskiest transactions submitted for ratings in 2005, 2006, and 2007 would likewise have been assigned much higher enhancement requirements which might have made it unprofitable for lenders to make additional loans. If the surveillance department had ``re-rated'' existing deals each time ratings criteria were adjusted, transactions would have been put on Credit Watch or been downgraded in 2005 which would certainly have sent an early warning to investors and tempered their demand for similar bonds. This concludes my opening comments.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF FRANK L. RAITER,\1\ FORMER MANAGING DIRECTOR, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE RATING GROUP, STANDARD & POOR'S
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much. Mr. Michalek.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Mr. Chairman and Senator Kaufman, my name is Richard Michalek. I am a former employee of Moody's Investors Service, a subsidiary of Moody's Corporation. I joined the Structured Derivative Products Group at Moody's in June 1999, and my position was eliminated in December 2007. At the end of my tenure at Moody's, I held the title of Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Michalek appears in the Appendix on page 119. My general responsibilities included performing legal analysis on the structure and documentation of complex structured finance transactions in order to assign a rating to that transaction and to assist in the development of, and refinement to, rating practices, policies, and methodologies used by the group. My regular responsibilities included participating in rating committees within the group, and on request for other groups at Moody's; consulting on legal matters for other groups in the New York, London, and Asian offices of Moody's when requested; and speaking at industry conferences on a wide variety of legal and structural issues. I prepared and published the group's quarterly and annual review and survey of activity. I assisted with the legal portion of semi-annual training sessions for new hires in the Structured Finance Department. During my last year at Moody's, my primary responsibilities were split between serving as the senior legal analyst on the team responsible for developing, refining, and implementing the methodology for assigning ratings to highly complex credit derivative product companies and being the project leader responsible for developing a methodology for rating collateral managers. Immediately prior to joining Moody's, I was a securitization consultant advising the New Zealand law firm of Chapman Tripp, and prior to that I was an associate lawyer in the New York office of the law firm Skadden Arps. I am admitted to practice law in New York State and was admitted to the bar as a solicitor in Wellington, New Zealand. I have a JD/MBA from Columbia University Law School and Columbia University Graduate School of Business. My testimony today is based on and primarily limited to my experience working in the Structured Derivative Products Group within Moody's Investors Service, and while I had the opportunity to interact with several other groups within Moody's, I do not profess any particular expertise or advanced knowledge of the methodologies or practices employed in those groups. My testimony today is also not being delivered with the intention to bring harm to any individual or to stand in judgment of individual behavior. On the contrary, as I hope my oral remarks and written statement will illustrate, I believe that any imperfections, flaws, and failures observed or identified in the credit rating process of structured derivative products are neither surprising nor unexpected in light of the framework of incentives presented to the competent and otherwise rational people comprising the credit rating agencies. Credit rating agencies serve the important function of providing buyers and sellers of credit--that is, investors in and issuers of a promise to pay--an independent measure of the risk presented. In theory, these agents are independent, and because of repeat experience and a rationalization of costs, they should be able to provide this measure of risk at a lower cost than would otherwise be faced if the buyers or sellers produced the analysis themselves. My experience as an analyst, however, in the Derivatives Group and as a resource in the Derivatives Group for other groups in Moody's for legal issues provides what I hope would be a useful perspective with respect to a couple of questions the members might like to ask. I know one question that is being asked: Just how independent are these agencies, particularly within an ``issuer pays'' framework? Another question that is and should be asked is: What consequences do rating agencies suffer under the current or any proposed framework when these measures of risk either fail to perform as reasonably expected or which can be shown to have lacked a level of care commensurate with the risk of harm that may foreseeably befall the user who relies on such measures? As for that first question, in my view, the independence of the Derivatives Group changed dramatically during my tenure. The willingness to decline to rate or to just say no to proposed transactions steadily diminished over time. That unwillingness to say no grew in parallel with the company's share price and the proportion of total firm revenues represented by structured finance transactions. The apparent loss of bargaining power by the rating agencies in general and of the group in particular was coincident with the steady drive towards commoditization of the instruments we were rating. As our customers, principally the investment banks, produced more and more product for yield-hungry investors and as the quality distinction as between the different rating agencies lost some of its importance, the threat of losing business to a competitor rating agency, even if not realized, absolutely tilted the balance away from the independent arbiter of risk towards a captive facilitator of risk transfer. The second question--in essence, what price is paid or should be paid if a rating agency gets it wrong?--is in my view asking a handful of more fundamental questions. Who should bear the risk of getting it wrong, particularly when it is within reach to either not get it wrong or to choose not to rate? If we accept that the ratings are the rating agency products, should all the ratings issued by a rating agency be entitled equally to the same defenses for product liability? I am of the opinion that much more could have and should have been done to improve processes and procedures, but I am not so naive as to fail to appreciate that in the extremely competitive environment of hyper growth where the message from management was not, ``Just say no'' but, instead, ``Must say yes,'' any available resource had to be spent on remedial corrections. Installing improvements were left for the someday pile. I am in the camp that believes that, to some degree, ratings provide an important public good. I also believe that some ratings, in light of the public good they provide, deserve some measure of protection from liability and opportunistic claims of negligence. However, to the extent that agencies are to remain wholly private entities understandably concerned with market share and net profits, a distinction based on the extent of the public good provided might be made with respect to the products being rated. Where some question can reasonably be raised as to the extent of the public benefit from rating one or more of the highly complex or novel instruments, the liability for getting it wrong might be more fairly assigned to the private parties involved. I am confident that if questions of negligence were not easily dismissed by protestations of free speech opinion, at least for that subset of ratings on products where the benefit of the rating falls primarily to the private parties involved, the agencies would redirect some of their extraordinary profit margins into resources and research and would once again have an incentive to just say no. That concludes my oral remarks.

"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Michalek. Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Thank you very much. Good morning. I would like to thank Chairman Levin and the Subcommittee for holding this hearing on the role of the rating agencies in the financial crisis. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Kolchinsky appears in the Appendix on page 140. My name is Eric Kolchinsky, and during the majority of 2007, I was the Managing Director in charge of the business line which rated subprime-backed CDOs at Moody's Investors Service. More recently, I was suspended by Moody's after warning the compliance group regarding what I believed to be a violation of securities laws within the rating agency. In my opinion, the cause of the financial crisis lies primarily with the misaligned incentives in the financial system. Individuals across the financial food chain, from the mortgage broker to the CDO banker, were compensated based on quantity rather than quality. The situation was no different at the rating agencies. It is my firm belief that the vast majority of the analysts at Moody's are honest individuals who try hard to do their jobs. However, the incentives in the market for rating agency services favored, and still favor, short-term profit over credit quality and quantity over quality. At Moody's, the source of this conflict was the quest for market share. Managers of rating groups were expected by their supervisors to build, or at least maintain, market share. It was an unspoken understanding that loss of market share would cause a manager to lose his or her job. Senior management would periodically distribute emails detailing their departments' market share. These emails were limited to managing directors only. Even if the market share dropped by a few percentage points, managers would be expected to justify ``missing'' the deals which were not rated. Colleagues have described enormous pressure when their market shares dipped. While, to my knowledge, senior management never explicitly forced the lowering of credit standards, it was one easy way for a managing director to regain market share. I do not believe that this was done in a deliberate manner. Instead, during the bubble years, it was quite easy to rationalize changes in methodology since the nominal performance of the collateral was often quite exceptional. Easier still was avoiding asking whether the collateral standards had declined or whether some of the parties had ulterior motives in closing the transaction. I began to receive these emails when I was promoted to managing director. They would list all the deals in the market for the relevant period and the amounts rated by Moody's, S&P, and Fitch. I believe that my 2007 dismissal from the rating agency was a consequence of placing credit quality above market share. I was a managing director in the derivatives group, which was responsible for rating CDOs. CDOs were an extremely lucrative area for Moody's: In the first two quarters of 2007, the group generated over $200 million of revenue. This amount accounted for approximately one-fifth of the total revenue of the entire rating agency. However, trouble for the securitization was already brewing. In early 2007, New Century, a major subprime lender, imploded. During the course of the year, the prices of synthetic subprime bonds precipitously declined. The end of this initial phase of the crisis was heralded by the fall of two Bear Stearns hedge funds which heavily invested in CDOs. The resulting price dislocation sent bankers hurrying to finish CDOs already in progress and to clean up their balance sheets. In September 2007, I was told that the ratings of the 2006 vintage of subprime bonds were about to be downgraded severely. While the understaffed RMBS group needed time to determine the new ratings, I left the meeting with the knowledge that the then current ratings were wrong and no longer reflected the best opinion of the rating agency. This information was crucial for the few CDOs in my pipeline, which were being aggressively pushed by bankers. If the underlying ratings were wrong, the ratings on these CDOs would be wrong, also. I believed that to assign new ratings based on assumptions which I knew to be wrong would constitute securities fraud. I immediately notified my manager and proposed a solution to the problem. My manager declined to do anything about the potential fraud, so I raised the issue to a more senior manager. As a result of my intervention, a procedure for lowering subprime bond ratings going into CDOs was announced on September 21, 2007. I believe this action saved Moody's from committing securities fraud. Just about a month later, in mid-October, another periodic market share email was sent to the managing directors in my group. Along with the email, our business manager noted that our market share dropped from 98 percent plus to 94 percent in the third quarter. My manager immediately replied to the email and demanded an accounting of the missing deals. This was the most disturbing email I had ever received in my professional career. A few days before, Moody's had downgraded over $33 billion in subprime bonds. At the time, this was the largest ever single downgrade at Moody's. As a direct result of the October 2007 additional downgrades, over $570 billion of ABS CDOs would be downgraded through the end of Despite the massive manifest errors in the ratings assigned to structured finance securities and the market implosion we were witnessing, it appeared to me that my manager was more concerned about losing a few points of market share than about violating the law. In late October, less than a month after that email and less than 2 months after I intervened, my manager asked me to leave the group. I was given a smaller position with less responsibility and less pay in a different group. While Moody's has acknowledged that the rating situation in September 2007 constituted a ``problem,'' they failed to act to prevent a nearly identical situation in 2009 in connection with a transaction called Nine Grade Funding. Instead of following some common-sense steps to prevent a violation of the law, Moody's management chose to suspend me after I pointed out the breach. Recent rating activity indicates that market participants still prefer the most aggressive ratings. Rating firms which have taken conservative positions have seen their market shares tumble. We will no doubt see the results of this lesson when the regulatory spotlight is turned off. Credit standards will once again plunge as rating agencies race to build their market share. The only way to prevent this from occurring is to recognize that the function which the rating agencies perform is a quasi- regulatory one, much like accountants. A single set of public standards needs to be implemented, to be used for regulatory purposes only. This will allow rating agencies to compete for clients without being forced to lower credit standards.

"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Kolchinsky, for that testimony. Dr. Cifuentes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, thank you, Senator Kaufman, for the invitation to be here in this hearing. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Cifuentes with attachments appears in the Appendix on page 144. My name is Arturo Cifuentes, and I am a professor at the University of Chile. I recently moved back to Chile after living in the United States for 30 years. I spent probably the last 15 years working in finance. I worked at Moody's--I have to say that--from 1996 until the end of 1999 when ratings really mattered and AAA meant something. This is the second time I am testifying before the Senate. I testified 2 years ago, and I made some observations regarding the problem at hand and some suggestions that I thought could be implemented, and I have articulated, I believe, in my testimony today all the relevant points that I wanted to make. So I am not going to read anything. I am just going to make three points which I believe are relevant in the context of what we are talking about here. The first observation that I would like to make is the following: Moody's and S&P are two different companies. They give ratings. A rating is basically nothing but an opinion about the credit risk of a security. Moody's gives ratings based on expected loss. S&P gives ratings based on probability of default. I do not want to go into the technical matters of what that means, but believe me, they are two different things. And they both profess to give ratings based on different benchmarks, different standards, different models, different approaches. They are two different companies in different buildings, different people. If you take a look, even a casual look, at the ratings given by Moody's and S&P, there is a high degree of agreement between the ratings given by these two companies, which makes you wonder whether the ratings are really independent. That is something probably I think that raises some issues and should be investigated in more detail. There are certain mathematical methods actually to do that in a careful fashion, but you become very suspicious if you see such a degree of agreement between AAAs given by the two rating agencies. Considering the approaches, they should be a little bit different, so you wonder are these two companies dancing independently or is this carefully calibrated footwork to make sure credit ratings are aligning with market share. That is something that I think is a little bit concerning. The other issue that I would like to address here today is something that is more just applicable to the subprime market. The rating agencies have said on many occasions that the ratings they gave to transactions involving subprime loans performed so badly because they rely on data provided by the bankers and the data was not good. So allegedly they were not at fault because they used information that they did not have the opportunity to verify and it turns out to be wrong. I do not believe that is a reasonable explanation. For one thing, that was not the case when I worked at Moody's. We always checked everything that the bankers told us. Whenever we are looking at the securitization for the first time, we look in a certain amount of detail to make sure the data presented to us actually was meaningful and accurate. If that were the case, it seems to me as a market participant that if the ratings were given on information that you did not verify, it seems to me that they should come up with a warning, something along the lines that, ``We are giving a rating based on information that we believe is true but we have not checked,'' or something like that. I think that would have been a reasonable thing to do. And, finally, the third point that I would like to make, because this is a very serious problem, is the situation where we are right now, what we really--Senator Kaufman was talking about democracy and capital markets. I believe the situation we have right now is really bad because what we have right now, it is really a marriage made in hell. You have a situation in which nobody believes in the ratings, and at the same time, the ratings are part of the regulatory framework. So nobody believes in these. Still, you have played by the rules. Now, I cannot tell you how critical that is because the situation right now is that the securitization market is paralyzed, the ABC commercial paper market is more or less paralyzed, or it is a shadow of what it used to be. It is about one-third of the size. And that has significant effects on the fixed-income market. There is a perception--and I am going to stop here--that this market is not regulated. Actually, I would say that this is probably the most regulated market in the world. It is just that it is regulated by the rating agencies, and it did not work out that well. So I think I am going to stop here, and then I am going to be happy to answer any questions that you might have. Thank you very much.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF ARTURO CIFUENTES, PH.D.,\1\ FORMER MOODY'S SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, CURRENT DIRECTOR, FINANCE CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF CHILE, SANTIAGO, CHILE
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Dr. Cifuentes. What we will do is have 20-minute rounds. We can have more than one round if we need them. If you all would take a look in the exhibit book at Exhibit 94b,\1\ this is a CDO known as Vertical ABS CDO 2007-1. S&P analysts in 2007 complained about how the Vertical's issuer, UBS, was not cooperating with them, and the deal was unlikely to perform. In a 2007 email, the one that you are looking at there, Exhibit 94b, one analyst for S&P wrote, ``Vertical is politically closely tied to B of A--and is mostly a marketing shop--helping to take risk off books of BoA. Don't see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation. Deals likely not to perform.'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 94b, which appears in the Appendix on page 599. Now, despite that judgment that the CDO was unlikely to perform, S&P rated it. Several months after that deal was rated, the loans began to show delinquencies, and a little later on, S&P and Moody's downgraded it. Those securities, by the way, are now below investment grade. They are in junk status. One of the purchasers of the Vertical securities is a hedge fund called Pursuit Partners. They sued S&P, Moody's, and UBS over the quick demise of the security. As I mentioned before, S&P and Moody's annuities were dropped from the lawsuit because of the lack of the ability under our current law to sue the rating agencies. But the court ordered UBS to set aside some funds to pay a possible award to that investor. Now, the investor had also uncovered an internal email at UBS in which a banker wrote, ``Sold some more crap to Pursuit,'' referring to the Vertical securities which were then rated as investment grade. That is Exhibit 94n,\2\ by the way. \2\ See Exhibit No. 94n, which appears in the Appendix on page 644. So, first, Mr. Raiter, let me ask you: Is it common for an S&P analyst to rate a deal even though the analyst thought, as we looked at Exhibit 94b, that the deal was ``not likely to perform''?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Senator, I have to say that I was not in CDOs and really do not know how they did things down there. On the residential side, at the time that I was involved, it was not unusual to turn down deals if we did not think they were going to perform or if they did not meet our criteria. But as I think as has been pointed out in your opening statements, things got dramatically more haywire after 2004 and 2005. But I honestly could not tell you what they did in CDOs.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. But where you worked, if something was expected not to perform, you would not be rating it, I assume, as being expected to perform?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","No, sir, we would not. As I say, there were occasions where we had some real concerns about collateral, and we just would put such high levels on the transaction, it was not economic for them to do it and we would not rate it. In the late 1990s, Prudential Mortgage changed their waterfall structure, which did not meet our criteria, and for a number of years we would not rate any of their deals because they did not meet the standards that we had set.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Now, Mr. Kolchinsky, you have had years of experience, I think, with CDOs. Should a CDO which is expected not to perform be given a AAA rating?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Absolutely not. If the analyst was convinced that the deal would not perform, that deal should not be rated.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Take a look, if you would, Mr. Kolchinsky, at Exhibit 94e.\1\ Exhibit 94e shows that some of the assets that were included in the CDO had already been downgraded at the time that they were included. Do you see that downgrade? \1\ See Exhibit No. 94e, which appears in the Appendix on page 614.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes, I do.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Both on pages 1 and 2. A lot more, actually, on page 2 than there was on page 1. But, anyway, there are a lot of those that had already been downgraded at the time they were included so they were not performing as expected. Now, if a downgraded asset is included in a CDO, is that something that an analyst would note?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","We had rules that if an asset was on watch, it would be taken down a few notches. Once an asset was downgraded, under these rules it would be used at that rating and no more or no less unless it was on watch.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And would that be a warning sign about the quality of the assets in the CDO?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","It would have been a qualitative warning. Quantitatively, I do not think that left an analyst, under the then prevailing rules, much room because at that point the RMBS Group has said this is our new view and this is our best view.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And should it affect the credit analysis?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Oh, absolutely. With hindsight, I think this is something I tried to do later as we saw that once you take the path down to downgrade, that is not likely to stop. And so securities, we try to implement something where the securities that have been downgraded already but not currently on watch be stressed more severely.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It should affect the analysis, as you indicate, but it did not affect the analysis here. The S&P analyst there, Mr. Halprin, said in his email that Bank of America was using the CDO to take risk off its books. Now, Vertical is a company that was partly owned by Bank of America and was run by several former Bank of America employees. And if an analyst thinks that what is going on with a CDO is taking bad assets off a company's books, should that affect the rating process?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I think so.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now let me ask all the panelists, how long is it expected that a AAA rating should hold?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","It should hold for the life of the transaction and the life of the tranche, as you pointed out, Senator. The waterfall typically pays the higher-rated bonds off first, and as they pay down, then the bonds that are underneath it start receiving the flows. But it should last the life of the transaction, for mortgage-backed, 7 or 8 years.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Would you all agree with that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I wouldn't.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So, in this case, these ratings were downgraded within a year and are now below investment grade. These are junk.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Senator, if I could respond.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek, I am sorry. You did not agree.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","No, I did not. I think that we are touching on something that you are likely to hear later in the day, that, in fact, the common perception of what a AAA rating is and means is not necessarily what the definition of a AAA rating is. This is something of a legal distinction, but at the same time, I think it is very important that this is not lost on the Subcommittee. In fact, there is published by Moody's the migration rates and history of the different ratings that are assigned, and those migration rates represent an average migration for a particular rating. But it is simply an average from a population of which there are tails at either end. Some AAAs never get downgraded, and there are others that are downgraded, unfortunately, quite quickly. And I do think that there is an expectation in the market and there is a proper expectation that AAAs are not going to be issued on Monday and on Friday downgraded to anything else. That debate as to whether or not there should be or is a necessary element of stability in the rating, at least at Moody's, was one that was ongoing.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK, thank you. Let us take a look at another failed rating, this time involving mortgages issued by Fremont. Take a look at Exhibit 93b.\1\ In January 2007, S&P was asked to rate an RMBS with subprime loans issued by Fremont Investment, a subprime lender known for poor-quality loans. At that time an S&P ratings analyst sent an email to a supervisor saying the following: ``I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral. Since Fremont collateral has been performing not so good, is there anything special I should be aware of?'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 93b, which appears in the Appendix on page 589. Now, one of the supervisor's response was, ``No, we don't treat their collateral any differently.'' And the other one wrote back, in Exhibit 93c,\1\ that as long as we had current FICO scores for the borrowers, the analyst was ``good to go.'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 93c, which appears in the Appendix on page 590. So we got S&P employees now that know there is a problem with Fremont loans, but treated those loans like any other. In Exhibit 93d,\2\ there is an email in which S&P analysts were circulating an article about--and this is January 29--how Fremont had stopped using 8,000 brokers because of loans with high delinquency--with some of the highest delinquency rates in the industry coming from those brokers. \2\ See Exhibit No. 93d, which appears in the Appendix on page 592. Now, in March, a couple months later, Fremont announced in an 8-K filing that the court of appeals had found sufficient evidence in a lawsuit filed by the California Insurance Commissioner that the company, among other things, was ``marketing and extending adjustable-rate mortgage products to subprime borrowers in an unsafe and unsound manner that greatly increases the risk that borrowers will default on the loans or otherwise cause losses.'' And the suit then could proceed against the company. Just a few days later, Fremont entered into a publicly available cease-and-desist order with the FDIC regarding fraud and lax underwriting standards. Despite that information, Fremont RMBS securities were rated by both S&P and Moody's in late February and early March. Before the ratings were done, they knew of those facts which I just described. By the end of the year in 2007, both companies began substantially downgrading the Fremont RMBS securities. Does either S&P or Moody's take into account an issuer's reputation for issuing either good loans or bad loans and incorporate that into their credit analyst? Mr. Raiter.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","The answer is yes, they do. At the time that this occurred, the policy had been in the past that when information was provided to the analytical staff by investors or other originators, they would look into the matter, and if, in fact, it was justified, it would have resulted in a visit to them and a review of their practices and procedures. It could ultimately have resulted in their deals being put on Credit Watch or, in fact, being held up for ratings until the information could be worked out. At this time, in fairness to what was going on, there were rumors rampant about the quality of appraisals and the quality of underwriting standards that could have been quite overwhelming for the staff to try and track them down. But it routinely would have been investigated----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Should have been. Mr. Raiter . And factored in. It should have been.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It should have been. So when the analyst said no special measures with Fremont, that was not what was supposed to happen.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","It was the manager's responsibility to say this is a problem, we are going to get to the bottom of it, because the analysts took their marching orders from the managers that were in control of the criteria and the process.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So, again, when they said in that email no special measures, there should have been special measures taken?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","There should have been, yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I do not know if I feel competent to comment too much on how the RMBS team would have responded to those particular allegations. I know that with respect to collateral managers, and at the CDO level, if there was an issue that was raised regarding the reliability of the origination that the collateral manager was involved with, we might explore it and would definitely send a team to the collateral manager to do what we call an ops review to evaluate those procedures. The information that was obtained from those reviews would be used in our analysis in rating the transaction. But as to the underlying collateral, I am not competent to comment on.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Mr. Kolchinsky, should there have been measures taken in those circumstances?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I think so. As Mr. Michalek said, I am not competent on what occurred in the RMBS group, but had this information come on the CDO side, we certainly would have looked into it, or should have looked into it. I would also say I was not involved in 2007, as this information went through with the folks who rated subprime directly. But there was almost a feeling when dealing with them that there was a ``see no evil, hear no evil'' sort of attitude, and partly I think it is because people who had done these deals, rated these deals, did not want to believe what was going on, partly profit motivated, partly because they were part of this market, and it just should not be happening.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Part of that culture.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Part of that culture. Closed eyes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Dr. Cifuentes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","I can comment on what happened at the CDO group when I worked at Moody's. On many occasions, for example, we were presented with transactions that either did not make any sense or that had a particular peculiarity that made us nervous. The response was either no, you cannot do that, or the rating is going to be very low. It is not going to be a AAA; it is going to be way below. Or we took into consideration when analyzing the transaction or when modeling all the peculiarities that were applicable to that particular transaction. So that is the way it was done at the CDO group. I did not work mortgages, but----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","When you were there, that is the way it was handled?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Yes. I remember many situations, as I said, in which we encountered a transaction, for example, that was done for the first time. We did not have enough data, for instance, so we had to make conservative estimates about certain things, and that is the way we did it.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And that is the way you believe it should have been done?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","I believe so, because I can give you an example. For example, at Moody's I rated the first emerging market CDO that was done. That was in 1996, and we rated emerging market CDOs probably between 10 and 15 deals in that time frame. One of the problems with emerging markets was we did not have enough data. So the way we handled that--we were conscious of that--we made conservative assumptions regarding certain pieces of information that we did not have, and we did something--at the risk of sounding too technical, but I think you are talking about a trillion dollar problem, you better get the technical thing right. So we did something called stability analysis to see how the impact of uncertainty in the data would affect the ratings, and I have to say that all those emerging market deals did very well, actually.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Take a look at 93a.\1\ This says volumes about Fremont and what was known. This is a Moody's email, December 2006. They were talking about delinquency rates for issuers. If you look at page 2, ``Here is a chart of the top 10 issuers'' that have high delinquency rates, and then on the bottom of the next email, it says, ``Holy cow - is this data correct? I just graphed it and Fremont is such an outlier!!'' In other words, they are one of the worst when it comes to delinquency rates. More evidence about Fremont, by the way, about as bad as it gets. They had those articles about the 8,000 brokers and the other information that I mentioned. \1\ See Exhibit No. 93a, which appears in the Appendix on page 587. But just in terms of the deals, I wanted to talk about an email, Exhibit 95a.\2\ This was an email from July 2007, in which an investment banker described a deal called Delphinus. This was rated AAA by both S&P and Moody's. Exhibit 95a described Delphinus as having a lot of cushion, they needed a lot of cushion to protect against losses. Despite that cushion, by the way, Delphinus was downgraded 6 months after being rated. That may not be Monday to Friday, Mr. Michalek, but it is not the way it is supposed to be, right? \2\ See Exhibit No. 95a, which appears in the Appendix on page 646.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","That is correct. It is not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now look at Exhibit 95b.\3\ This is an S&P email chain from August 2007. An S&P analyst wrote here regarding Delphinus, ``t appears that the closing date portfolio they gave us for analysis and the effective date portfolio . . . were not the same. It appears the 25ish assets''--and we are looking at, again, Exhibit 95b--``that they included in our closing date portfolio that were dummies were replaced in less than 24 hours with assets that would have been notched and made the portfolio worse.'' \3\ See Exhibit No. 95b, which appears in the Appendix on page 647. Now, if I read this right, the CDO had given S&P dummy assets that S&P used to come up with its rating, and then at the last minute replaced those dummies with new assets less than 24 hours before the closing, and the new assets, if I read this correctly, made the portfolio worse. And if that had been acted on, the rating would have been worse Mr. Raiter, is that a correct reading of that email, would you say, the way you read it, too?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","These are relating to CDO analyses, and CDO, and it suggests that they pulled--they put dummy deals in the original run, and then they substituted them with loans or CDO credits that did not meet the standards that the original run was completing, or completed on or contemplated, and it looks like a bait and switch and that it did not meet the criteria. But I do not know who addressed it because if I follow the email stream, they were waiting for a manager to get back to them.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. I tell you, these emails are, I think, just devastating as to the kind of culture that was going on here. It is incredible that you could have this kind of dummy assets being put into a CDO, then substituted at the last minute with even poorer assets.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, I would like to point out, if I could, Senator, there were a lot of very good analysts that were writing these memos and asking for guidance, and the guidance was not forthcoming from the top.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I could not agree with you more. But that is the culture that existed here, and I am going to now turn this over to Senator Kaufman.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To follow up on that question, in your opening remarks, you attributed this to bad incentives, which clearly has gone on, the incentives were wrong, quality was gone, quantity, competition. Mr. Raiter, you mentioned the SEC oversight. How much of this was just outright fraud? I understand this about the business, and I am going to get into this a little bit. But it seems to me the things that were going on here, because of the incentives, because of the lack of oversight, people were actually doing stuff that they knew absolutely totally was wrong. Mr. Raiter.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, it is clear from a lot of these emails people were making very poor calls in terms of the analytics. But whether that is fraud or not, it was wrong, it did not look good. They certainly would not want it to have the headline risk in the Wall Street Journal. But there was no one over there watching over them to tell them this is not the right thing to do.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No. I understand that, and I am very sympathetic to that. And if you heard any of the speeches I have given on the floor, I pretty much beat up on the regulators for what they did not do. But I spent a lot of time in business. I worked for corporations. There were always incentives of some kind to make the quarterly earnings, push the stuff out the door, do the rest of it. But when you have the incredible amount of--the chart that he put up there on the number of RMBSs that were rated AAA and ended up turning to junk, many of them you were going after. And maybe ``fraud'' is too strong a word, but things that just are not common business practice no matter what the incentives are, no matter whether you are being regulated or not.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, they were not good business practices, and it is my opinion that there was a huge disconnect between management. Senior management thought that they were responsible for all these wonderful things and that the analysts were just the soldiers in the trenches doing what they were told.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","You talked about a disconnect, and I want to get into it, between the people doing the rating and the surveillance. But talk a little bit about--I have been in organizations, not just government organizations, private-- where there is a disconnect, but a disconnect that this is a pretty incredible disconnect if you keep turning out products, and Mr. Michalek, I will get to the idea of what AAA really means or not. But you are turning out product because of the incentives, because of the regulators, because of the disconnect between management, all those things happen. But you are turning out product that is just really not good product, and how much of it is because of the emails, as Senator Levin said, where people just said, OK, and because of incentives, because of regulators, I am going to do something here and try to rearrange this thing.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Senator, if you have been in business, the choices that you face in a dilemma like this is you can quit.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","If you have a family to support, that might be a little bit tenuous. And some of us chose to do just that. I retired because I got tired of the frustration. But a lot of the analysts that left tried to fight the good fight. Many of them have subsequently been laid off.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","And when you bang your head against the management wall and ask for the money and give them presentations and show them the benefits of the higher-quality rating criteria and they come back and say, ``But revenues will go down,'' you are faced with just that choice. Either you continue to work there and fight, or you quit.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","I am very sensitive to this, and I understand this. I have been there. But how much do you think the management really knew what was going on down in the trenches because of the pressures they were putting on the people down there in the trenches? Do you think they were oblivious to this, that they----",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","You have Kathleen Corbet, the former President, on the docket for the third panel.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","She could possibly shed some light. Budgeting and the whole process of making requests and sending them up the line was a mystery. We never sat down and were explained why we did not get things, why they would not make the changes recommended. They just did not respond. They did not communicate down, from the top down.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. Michalek.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I can tell you at Moody's, while I was there, it was frequently the case that in a particularly sensitive issue, the information did travel upward. I was involved in one transaction where I was asked to consult with somebody in Public Finance. They had a ratings problem that was leading to litigation. And the general counsel for Moody's was at the table. We were on conference calls together. We were talking to the client. We were trying to resolve this. Brian Clarkson--at the time, I think he was president of Moody's Investors Service--was on the call, and this was for a relatively small matter. In terms of the total amount of issuance, it was probably a quarter of a billion dollars . It was not as large as one of our CDOs. So from that alone, I would infer that the information regarding some of the much larger conflicts and potential problems was definitely reaching upwards.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Thank you. First, before I answer your question, I want to quickly come to the defense of the analyst mentioned in Exhibit 95a.\1\ In fact, that analyst that was mentioned was extremely bright and the reason that she was not wanted on that deal is because she asked a lot of very good questions. I wanted to come to her defense. \1\ See Exhibit No. 95a, which appears in the Appendix on page 657.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. No problem.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Second of all, I do not believe in the cause of the crisis there was a lot of instances of outright fraud, legal fraud. There may have been some on the front end with the mortgage brokers in filing applications that were clearly fraudulent. But the way the system worked, you had a chain--it was almost like a game of telephone where you pass some information down the line, and everybody changes it just a little bit--not enough to jump over the fraud, but because the length of the chain from the mortgage broker to the originator to the aggregator to the CDO, by the time everybody takes a little cut, changes it a little bit, by the time you got to the end of the line, the information or the product was garbage. So that is why you have not seen a lot of cases of outright fraud because everybody pushed the envelope, clearly pushed the envelope. But because of everybody pushing the envelope, the end product was garbage.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes, but, I can see that in 1 day, I can see it 2 days, I can see it 5 days, I can see it a month, I can see it 2 months, I can see it 3 months. I just find it--these are very smart people. I mean, when you look and see you are in the middle of a chain and you see what is happening, at some point you say, there is something really going on here. And maybe it is nonfeasance. It is not malfeasance. They are not doing it to be bad. They just do not go back and look to find out what they do not want to know, what actually happened.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I think that is right. Yes, sir, I think if you were going to sort of talk about sins, it is sins of omission because of the market, because of the incentives. There was really no incentive to look, to look under the rocks. If the rocks kind of looked polished and nice, OK, we will pass it on.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","This is the third hearing we have had, and this is kind of a common theme. No one knew what was happening. It just rings to me of other cases where no one knew what was happening. But people knew--these are not really dumb people. These are not people that just come in to work, sit in their cubicle, look at what they are doing, they are not reading the newspaper, they are not picking up the Wall Street Journal or Barron's and reading about what is going on with the housing market or mortgage-backed securities or any of this kind of stuff. They are just coming to work, doing their job, getting pushed, and have these incentives. As Mr. Raiter said, good people. And they are stuck. And I do not think it is the good people, frankly, in my experience, like the analyst you mentioned, that were the problem. I think this is a systemic problem here that was not--we talk about it in kind of surgical terms, like incentives and regulation and all that stuff, which are all absolutely totally on the mark. It was the incentives, and it was the regulatory environment, and it was a flawed business strategy, and it was competition, and it was quality over quantity. When you put all those things down, somebody in the middle of this thing would have to be totally, completely--they had to put together the big picture. Somebody had to say, look, we are putting incentives on here, we got this quantity problem, we got the competition problem, we are not having very much regulation and oversight. There is a potential here for something really bad to happen.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","I think you bring up a good point, Senator. In fact, you referred to your experience in the private sector. The thing to keep in mind here is that this is a very peculiar sector in the private market. I mean, to be perfectly blunt, if you are in the private business and you do a lot of things wrong, eventually you go out of business. I mean, that might be evident. Arthur Andersen does not exist anymore, for example. In the rating business, because of some really flawed regulatory framework, there is no penalty for giving bad ratings. In fact, we are having this conversation 2 years after my first--and the rating agencies, they keep issuing ratings and they keep collecting fees for that. So, in my opinion, one of the problems is the regulatory framework. Today the barriers to entry into the credit rating business are tremendous. There was a law that was passed by Congress, the Rating Agency Act. If you want to start a new rating agency, you have to show that you have been in operation for 3 years giving ratings and collecting fees. Now, who is going to pay you for a 3-year period to give ratings that do not have any validity? So, in my opinion, that is something that needs to be changed because one of the problems we have right now, there is no penalty for getting out ratings that are unreliable. I mean, basically the rating agencies were giving a free gift, and you cannot blame them for that. I mean, they are taking advantage of a very unique opportunity to bring money in.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek, I think you have got at the other key point in this whole discussion, especially on the hearing today, and that is that you want to make sure that the Subcommittee understands what AAA really means.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Correct.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And I think there is such an incredible disparity between what everyone reads AAA to be and what AAA means.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","To the rating agencies, in the disclosure documents, I think there is a disparity--Senator Levin used the term ``safe,'' and I do not think that ``safe'' is correct, as a description--it is definitely the commonly understood adjective that you would use, but to be perfectly honest, I can think of an illustrating example--when this first debate first came up, there was a transaction that I was working on with an analyst that there was problematic--because of the particular assets that were in the pool--and they were not yet placed on negative Credit Watch, so quantitatively we could not take the haircut that we knew was going to be coming. And through some other measures, we were able to anticipate that there was going to be a likelihood that this would not hold its rating for a very long period of time. However, on the closing date, it did meet the published criteria. It did reach that particular quantitative number, and we could not say no--this was sort of at the beginning of the cultural change. We could not say it is a ``different'' AAA.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And, by the way, I am very sensitive to that. It is hard to give ratings to agencies. It is hard to figure out what is going to happen. And in cases like that, if what transpired after that had not happened, I would be sitting here as the most sympathetic man in the room to what you are saying. The question is at some point it went from that--which was a tough decision. And when you talk to the rating agencies or listen to what the rating agencies say, they still think it is like that. You just do not understand. We have these very difficult questions that we have to deal with. So AAA does not mean that it is going to be here forever, and AAA does not mean this and AAA does not mean that. Yes, AAA does not mean thousands of securities that are rated AAA that 2 years later are junk. So this is not a discussion--we are not having the first discussion, the discussion that I always learned about in business school, and also about what rating agencies are. I know what rating agencies are. And that is what they used to be. But when you are faced with a situation where because, again--because of not regulating the rating--so what is it that rating agencies are? AAA does not mean AAA. It does not mean AAA based on your very good definition of what it used to be. But AAA does not mean the same. So how do you deal with this, the fact that you had this systemic--is it fair to say a systemic problem?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I think so.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And how do you get at that so that specific problem--and we are going to have all kinds of new problems. We do it around here all the time. But how do you deal with that systemic problem?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","In my opinion, I think that we would really have to begin with what we are disclosing. I personally believe that there are products that deserve a commonly understood rating, that the public can say this is safe, because the rating is saying that it is safe. And I think that for a large number of the highly complex structured products, it is a different ball game. And I think that to the extent that you are able to distinguish between those products that are clearly in the different ball game, then the caveat of buyer beware is more appropriately applied. But for that portion of the products that I think the enormous public good that comes from having an independent arbiter of risk apply a commonly understood and accepted measure of that risk, I think that is something that we should seek to preserve, and so that it would eliminate that bleed, if you will, from the extreme debate or debatable conversation that goes on with respect to the highly complex products, into what really should be beyond debate with respect to what is safe and what is definitely contributing to the public good.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And do you think you could do that? I mean, realizing that there would be some securities in the middle that would be--but having the idea that for what is commonly known as AAA corporate bonds you have one thing; for credit default swap you have something different.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I think that it would require an impetus from outside. Clearly, the rating agencies do not, as it has already been demonstrated, have an internal incentive given the way that they are structured to pursue market share and to pursue profits, to install that kind of change, at least not to be the first one to install that kind of change. I had the somewhat naive idea when I joined Moody's that there was a particular quality that Moody's was offering, and that was something that the company was going to seek to defend over time, and that effectively our brand meant something, and that I expected people to step in much earlier to say we are diluting our brand. And if we had this 96 or 98 percent market share, once our brand becomes absolutely equivalent to the other three, mathematically we are not going to stay there.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek, you have just defined this whole thing. I mean, in my opinion, everybody just decided to go for the fastest possible money they could ever possibly make and not worry about the brand and not worry about anything. I think it goes to the whole thing where we--and we did not have this, as Mr. Raiter pointed out, and the big thing that was missing was the referees on the field. We just pulled the referees off the field not just in the rating agencies but with everybody else, and we said we do not need referees anymore. And I think just like in football, or here or anywhere else, just like why we need police on the beat, not because people are crooks, but because police should be on the beat because potentially they will become crooks if, in fact, the temptations are so great. Mr. Raiter, how do you think we deal with problems going down the road in terms of rating?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, I think you have to have some rules. Actually, you have to have some penalties for not doing the right thing, and there are none, and there are no measures of whether you are doing the right thing.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","What would you define as not doing the right thing, for instance?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, I would say if you have developed a model in the house that shows that it is much better than anything you are running and it shows that you have been too optimistic with the ratings you have assigned, and you do not immediately start to use it and go back and re-rate the old deals so you can warn the investors that we have been wrong, then that is not doing the right thing. And I will point out from a cultural perspective, there were two mantras that we heard at Standard & Poor's all the time after I joined, and I am sure they went on before that. One was a AAA is a AAA is a AAA, and it did not matter if it was a corporate, a municipal, or the new structured products. And they used the transition studies to prove that by saying, look, here is the transition of a AAA corporate, what is the probability it might be downgraded? What is the probability it might go from AAA to default, as in Penn Central? There had never been a AAA mortgage-backed that had gone to default from AAA until this latest debacle. In the transition of AAA mortgage-backed's compared to AAA corporates, it was much better. All right? So AAAs were all the same. The other thing that was heard constantly--and it was in one of these emails--if we change, everybody will think that we have been wrong. And that just put a real anchor on any new ideas quickly going through the process because they were afraid somebody would suggest that they had not been right before and they would have liability or they would lose some market share. That was not doing the right thing, and they do not have a referee or anyone to tell them when they have crossed that line.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Well, the other thing is, look, everybody--there is not a single thing that has been raised here this morning in terms of what the behavior was. As an elected official, you hate to change your position on anything because it admits that you did something wrong. I mean, everybody does--these are all common things. I think the fact that there are no penalties is key, and I would like to get at least a little bit of questions in the second round about grandfathering, and exactly what you said, why there was not more grandfathering with all the witnesses. So with that, I yield to the Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","There is always going to be a debate on how to cure a system, but we know there are a lot of things that should not have happened that did happen, and we are going to debate those cures as to what the remedies are legislatively in the week coming up. But I want to go back to some of the things that it is pretty obvious to me were wrong, wrong at the time, and as complex as some of the remedies are, some of these issues are not complex at all. Market share should not be driving ratings. Would you all agree with that?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Let us take a look at what drove the ratings here. Let us look at some more evidence. Exhibit 5, an email dated March 23, 2005, between S&P employees that I think you worked with, Mr. Raiter. Here is Exhibit 5.\1\ \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258. ``When we first reviewed 6.0 results `a year ago' we saw the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers going up and that was a major point of contention which led to all the model tweaking we've done since. Version 6.0 could've been released months ago and resources assigned elsewhere if we didn't have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Should those numbers be massaged to preserve market share? Does anyone believe that? Mr. Raiter.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","No, sir. They should not have been massaged. I think I stated earlier that as the models were developed by our consultant and they were tested in-house to verify that they were accurate and that their predictiveness was an improvement over the model that was currently running, the models were immediately put into force. We ran out of financing and funding in our budgets in 2003 to put this Version 6.0 model in place. But the preliminary analysis, as Dr. Frank Parisi suggested, was that we were not adequately rating the transactions. That model was delivered I believe in September 2006. They did an accuracy evaluation. It was determined to be accurate, better than what they were running, and the consultant was paid. But they also performed what was called an impact analysis on the ratings. We had never done that before, so I do not know where the order came to start doing impact analysis on the effectiveness new models had on market share. But it is apparent that is what happened.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And what was your reaction when you read that email?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","I was pretty amazed. I mean, Frank Parisi was one of the Ph.D.s that worked on these models. He is very knowledgeable. He is one of the best analysts they have and very outspoken.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you bothered by it?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Certainly.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek, should market share be preserved by massaging numbers?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is it troubling when you see that kind of an email?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","It is troubling in the sense that it is one more piece of evidence of what I was observing while I was at Moody's. One of the comments that might be somewhat illustrative of this is when I had some discussions with Brian Clarkson about the process, his perspective was, yes, we could effectively produce perfect ratings, but we would not be on the deals. And if we are not on the deals, then we are not able to add any value whatsoever. So in some sense, it is like, yes, we take a little bit of this poison, but we are going to save the patient because you have the opportunity to get in there and fight the good fight.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right, and make profit.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","He did not mention that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","He may not have mentioned it, but obviously----",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","It was definitely a part of that. It was clearly--I mean, this was in the context of a discussion where my job was on the line, and it had already been said earlier in the conversation that if you are difficult in the transactions, there is no choice but to replace you.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is pretty devastating, I tell you. Mr. Kolchinsky, what is your reaction to this kind of an email here?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","It is very disturbing, and as the folks on this panel said, this is something we witnessed. Market share did drive the credit analysis, and I think that is why I was also let go from the rating agency.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Because you objected to it being the driver?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I objected to it being the driver. I went ahead and tried to prevent us from what I believed was committing securities fraud.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Dr. Cifuentes, what is your reaction when you see an email like this?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Well, I do not think I have a lot of original thoughts to add after what my colleagues have said, but it is kind of obvious. It is really a little bit troubling.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Take a look, if you would, at Exhibit 24a.\1\ Mr. Kolchinsky, by October 2007, Moody's had downgraded hundreds of RMBS securities, and was in the process of downgrading billions of dollars of CDOs. Yuri Yoshizawa wrote to you, ``Can you take a look at the deals that we didn't rate from the spreadsheet that Ivy sent out last night to double check the information and to let me know of any of the `stories'?'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 24a, which appears in the Appendix on page 318. And an earlier email in that chain says, ``Market share by deal count dropped to 94 percent. . . . It's lower than the 98+% in prior quarters.'' Is this something you got frequently, this kind of reference to market share, up, down, as being a driver?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes, sir. These emails were sent out, the market share emails were sent out at least quarterly, but occasionally on a monthly basis. They were sent out to just the managing directors in a given group.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I will tell you something. For a firm that is supposed to have a reputation of high quality right in the middle of a financial crisis to be looking at the market share issue instead of whether their ratings are decent and whether or not what happened, how could our ratings have been so wrong, how do we improve it. What is on their mind: Market share, market share, market share. Mr. Kolchinsky and Mr. Michalek, let me ask, at Moody's did employees understand that the amount of market share that was maintained or increased by the RMBS and CDO groups influence the size of the employee year-end bonus?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","It was certainly the case in terms of the revenues impacted the stock, and most employees owned either a lot of options or restricted stock in the company, as well as the profitability of the group did influence the size of the bonus, yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","It was even more pointed than that. I think that we underwent a revision in the compensation structure--I am not going to be able to remember exactly the date; I think it was in 2006--where a larger percentage of our compensation was going to be delivered in terms of deferred compensation. So it became more important to see that what we were looking at was whether or not we were reaching our revenue numbers on a quarterly and annual basis which would allow us to, ``maximize our--or max out our bonuses.''",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And that meant that the ratings that you would give or not give to the banks could affect your bonuses?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Could affect your bonus. Clearly, if for any reason you were stopping a deal or delaying a deal or creating an issue with the relationship between the banker and Moody's, that was a problem.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And this is the fundamental conflict of interest that we need to do something about in the legislation. Would you agree, Mr. Kolchinsky?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes, sir. that is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek, would you agree?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Absolutely.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Raiter, would you agree with that?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Dr. Cifuentes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Yes, I do.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And it is legislation which is hopefully going to be allowed to be debated. We will find that out Monday night. But this is an issue which is not in the bill yet, and it has to be somehow or other put in that bill. There has got to be a way that the regulators are going to find to eliminate this conflict of interest. It is shocking that whether or not something is rated AAA or whatever--and that means something to people. I mean, it may mean too much to some people, by the way. It may mean more than technically it should mean. But it means a great deal, and legally means probably too much in terms of where some entities are allowed to invest or not invest. But that fact of life, it should not be dependent upon--the credit rating; it should not determine a bonus of somebody who is giving the rating. It is so clear, it is so obvious, there is such a fundamental conflict here to me. Your testimony is going to be very helpful to us in hopefully getting rid of that conflict and directing the regulators in whatever the new regulatory regime is to end that conflict of interest. It goes right to the heart of a rating, which is supposed to be an honest, objective, independent assessment of the likelihood of an investment paying off. And it is not performing that function when you have this kind of pressure on people to rate a certain way in terms of their own pay. Now, we had a situation, Mr. Raiter, I believe when you were head of RMBS, when you helped develop a model that was used to rate the RMBS securities. Then there was a period where S&P was doing very well in terms of revenue, and you asked senior management to buy mortgage data on the new types of mortgages so that you could improve that model. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And did you get the money?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","No, sir, not while I was there.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. So this was supposed to keep models current and to do surveillance, so-called. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, predominantly to build models, but to be made available for surveillance at the loan level detail.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Do you know why S&P did not spend the money on better analytics?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","No, sir, I do not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now, there are also some things that should not happen regardless of the complexity of how you design a better system. There are some things, it seems to me, that are clearly wrong that happened and should not happen. In the subprime loan deals, a number of loans in which borrowers paid a low initial rate, sometimes interest-only payments, and then after a specified number of months or years, switched to a higher floating rate that was often linked to an index. Did you have any data at the time as to how those subprime loans would perform? Mr. Raiter, did you have data?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","The model that is referenced in a number of these exhibits that we have looked at, the Version 6.0 was the first data set that we had that had a significant amount of information on those hybrid pay option type of loans. And it was the analysis of those loans that suggested that we were underenhancing or being overly optimistic and was the primary reason for trying to push that model into production as soon as possible in 2004 or at the most 2005.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Because you were trying to test as to whether or not that kind of a product would increase the risk of nonpayment. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, the products started to appear in 2003, but in very small numbers, and by 2004, when we built this database, we had more significant information on those types of products that indicated that what we thought--how we thought they were going to behave in the initial versions were--it was behaving worse than that, and we needed to get the new model in place because it had more data and gave us a better look at how these things might perform.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was there a delay in putting that new model in place?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, we had some preliminary results in early 2004. I left in April 2005, and I believe the model was delivered in September 2006. And I do not know if it was ever implemented.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Now, some of the subprime loans also used stated income loans in which the lender just accepted a borrower's oral presentation of his income and did not verify it. In your judgments, would that make loans riskier to have unverified income in these loan applications?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, sir, they were considered riskier.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Would you all agree with that, it would be riskier if there was no verification of income?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Absolutely.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Would you agree with that, Dr. Cifuentes?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Yes. Actually, the real point is what you do about that. I mean, if you know it is riskier, you take precautions and you do your analysis with much more conservative assumptions. That is really to me the bottom line.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Mr. Raiter, going back to you again, you had insufficient data to predict how a new loan would perform. Was there something assigned called a magic number?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","When we could not get the data in order to do a full analysis on a major revision to the model, they would come up with a multiplier that could be applied to the model results that were being run, which were inadequate in order to beef that number up. And it was always intended that those magic numbers would be replaced with full-blown analytics when the data came in. And it is my understanding that there were some magic numbers installed in early 2005, when they made adjustments to the existing model, and if they were massaging information on the 6.0 model when it came out, it would typically be in the form of these multipliers that they would use.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was there a fee charged for surveillance?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, sir. Surveillance was a profit center.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And there was a fee, perhaps a large amount, that was supposed to last for the life of the security. Is that correct? Were surveillance fees smaller than the initial rating fees?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, very much smaller.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But they were supposed to pay for ongoing ratings and re-ratings, were they not?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Right, the ongoing review of the rating.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Let me ask you, Mr. Cifuentes, perhaps. If a ratings model changes its assumptions or criteria, for instance, if it becomes materially more conservative, how important is it that the credit rating agency use the new assumptions or criteria to re-test or re-evaluate securities that are under surveillance?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Well, it is very important for two reasons: Because if you do not do that, you are basically creating two classes of securities, a low class and an upper class, and that creates a discrepancy in the market. At the same time, you are not being fair because you are giving an inflated rating then to a security or you are not communicating to the market that the ratings given before were of a different class. So I think the right thing to do is to analyze or actually re-analyze all the transactions with the new parameters. There is no revenue involved in that, as you probably suspect.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Raiter, were there discussions within S&P about using rating models to conduct surveillance?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes there were.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And were those discussions heated at times? Were there disagreements over that?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, there were disagreements. Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","What was the argument about?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, there was a certain number of analysts on our side that thought that it would make a lot of sense to protect the investors, go back and look at exactly how these deals were performing with new criteria and with the marks that were available in the model to mark the properties when the prices went down or up. And there was the other side of the argument that it would increase ratings volatility which might make us look bad in the eyes of the investor and could cost us market share.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So the market share was a factor there as well as to whether or not you would use the new available information to re-rate the existing securities?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek, was there a restricted list for rating analysts at Moody's who were prohibited from working with certain banks?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I do not know if there was such a list.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you on a restricted list where you could not work for Goldman or Credit Suisse?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","There were quite a number of banks that had previously requested that I not be assigned to their transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And they were complaining about you?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","There was a variety of complaints, that I would be either too aggressive, too abrasive, or that I was asking for things that were not being asked for by other analysts in the transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was that in your mind because at least in some of the cases you were asking too many questions which would negatively affect the rating?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Absolutely. It was a case that I attempted to provide the same analysis to every transaction that came into my view, and, unfortunately, we were not facing the same set of bankers on the other side of the phone.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Let me just ask a couple questions quickly about synthetic CDOs. There was a huge increase in those. I think everyone knows the numbers or at least knows of the large numbers that were being rated. Did those synthetics cause any problems for credit rating agencies? Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes, sir. The synthetics, the key element of synthetics is their complexity as well as their flexibility.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And were they being used to short the market a lot?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","From news reports I understand yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And if they were being used to short the market, would that be saying something about the quality of the reference to the assets? Logically, would it be saying something about the assets being referenced?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I think if you hear all the stories of folks shorting not just a few securities but in size and massively, I think they obviously had a view that these securities were not that good and the whole market was going to collapse.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And is it correct that you supervised the staff at Moody's that rated the transaction known as Abacus?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","That is correct. That was under my business line. I think you are referring to the ABACUS AC1.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is correct.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","In the 2007-AC1. That was under me. I staffed the transaction. I was not involved in it day to day.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware that the bank that presented the deal to Moody's was Goldman Sachs?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I was.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And have you seen reports that the Paulson firm shorted the ABACUS transaction using Goldman Sachs as its agent?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I have seen the recent reports on the SEC complaint.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And have you also seen reports that Paulson played a role in selecting referenced assets for the ABACUS CDO that he expected to perform poorly?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I have seen those.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And were you or your staff aware at the time that Moody's was working on the ABACUS rating that Paulson was shorting the assets in ABACUS and playing a role in selecting referenced assets expected to perform poorly?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I did not know, and I suspect, I am fairly sure, that my staff did not know either.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And are these facts that you or your staff would have wanted to know before rating ABACUS?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","From my personal perspective, it is something that I would have wanted to know, because it is more of a qualitative not a quantitative assessment if someone who intends the deal to blow up is picking the portfolio. But, yes, that is something that I would have personally wanted to know. It changes the incentives in the structure.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Are people usually putting deals together that want the deal to succeed? Isn't that the usual assumption?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","That is the basic assumption, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And if the person wanting the deal to blow up is picking the assets, that would run counter to what the usual assumption is?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","It just changes the whole dynamic of the structure where the person who is putting it together, choosing it, wants it to blow up.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, I could not agree with you more.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you. I would just like to touch on a few things here. Grandfathering. What are the factors in deciding whether you grandfather or not, Mr. Raiter?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Can you define the term ``grandfather''?",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","In other words, finding out--going back and you look at securities, things you have already rated, and deciding whether you are going to apply a grandfather to that.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, you do not grandfather them. They do get surveilled. There are just different levels of criteria that you can apply in taking a look at how a deal is performing. One way is to look at the pool level and decide that we are just going to track the delinquencies, the foreclosures, and the losses. Another way is to use the loan level on the transaction. If you can get updated loan level files, then you can basically re-rate the transaction based on today's economics, today's house prices, and changes in the credit quality of the borrowers and get a better look at how it would perform today if you were going through the process. Those two different ways to surveil can produce dramatically different results.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek, after you changed the model that you were using, you decided whether to go back and use the new model to older loans, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Again, I think this is outside of my expertise.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","In the CDO world, a lot of times deals that were out there and closed ended up being grandfathered. For some practical purposes, some of the models that the deals used, for example, a diversity score model or a CDO model which were provided by Moody's were almost baked into the deal. And as a result, when that model changed--and that model had actually a positive effect in terms of for the deal's compliance--a positive meaning that there is a direct line that you have to comply with this test. There was no way for us to say now you have to stop using that old model, use the new model. We could have applied the new model on the portfolio. We had the portfolio. But that step was not taken. Usually we let deals who used old models continue using those models.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Cifuentes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","I left Moody's in 1999.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","But we did not really have that issue. At that time the market was really very small compared to what it is today.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Raiter, did you have an indication that stated income loans were being used in any of the instruments that you were dealing with?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Yes. stated income loans were there. They were known as ``liar loans,'' ``NINAs.'' When they started using the stated income loan concept in the late 1990s, it was applied to the highest credit borrowers--doctors, lawyers, self-employed people. As they started developing in the subprime arena, again, you started out with the top of the subprime market with the initial loans that were coming into the bonds. By 2004 and 2005, with the new hybrids and the stated numbers, you were stepping down to much lower FICO scores, much lower credit quality of the borrower, and there was evidence starting to bubble up that brokers were impacting the way stated income was put on the various applications, that there were questions about appraisals, whether they were accurate or not. So when they first started out with the no-income, low-doc kind of loans, we did have modeled in the ratings process higher credit enhancements for those loans, and as we tried to collect data on the new products that were developing and how they performed or were expected to perform, we were factoring that into the models. And, again, I hate to beat a dead horse, but we had a 2.8 million loan set that was used to build the Version 6.0 of the model, and at that time it had the most information we had collected on the hybrid loans. And the next data set that we were trying to collect had almost 10 million loans in it, and it was even more powerful.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","So we were always looking forward to getting that additional information to make a better judgment as to how things were performing without waiting for those portfolios to start going bad.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Do you think the decision not to move with the more advanced models was a financial decision, or do you think it was a decision made with the fact that it was going to make things more difficult to give higher ratings and, therefore, be not as competitive?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","I think the initial decisions not to fund it were because of resource constraints and the desire to maintain higher profits. I think the decisions that were made when it was finally developed and available for implementation would indicate whether they were starting to take a more serious look at what the impact on market and profitability was than just the analytics. I was gone by then.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Senator, I wanted to just bring to the attention of the Subcommittee that what you are in part drawing out is an extreme reliance on modeling and on the quantitative analysis that was going on. To the extent that you had a stated income loan or a NINJA loan, effectively it was simply another data input for which you could make some assumptions. So there was necessarily a stepping back on some level, in my mind, of the qualitative analysis of what was going on down below, and instead you were saying, ``Can we model it? Yes. Do we need to adjust our assumptions? Perhaps.'' And the debate would then be around: Is this the correct adjustment to the assumption?",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But at some point, if, as Mr. Raiter said, it starts out being a very small problem at the very top for people with high income and now it is getting wider and wider and wider use, because I can understand, modeling works great because those stated income loans, from everything I gather, when they first started, high income, they had very few defaults. But it was clear to everyone that early on, Mr. Raiter, when you were still there, stated income loans were becoming a larger and larger part of the portfolio.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, they were growing, but in 2004 and early 2005, they had not reached the numbers that were on your slide. And, again, we had a data set that told us that we needed to increase the numbers in our model, and the fact that it did not get implemented in a timely manner, those increases were just postponed.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","But the other side of it is, in all candor--and I do not want to get into an analytical debate. But when you have pools coming in with 1,000 to 10,000 loans, each one with about 85 to 100 data points, it is difficult to have an individual sit there and look at a printout and come up with some qualitative decision on what is a five-basis-points difference in enhancement at the AAA. You cannot do these products without models. And if there is an area that you might address, the Fair Credit Reporting Act prevents the rating agencies from getting the kind of in-depth information on borrowers that would help them gauge the credit performance expectations.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","It is post the loan being made, so it is not going to be a disparate impact on----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Good point. Mr. Raiter . People trying to get a loan, but it gives the credit rating agencies that additional amount of information to help them track and determine how they will behave. We did not get the income. We had to back into the income numbers with the ratios they gave us for the mortgage in the front and back end, because we were not allowed to collect it. So there were some issues there with just the information being made available that would take us out of the box.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Kolchinsky----",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","If I could add something----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","For example, in that situation, clearly you receive 10,000 loans, there is no way you can examine each one of those, and I would not expect a rating agency or anybody to do that. However, having said that, if a banker comes to you and he tells you, look, I have 10,000 loans, these are the characteristics of the loans, one reasonable thing you can do is you take a random sample, see if what you find agrees with what the banker tells you, and that gives you an idea. We did that many times when I was there at the CDO Group, not in the context of mortgages but in the context of different things. So that would be a way to handle the situation.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","On this issue, I am actually more in Mr. Michalek's camp because I believe models are important and you cannot do these without models. But models are--you need a human being to have a quality judgment of what the results are and what the input is into a model. A financial model is like a weapon. You really have to--it could be useful if you are holding it, not so useful if it is being pointed at you. And my experience has been once the model is out there, once it has been published, bankers, originators understand how to game that model.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Exactly.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","And they will--anecdotally, I understand there is some good data on some of these no-income loans because most of the early borrowers, the loan officer knew the borrower, was driving around--was the plumber who worked off the books, had that information. But to extend that information to the whole universe of borrowers is maybe statistically workable, but does not make sense. And that is where you need a sort of qualitative judgment--I know why this was happening, but the model does not make sense to me anymore.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And I think one of the classic examples-- anybody who has read Michael Lewis' ``The Big Short''--was barbelling. Are you familiar with barbelling?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes. It is layering of poor assets with good assets in the same portfolio.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And isn't it almost a perfect example of what you were just saying, where people now begin to game the model? They are not trying to figure out what the best product is. They are trying to put together a product that meets with the model.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","One of the lessons learned for me personally is that averages lie. So if you have a model rolling by an average, it is not telling you all the information.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek, do you have any comments on barbelling?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","It was an early example of how we had to respond in what became an aggressively or an increasingly aggressive game of cat and mouse, that effectively once we had published some criteria and this was the established requirement, we would quickly see that here was a set of reactions--here was a portfolio that presented some compliant averages, as Eric was referring to. And so then there was our response to that, in which case that generated yet another response to that. And so it goes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Raiter, was barbelling a problem when you were still----",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","I think it may have been raising its head, but you can fight the concept of barbelling only by maintaining the models as accurately and based on the most amount of data you can get. And that just requires that--frankly, as the market exploded and the new products arrived, we really should have been looking at coming out with new models every 6 months, a year at the worst. Anybody is going to try and game it, and the only way you can avoid gaming is to keep improving it and changing it so you capture the nuances that allowed the gaming.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Did you have any indication management was concerned about this? This has come up as another one of the problems, just this massive flood of new business. I mean, business just exploded based on the chart we saw earlier, and it is a little like having a restaurant and tripling the number of people eating there without keeping the same kitchen. Did you see any indication by management they were concerned about the fact that we were not doing these new models, we were getting a massive influx of new business, this could be a real problem?",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","No, we did not get any indication that it really bothered them because they were turning us down for staff, they were turning us down for the resources we needed. And what they were looking at was you must not have been working very hard because your volume has doubled and nobody is quitting, so I guess you had slack down there.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","And they were just enjoying the revenue, and by 2005, when I left, we were getting calls from corporate monthly: How much money are you going to make this month? Structured was driving the whole ratings business, and RMBS was the fastest-growing unit.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Michalek, it was 2005 when Mr. Raiter left. I think by 2007, 2008, people must have been getting-- there must have been some understanding by the management that this was not all going well.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Absolutely. There had to be.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Did you ever see any indication of that?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Certainly one good example would be in the effort to try to catch up, it was clear that from 2004 on, we were playing a game of catch-up in terms of staffing, in terms of systems. We were trying to transfer a lot of the input for our monitoring process to sources offshore to try to speed up the quantity that was being driven through. We were working on developing a model for doing the monitoring. But effectively all of the resources were being directed backward trying to fix what was acknowledged to be broken as opposed to trying to get ahead of what was coming. All the energy that was directed forward effectively was how do we survive this onslaught of work.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Did you ever philosophize about what they were thinking in management? Clearly, the brand was not doing well. You could see an erosion of the quality.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Sure. I think that it was common to commiserate, particularly amongst the rear guard, those that had been there longer, and the culture changed the most dramatically, that the place is not what it once was, I do not know what they are thinking. Personally I was anticipating a steady erosion until there was just a pure equivocation between the rating agencies. So it was a matter of just throwing a three-sided dice and you would pick that rating agency, it did not matter anymore. It was disappointing, but for those that did want to try to continue to pursue the good fight, if you will, I think we did our best under the circumstances.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I think the drive for market share was front and center, and any other resources did not really matter as much, and the focus was how much revenue we made.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","I got that. Did you have any indication that management was aware of the fact that the incentives--all the things we talked about, the lack of regulation, the incentives, market share, profit, that they realized that there was an erosion of the product and that this was not a good long-term strategy?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","I do not know. They must have understood that this is not something that could continue, but I am not sure if they did or not.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","All right. Mr. Cifuentes, from your vantage point far away from this, how did it look to you?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Well, my view here is a little bit from an outsider because, as I said, I left in 1999.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","But being in the market until recently--to some extent I am still in the market--I know this--and I could not claim that I was the only person who did--a few funny things going on regarding the rating assumptions and the models at both Moody's and S&P. For example, I remember I gave a talk at the CDO conference at the end of 2006, and I made the point that there were many changes to many things--default probabilities, correlations, things that might sound too technical here. But the speed of the change was a little bit suspicious. There were some changes at that time to something called correlation, which would probably do not have the time to discuss what it means here, but basically it amounted to a relaxation of the standards. So anyone looking at the rules of the game from the outside would have noticed that certain assumptions that were being made in the past, now they were a little bit relaxed, and certain transactions that were receiving AAA ratings probably, with just a quick back-of-the-envelope calculation, you could come to the conclusion that they were probably not.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","I am just going to end my questions now. Just anybody--we have been here for a while talking about this. Is there anything you can say to kind of sum up what you think went on during this period?",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Thank you, Senator. I would like to add a brief point here, if I may, because I think it is relevant. It might sound like a too academic or subtle point, but I think it is very profound, because the problem that we have here, I believe, is a little bit more serious than what we think it is. We have been talking here about AAA, BBB, and the rating agencies clearly were given the right to determine whether something is AAA or BBB or whatever. Fine. But there is another level of complexity here. Congress has given the rating agencies also the right to define what AAA means, or BBB for that matter. So, in effect, Congress has given the rating agencies the right to legislate, and this is a little bit crazy because let me give you an example, and I think I am going to finish my statement here. But I think sometimes an example is a little bit more clear than a lengthy explanation. Suppose you pass a law stating that, say, in Washington, DC, you cannot build a tall building, but you forget to define what ``tall'' means. And now there is a private company that will decide what ``tall building'' means. So that company might decide that it is a five-story building. Next year they might change, and it is a ten-story building. So that remains undefined. So that is the situation we have right now. Nobody knows what BBB means. The only thing that is known is that, for example, if you are a particular company, you cannot buy anything with a rating below BBB. If you are a pension fund and you buy a BBB asset and it is downgraded, you might be forced to sell. But who knew what BBB means? Well, it does not really matter because the rating agencies not only determine whether something is BBB, but they can change the definition of what BBB means. And I think that is a very extraordinary state of affairs. I mean, it is really--it is very screwed up at a very fundamental level.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Because essentially the ratings are used by the regulatory agencies to make decisions and, therefore, you are right, I mean, I never thought of it that way, but essentially the rating agencies are determining on their own--",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Exactly. Senator Kaufman . What these ratings actually are, and then the ratings are used----",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Legislating all the time.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I just have a couple more questions for this panel. Did investment bankers apply pressure in connection with rating analysts during the rating process? We have already seen some evidence of pressure, but in terms of, for instance, getting deals done quickly, increasing size of the tranches to make additional money, were those kind of pressures put on the analysts during the rating process? Mr. Kolchinsky.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Yes, all the time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","It was part of the daily workload.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Raiter.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","Well, it was not particularly prominent in residential because our model was distributed. Everybody got the same answer. We could not have Bear Stearns run a deal and bring it in and get a structure and have Goldman bring the deal in and get something else. People would say, ``Well, how did they get a different transaction?'' So we were somewhat insulated.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","In your particular area.",Speech,
"Mr. Raiter","In this particular area, yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And in terms of that kind of pressure that you felt, let me ask you, Mr. Kolchinsky. Did you ever hear the phrase IBG-YBG?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Not until today, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Michalek, did you ever hear of that?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","That was quoted to me.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","When you worked there?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I was working on a transaction, and I think it was--well, the name of the bank is not relevant. It was a large bulge bracket bank.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It was a large?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Bulge bracket bank.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","What does that mean?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","A bulge bracket bank is describing one of the largest banks that has a large balance sheet.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. What bank is that?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","I think it was Deutsche Bank.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. And then, what does it mean?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","IBG-YBG was explained to me to mean, ``I'll be gone, you'll be gone. So why are you making life difficult right now over this particular comment?'' Effectively--I mean, he said it laughingly as if you are losing perspective here.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did it mean to you that basically you ought to think short term because everybody would be gone before the chickens came home to roost?",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","When it was originally told to me, I did not realize how that thinking really was driving much of what was going on, actually.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Short-term thinking.",Speech,
"Mr. Michalek","Short term, get this deal done, get this quarter closed, get this bonus booked, because I do not know whether or not my group is going to be here at the end of next quarter, so I have to think of this next bonus.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Who basically did your agency think was the client? Was it the investment banker or was it the investor?",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","It was the banker. The bankers were typically referred to as clients. If an investor called, they would be clients, but they never did. It was just simply the bankers, and they were the clients.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Do you have any more?",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you. You have been very helpful, all of you. Some of you have come a long distance. We greatly appreciate it.",Speech,
"Mr. Kolchinsky","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Cifuentes","Thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","We will now move to our second panel of witnesses: Susan Barnes, currently Managing Director for Mortgage-Backed Securities and former North American Practice Leader of Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities at Standard & Poor's; Yuri Yoshizawa, Group Managing Director for Structured Finance at Moody's Investors Service; and, finally, Peter D'Erchia, currently a Managing Director of U.S. Public Finance and former Global Practice Leader of Surveillance at Standard & Poor's. We thank you for being with us today. We have a rule here, which I think you are familiar with, Rule VI. I believe you were here when I said that it requires us to ask all of our witnesses to please stand and be sworn in. Raise your right hand, if you would. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I do.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I do.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,

"Ms. Barnes","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, good morning. I am Susan Barnes, a Managing Director of Standard & Poor's Rating Services. From 2005 to 2008, I was the North American Practice Leader for Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS). I have been asked to appear today to discuss S&P's ratings for RMBS products. \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Barnes appears in the Appendix on page 155. I want to begin by saying that at S&P we have learned hard lessons from the difficulties in the subprime residential mortgage area. Although the subprime mortgage market improved access to credit and homeownership for millions of Americans, apparent abuses in that market have had a reverberating impact on the economy. S&P began downgrading some of its ratings in this area in 2006 and had warned of deterioration in the subprime sector long before that. We were watching this market. But at the end of the day, the assumptions and criteria underlying our ratings simply did not anticipate the extent of the collapse of the housing market, which has been more severe and more precipitous than we, along with so many others, had anticipated. Although my focus today is on S&P's process for rating RMBS securities, it is helpful at the outset to discuss the nature of our credit ratings. At their core, S&P's credit ratings represent our opinion of the likelihood that a particular obligor or financial obligation will timely repay owed principal and interest. Ratings do not speak to whether an investor should buy, sell, or hold rated securities or whether the price of the security is commensurate with its credit risk. While evaluating the credit characteristics of the underlying mortgage pool is part of our RMBS ratings process, S&P does not rate the underlying mortgage loans made to borrowers or evaluate or regulate whether making those loans was a good idea in the first place. Originators make loans and are responsible for verifying information provided by borrowers. They also make underwriting decisions. In turn, issuers and arrangers of mortgage-backed securities bundle those loans, perform due diligence on those loans, structure transactions, identify potential buyers, and underwrite the securities. Our role in the process is to reach an opinion as to the ability of the underlying loans to generate sufficient proceeds to pay the purchasers of securities issued under stress scenarios that correspond to our rating levels. In doing so, we rely on the data coming from issuers, arrangers, and servicers that other market participants also rely on. For the system to function properly, the market must be able to rely on these participants to fulfill their roles and obligations, to verify and validate information before they pass it on to others, including S&P. S&P's analysis of an RMBS transaction evaluates the overall creditworthiness and expected cash flow of a pool of mortgage loans by, among other things, using models that embody and reflect our analytic assumptions and criteria. The models apply those criteria to particular loan pools using up to 70 different data points regarding each loan provided by the arranger of the securitization. The assumptions and analysis embodied in our models are under regular review and are updated as appropriate. After reviewing the relevant information, the lead analyst then presents the transaction to a rating committee. The qualitative judgments of the committee members are an integral part of the rating process as they provide for consideration of asset- and transaction-specific factors, taking into account the judgment and experience of the committee members. A key component of our analysis is assessing the amount of credit enhancement available to support a particular rating--in other words, how much cushion there is in a transaction to account for potential losses. For example, subprime loans are expected to perform worse than prime loans, so a transaction backed by subprime loans would have significantly more credit enhancement than a similarly rated transaction backed by prime loans. Thus, it is not the case that through securitization poor credit assets magically become solid investments. Rather, the question is what amount of AAA-rated securities can a particular pool of collateral support. Once a rating is determined by the rating committee, S&P notifies the issuers and disseminates the rating to the public. Along with the rating, we frequently publish a short narrative for information to the public. The Subcommittee has asked me to speak to S&P's awareness of deteriorating conditions and reports of fraud in the subprime mortgage market. S&P was aware of these reports, and from 2005 to 2007 S&P consistently informed the market of its concerns about the deteriorating credit quality of the RMBS transactions as set forth in more detail in my written testimony. We also revised our models and took action when we believed action was appropriate. I thank you for the opportunity to participate in the hearing today, and I would be happy to answer any questions you have.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF SUSAN BARNES,\1\ CURRENT MANAGING DIRECTOR, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, FORMER NORTH AMERICAN PRACTICE LEADER, RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, STANDARD & POOR'S

"Ms. Yoshizawa","Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman and Senator Kaufman. I am Yuri Yoshizawa, Senior Managing Director of the Derivatives Group at Moody's Investors Service. My group rates various types of derivative securities, including collateralized debt obligations, better known as CDOs. I would like to thank you for the opportunity to provide our views today. \1\ The joint prepared statement of Ms. Yoshizawa and Mr. McDaniel appears in the Appendix on page 186. Moody's plays an important but narrow role in the investment information industry. We offer reasoned, independent, forward-looking opinions about credit risk. We publish credit rating opinions and credit research about entities, including corporations and governments active in the debt capital markets globally. Our credit ratings are opinions about the future likelihood of full and timely repayment of debt obligations, such as notes, bonds, and commercial paper. In rating debt securities, regardless of whether the debt is issued by a CDO or by a corporation, Moody's analysts follow established analytical methodologies and adhere to established procedures. I will discuss these as they pertain to CDOs, but first I would like to give a brief overview of what CDOs are. CDOs have been around since the early 1990s. CDOs cover a wide range of instruments and can have in their collateral pools various types of assets, including securities issued by financial institutions, corporations, and other structured finance securities. Additionally, CDOs may either be static or managed transactions. In static transactions, the collateral pool typically is not subject to change. In managed CDOs, the collateral manager can buy and sell assets based on a set of covenants spelled out in the CDO's governing documents. As with all securities that Moody's rates, our methodology for rating CDOs incorporates qualitative and quantitative factors. The quantitative factors include the credit risk associated with the collateral backing the CDO and its structure. Some of the qualitative factors that we also typically evaluate include the governing documents of the CDO, the collateral manager, and the trustee. The relevance of these and other factors will vary depending on the specifics of individual transactions. Moody's runs its rating process through a committee system; that is to say, rating committees decide the ratings rather than any one individual. After the analyst obtains relevant information from the issuer through meetings and other communications, he or she incorporates information from public sources as well as Moody's own macroeconomic and sector- specific perspective. The analyst then formulates a view and presents it to a rating committee. Rating committee members are selected based on relevant expertise and diversity of opinion. Each member is encouraged to express dissenting or controversial views and discuss differences in an open and frank manner. Once a full discussion takes place, the members then vote, with the most senior members voting last so as not to influence the votes of the junior members. Each committee member's vote carries equal weight, and the majority vote decides the outcome. Once a credit rating is published, we monitor the rating on an ongoing basis, and we will modify it as appropriate to respond to changes in our view of the relative creditworthiness of the issuer or obligation. One common misperception is that our credit ratings are derived solely from the application of a mathematical process or model. This is not the case. Models are tools sometimes used in the process of assigning ratings, but the credit rating process always involves much more--most importantly, the exercise of independent judgment by the members of a rating committee. Our committee system is at the core of everything we do at Moody's and is designed to protect the quality, integrity, and independence of our ratings. Having said that, we recognize that we must continue re-evaluating all of our methodologies and processes to determine how they might be enhanced further in order to respond to the evolving market. Let me make clear we at Moody's are not satisfied with the performance of our ratings in RMBS and structured finance CDOs over the past several years. In light of the recent crisis, we have made a number of enhancements, some of which have been highlighted in Moody's written testimony. Thank you, and I would be happy to take your questions.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF YURI YOSHIZAWA,\1\ GROUP MANAGING DIRECTOR, STRUCTURED FINANCE, MOODY'S INVESTORS SERVICE
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Ms. Yoshizawa. Mr. D'Erchia.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Mr. Chairman and Senator Kaufman, good afternoon. I am Peter D'Erchia, a Managing Director of Standard & Poor's Ratings Services. During 1997 through 2008, I was the Global Practice Leader for Structured Finance Surveillance at Standard & Poor's. \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. D'Erchia appears in the Appendix on page 173. As the head of that group, I supervised surveillance for five rating and ranking categories: residential mortgage-backed securities, RMBS; commercial mortgage-backed securities, CMBS; collateralized debt obligations, CDOs; asset-backed securities, ABS; and servicer evaluations. Each of those groups was headed by a separate manager who reported to me as a member of my management team. S&P's structured finance surveillance portfolio grew substantially during my time as the group's head. Our resources expanded to meet this increasing workload, and our growth with respect to RMBS in particular outpaced the increase in Standard & Poor's monitored transactions. Standard & Poor's RMBS surveillance team increased in size by 75 percent from the beginning of 2003 through 2006. In 2007, responding to the unprecedented deterioration in RMBS deal performance, the group's head count increased an additional 57 percent. In order to understand the context for Standard & Poor's surveillance work in 2006 and 2007, it is important to consider the basic process behind Standard & Poor's surveillance review. After a rating is assigned on an RMBS transaction, a new transaction, it is transferred to the Surveillance Group for monitoring. Standard & Poor's surveillance analysis takes information related to the actual performance of the rated pool over time, and it uses that performance data to assess whether Standard & Poor's rating remains appropriate in light of our evolving view of the deal's current credit support. Standard & Poor's surveillance process differs somewhat from a new rating review. This difference reflects the practical reality of different pre- and post-rating deal metrics, but it also serves an important function in providing a form of analytical check and balance. Therefore, each deal rated by Standard & Poor's is subjected to two analytical processes, providing for a more robust analysis than a simple reapplication of the same initial method over time. As I noted, the volume of RMBS rated transactions under surveillance at Standard & Poor's increased throughout the years 2003 to 2007. In the past, Standard & Poor's looked for at least 12 months of performance data, or seasoning, in this analysis and used a variety of internal monitoring tools to identify and track individual deals for closer review. In late 2006, as the performance of recent vintage U.S. RMBS transactions experienced broad deterioration out of line with our expectations, Standard & Poor's Surveillance Group began a process of vintage reviews to prioritize the review of 2005 and 2006 RMBS transactions and to monitor those entire annual vintages on a monthly basis as each month's actual data came in. Starting in late 2006 and through the first half of 2007, delinquency data coming in each month did not resemble anything seen before. At that point, however, no significant realized losses had been reported for the deals under review. Moreover, historically delinquencies did not always lead to losses. Accordingly, there was a lot of analyses and debate at Standard & Poor's to determine what that data meant. As we received more data throughout early 2007, Standard & Poor's new issue, surveillance, and criteria personnel all worked together to understand what was happening and how to respond. During our ongoing analyses in early 2007, Standard & Poor's took numerous significant steps to react to the deteriorating RMBS performance and to inform the market of our analyses. Standard & Poor's recognized the unprecedented nature of the early delinquencies occurring in the 2006 vintage, and it fundamentally changed its practice in February 2007 to place issues on Credit Watch without waiting for losses to develop. Standard & Poor's continued to downgrade ratings as appropriate on an ongoing basis. By July 2007, Standard & Poor's had adapted its methodology sufficiently to issue a substantial number of further downgrades. That evolution continued after July 2007, resulting in further downgrades as the subsequent performance data and criteria warranted. Finally, I would like to thank the Members and the staff of this Subcommittee for giving me the opportunity to participate in this hearing. In my experience at Standard & Poor's, we have always been committed to doing the best we can to develop and maintain appropriate ratings, and I am proud of the hard work that our team put in trying to understand and respond to historic market disruption to the best of our abilities. I have set forth additional information about my own work and Standard & Poor's public discussion of the RMBS market in my written statement, and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF PETER D'ERCHIA,\1\ CURRENT MANAGING DIRECTOR, U.S. PUBLIC FINANCE, FORMER GLOBAL PRACTICE LEADER, SURVEILLANCE, STANDARD & POOR'S
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. D'Erchia. Let me start with some of the failed deals that we went into with the first panel. First, the Vertical deal, if you will look at Exhibit 94b.\1\ This is a CDO known as Vertical ABS. An S&P analyst in 2007 complained about how Vertical's issuer, UBS, was not cooperating with them and how the deal was unlikely to perform. And this is what one S&P analyst wrote in that 2007 email at the top: ``Vertical is politically closely tied to --and is mostly a marketing shop-- helping to take risk off books of . Don't see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation. Deals likely not to perform.'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 94b, which appears in the Appendix on page 599. Despite that judgment that it was unlikely to perform, S&P rated it--so did Moody's, by the way. Both rated the top three tranches as AAA. It defaulted within a few months thereafter. Ms. Barnes, S&P's own analysts were uncomfortable with rating the deal, yet it was rated. Should it have been rated? Should that have been taken into consideration that there was no cooperation there?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, I can't speak to this specific example, but----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But you can speak to the question of whether or not if there is a lack of cooperation and a deal is not likely to perform, should it be rated?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, I would say the analyst would take that into account, and it would be part of their presentation and discussion in the rating committee for all of the members to consider.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But if an analyst concludes, the analyst on the deal, that a deal is not likely to perform, should you be giving AAA tranches to that deal?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right. I guess, Mr. Chairman, what I am trying to emphasize is the committee process at Standard & Poor's.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I understand.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","No one person determines a rating, so they can have an opinion, and you have differing opinions that will come to committee.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","How about if the committee decides the deal is not likely to perform?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","If the committee decided that, then it would either take action or change the ratings that it would assign at that time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. And if an analyst says that the Bank of America is using the CDO to take the risk off its books, should that be a factor? In other words, if the analyst thinks that what is going on with the CDO is taking bad assets off the company's books, does that affect the rating process? Should it affect the rating process?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right. I mean, I cannot speak to the aspects of a transaction that the CDO criteria considers, but whatever the committee thinks is appropriate, and if they think it was material from a credit perspective and it could impact the performance of the transaction, then I would expect that they would consider it, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So that it should affect it?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","If they believe that it would affect it, then it should be an aspect that they should consider, yes, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, I am asking you not if they think something, then something should happen. I am asking you for your opinion.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I would think--yes, I would agree that it would be an aspect from a credit perspective.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Let me ask you, Ms. Yoshizawa. This is Exhibit 94e.\1\ In this 2007 CDO, securities were included that had previously been downgraded the year before, so they had not been performing as expected. Is that common for a CDO to include downgraded assets? \1\ See Exhibit No. 94e, which appears in the Appendix on page 614.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","A CDO can include assets that have been downgraded in the past, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is common?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","It could be common, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Could be common. All right. Take a look, if you would, at 93b.\2\ In January 2007, S&P was asked to rate a RMBS with subprime loans issued by Fremont. Now, Fremont was a subprime lender that was known for poor-quality loans. At that time an S&P rating analyst sent an email to his supervisor saying, ``I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral. Since Fremont collateral has been performing not so good, is there anything special I should be aware of?'' One supervisor said, ``No, we don't treat their collateral any differently.'' So that is Exhibit 93b. \2\ See Exhibit No. 93b, which appears in the Appendix on page 589. The other one wrote in Exhibit 93c \3\ that as long as he had current FICO scores for the borrowers, the analyst was ``good to go.'' \3\ See Exhibit No. 93c, which appears in the Appendix on page 590. Two days later, an article was circulated within S&P noting that Fremont was not now using 8,000 brokers, because their loans had some of the highest delinquency rates in the industry. That is Exhibit 93d.\4\ \4\ See Exhibit No. 93d, which appears in the Appendix on page 592. And, by the way, Fremont had also announced in an 8-K filing that the California Court of Appeals found that marketing and extending adjustable-rate mortgage products to subprime borrowers in an unsafe and unsound manner greatly increased the risk that borrowers will default on the loans or otherwise cause losses. The suit against Fremont was allowed to continue. Then there was a cease-and-desist order that Fremont entered into with the FDIC regarding fraud and lax underwriting standards. Now, despite all this information, we have Fremont RMBS securities rated by both S&P and Moody's in the spring of 2007. Should they have taken those factors into account? Ms. Barnes.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, I would take from this email, Mr. Chairman, that they are considering it and discussing it, and the analyst is bringing up the points, as we would expect and encourage them to do. And the manager is discussing and sharing their views that they believe--I guess the criteria at the time was appropriate and it should not be modified.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, that may be what they believed, but I am asking you what should be the case. Fremont's collateral has been performing ``not so good.'' That does not make any difference.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","According to this email, it does not make any difference. Should it make a difference?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Mr. Chairman, I guess when we look at the models, as we were discussing on the prior panel, the data that is used in those models is used from an array of originators and performance and used to establish the expected performance.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I am just asking a simple, straightforward question. You have an analyst who is saying their collateral has been performing not so good. The supervisor says that does not make any difference. Should it make a difference?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, I would say it----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Do you folks care whether the collateral makes a difference?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Mr. Chairman, the collateral should make a difference.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So why does he get an answer back from his supervisor saying it does not make a difference?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, again, because it goes in the context of what the criteria is including. If you are looking at the overall performance of the industry and how far is it deviating, what they are reporting back to this analyst is that they do not think an outside adjustment or change to the assumptions is appropriate at that time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It is not assumptions. It is having to do with a deal. I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral. Fremont is not performing well. There are all kinds of problems with Fremont. If Fremont does not get a higher credit risk, I am trying to figure out who does. I do not understand how you can just simply say it does not make any difference. You folks are supposed to be assessing credit risks here. Does it not make any difference that their collateral is not performing? That is what the email says. We do not treat their collateral any differently. Shouldn't their collateral be treated differently if it is not performing? That is a simple question.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Mr. Chairman, I guess you mean different than the industry standard. If it is performing differently than what our models projected for that type of loans, then, yes, they should----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is the fact it is not performing well relevant?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","It would be relevant to the analysis, but if the----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It was not relevant to that supervisor.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I guess you have to look at it, Mr. Chairman, in the context of how the assumptions are built, and the assumptions are built on an array of data. So it would depend how far off and where that performance is expected to perform. And just because the performance is poor, it does not mean that a deal was underenhanced. We can have poor-quality loans put into transactions that have an array of credit enhancement that could reflect that poor credit quality. So just because delinquencies necessarily are high at that time for that particular vintage.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It is irrelevant?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I would not say it was irrelevant. What I would say that it was ignored.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","He was told to ignore it. Ms. Barnes, take a look at 93a.\1\ I mean, this is the thing which, it seems to me, is going to shake up folks that are listening to this testimony as to how much these credit ratings can be relied on. Here you have a chart. This is at the top of page 2, 93a. Now, this is a Moody's deal, so I am going to ask Moody's as well. ``Here is the chart of the top ten issuers'' of high delinquencies. It comes back: ``Holy cow--is this data correct? I just graphed it and Fremont is such an outlier!!'' In other words, they are terrible. Is that relevant? \1\ See Exhibit No. 93a, which appears in the Appendix on page 587.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","It is definitely relevant.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So why doesn't the supervisor say, ``You are damn right it is relevant''?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, I guess I am trying to make a differentiating point----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You are trying not to answer the question. Should the supervisor have said, ``Yes, it is relevant. You better dig into this''?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","It should be relevant in looking at the collateral characteristics and estimating the performance, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you. Ms. Yoshizawa, this is Moody's. Should that have been relevant? Is that a factor that there are big delinquency folks that Fremont is such an outlier, they are one of the worst when it comes to delinquency? Is that relevant to your credit rating or should it be relevant to your credit rating?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Well, I am not part of the RMBS group.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You are not what?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am not responsible for the RMBS area. I have not worked in that area. However, my understanding is that the originator and servicer and their collateral quality is a factor in the analysis, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And should be?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes, it should be.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I am glad to hear that. We took an in-depth look in the early hearings into home loans being issued by Washington Mutual, and they were riddled with lax lending standards, fraud, borrowers whose income had not been verified, appraisal problems, loan errors. They had among the worst delinquency rates in the country right there along with Fremont. It seems to me it is obvious that you ought to distinguish between lenders when you do these kind of analyses, and I am glad that Moody's does. I do not know if you were at the time. But it seems to me that it is so obvious that you should that I am just kind of stunned at the reluctance of S&P to just say obviously they ought to be a factor. But I think at the end of the eighth time I asked the question, I think we got the answer that it ought to be a factor. Let us take a look at, if you would, Exhibit 95. This is Delphinus. I am not sure what the pronunciation is of this. Exhibit 95 is a Moody's deal, so I will address this to you,",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","This also was rated, then downgraded within 6 months by both Moody's and S&P. First, in July 2007 it was rated, then in January 2008, both of you downgraded it, and it became junk status. In Exhibit 95a,\1\ an investment banker wrote to a Moody's analyst that ``Delphinus was a mezzanine deal with a lot of cushion, so we did not really care that much.'' That is July 2007. Well, that cushion obviously was not big enough. \1\ See Exhibit No. 95a, which appears in the Appendix on page 646. And then you look at Exhibit 95b,\2\ which is an email in August 2007. This is an S&P analyst. He is writing the following--or she is writing the following: ``Regarding Delphinus, it appears that the closing date portfolio they gave us for analysis and the effective date portfolio . . . were not the same. It appears that the 25ish assets that they included in our closing date portfolio that were dummies were replaced in less than 24 hours with assets that would have been notched and made the portfolio worse.'' \2\ See Exhibit No. 95b, which appears in the Appendix on page 647. Why are dummies being used in this way? I think this is Exhibit 95b, since this is a Standard & Poor's document, I will ask you again, Ms. Barnes. The dummies----",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I am sorry. I cannot speak to the CDO practice. I am not in that area.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Mr. D'Erchia, do you have an idea about the CDO practice?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No. This would be discussing the individuals on the new transactions side, and it would----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, do you know anything about the use of these dummies generally? Have you head about that practice, substituting assets shortly before the rating comes out? Have you heard about that at all? You are not familiar?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I am not familiar with that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Are you familiar with the practice, Ms. Barnes?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Not with respect to CDOs.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Do you use dummies in RMBSs?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Not in this manner, but at times, banks--I do recall, Mr. Chairman, where people could submit statistical pools that they think would be representative of the collateral that they would submit finally for rating. But it would not be a substitution, so to speak. It would be once the collateral was originated from a timing perspective.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. It would not be a substitution of one asset for another.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Do you know anything about the use of dummies, Ms. Yoshizawa?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I do not. As I mentioned in my opening testimony, CDOs can either be static or managed transactions. I do not know about this transaction, but to the extent that it was a static transaction, then we would expect that the portfolio that was provided to us at closing would be the same portfolio as of the effective date.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Take a look at Exhibit 1i.\1\ This is what happened to the AAAs. We ask all of you to take a look at this. BlackRock Solutions made an assessment in February of this year, and they looked at the entire universe of AAA ratings that have been given to RMBS securities from 2004 to 2007. \1\ See Exhibit No. 1i, which appears in the Appendix on page 244. First, subprime RMBS securities--91 percent of the AAA ratings handed out in 2007 are now junk. Ninety-three percent of the AAA ratings in 2006 are now junk. Option ARM securities, these are securities that they looked at--we looked at these, actually, in our first hearing, full of negatively amortizing loans that are issued to borrowers with initial low interest rates but with a much higher loan payment that kicks in later. These are high-risk loans because nobody knew how many of the borrowers would default if they couldn't refinance and had to pay the higher loan payments. We examined at that hearing email traffic showing that Washington Mutual wanted to sell its Option ARM loans starting in early 2007, because it had already decided that they were likely to fail, so they had better get rid of them, get them off their inventory, securitize them, and get them out there, put them in the stream of commerce. And then later, in 2007, they securitized billions of dollars of its Option ARM loans in several mortgage pools that resulted in dozens of securities. These pools won AAA ratings for their senior tranches, and this chart shows that 97 percent of the AAA ratings given to Option ARM securities in 2007 and 2006 have now been downgraded to junk status. The numbers for other high-risk loans on the chart are equally shocking. Alt-A, fixed, and variable loans, and these are the loans with little or no documentation, their AAA ratings have fallen to junk status 96 to 98 percent of the time. Prime fixed and variable loans are not included in the chart. So, does that chart shock you, to look what happened to all the AAA loans? Mr. D'Erchia.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, Mr. Chairman, it does shock--it is shocking, 98 percent, but my group would have been responsible for lowering these ratings, and in doing so, it is a tremendous amount of work, so----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","We will get to that. It took you quite a bit of time to downgrade the ratings, but we will get to that later. Does this shock you, Ms. Yoshizawa?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes. It is certainly not what we would have expected, how our ratings would perform.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now, Ms. Yoshizawa, the first panel of witnesses raised a lot of concerns about Moody's handling of the CDOs, and here are some of the things that they said. Pressure by the investment bankers on your analysts. Pressure applied by managers at Moody's to maintain market share. Over and over and over again, that is what we heard. Pressure to maintain market share in RMBs and CDOs. Next, managers felt like they would lose their job if they lost market share. Next, drive for market share led to deterioration of credit standards applied by Moody's. Next, emphasis on keeping the investment banker customer happy, keeping them appeased. Next, lack of adequate resources to rate deals effectively or to re-rate them effectively. Change in culture. Great importance placed on meeting the investment bankers' demands. Next, the quality of assets assumed by Moody's model was not the same as the collateral provided by the investment bankers. Next, bankers were aggressively pushing the CDO to get done in the summer. Well, we didn't get into that one, so I won't ask you that. But is all that you heard, does that trouble you?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes, all those statements are troubling.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And were you surprised to hear them, or have you heard them before?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I have heard statements such as those before, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Senator Kaufman.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. To continue the testimony, I would like to, just for the record, kind of go through--thousands of RMBSes rated AAA in 2006 and 2007 are rated now as junk. Ms. Barnes, can you just give me what you think are the one, two, or three reasons why that happened?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Senator, the assumptions that we use in our criteria have obviously not panned out the way we had expected and the market deteriorated more precipitously and dramatically than we had expected.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","The assumptions didn't work out and the overall market went down?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","That is why an organization like yours, with a long and honorable tradition of rating AAA, all of a sudden had a massive failure--I think that is fair to say--and your assumptions were wrong and it was just a market thing because the housing market just went bad. Nobody could ever foresee that was going to happen, clearly. If you look at the housing market, it would seem that it was going into areas that it had never gone in before. I mean, there was no discussion at S&P about the fact that there was--I will just show this chart \1\--you had a chart like this to describe the housing prices, that might be a factor? \1\ See Exhibit No. 1j, which appears in the Appendix on page 245.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Senator, there are many assumptions that we use in the rating process, market value decline being one of them, ultimate default rates, things that impact the defaults and the severity. So in looking at how market appreciation impacts people's equity positions and defaults, those would be things that we did consider, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Ms. Yoshizawa, why do you think that there was this thousands of RMBSes that were graded AAA that are now--in 2006 and 2007--rated as junk?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Once again, I am not in the RMBS area.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Well, I just used that as an example--I think you have the flavor----",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We strive for and we believe we have achieved historically a long history of accurate and reliable ratings. And even outside of those structured transactions and others that have been affected by the housing crisis and the knock-on effects, we have ratings that have performed in structured as well as other parts of Moody's. I think that we certainly did not predict when we were rating these instruments and we were looking at the long-term credit expectations on these instruments, we did not predict the magnitude of the housing crisis. We did not predict the velocity and we did not even predict the length of time over which this crisis would extend. I think that is the main reason.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. D'Erchia, do you have any opinions of why it happened?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Again, well, from a surveillance perspective, we had the value of seeing the actual delinquencies and we had never seen that precipitous a rise----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. Mr. D'Erchia . On a comparative basis with the previous vintages in that period of time.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. So this is 2006, 2007. You are doing surveillance, though. You are not really rating. You are not anywhere involved in the actual rating of these being AAA. You are just looking back and trying to see whether they should be re-rated or changed, right?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes--well, Senator, we are trying--one singular goal is to make sure that rating is appropriate, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","But in 2005, S&P was already talking about the deteriorating market. In your testimony on page six, you talk about an article entitled, ``Subprime Lenders Basking in the Glow of a Still Benign Economy With Clouds Forming on the Horizon.'' Following the internal housing market simulation conducted in 2005, S&P had published a study concerning the potential impact of a housing downturn on RMBSes using the following assumptions: A January 19, 2006 article entitled, ``U.S. RMBS Markets Still Robust But Risk Increases and Growth Drivers are Softening.'' So it wasn't like a shock. In 2005, you were already discussing the fact that this is a real problem. But then in 2006--and I guess maybe you are the wrong person--I guess I should be talking to you, Ms. Barnes, in terms of you are just doing surveillance. You are not actually doing the ratings. So I guess I will switch over to you, Ms. Barnes, and also just add to this, in your testimony, on page 11, you recount the same thing. So in 2005, now, you knew that there was a serious problem in the housing market. Take a look at that. There is the chart I was holding up there, which shows the fact that by 2006, we were now operating--June 2006, the housing bubble was twice the--anyway, it is just going through the roof.\1\ So you knew in 2005 that this is a really big problem, yet through 2006 and 2007, you were still giving AAA ratings to a whole series of RMBSes which then ended up being junk. \1\ See Exhibit No. 1j, which appears in the Appendix on page 245.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Senator. Through that time period, we were looking at the market and trying to understand the developments and what was happening, so the study in 2005 that you are discussing about the housing bubble, people were discussing that in the marketplace, so we were informing our opinions and then did an analysis to see what impact that would have on the ratings should that scenario occur. So from 2005 on, we were looking at the different developments, the different types of collateral we were seeing----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, I got all that, but during that period, the main thing that I am interested in about these instruments is you didn't give them a lower rating. They still got the solid gold rating, which I understand, and I think it doesn't mean what everybody thinks it means, which is another problem which we can talk about today. So you are not indicating any kind of--I am really concerned about this subprime market and maybe I ought to take a look and not give every single one of these things, or the vast majority--not every single one--so many AAA which then turn out being junk.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Senator, through that time period, we did release and update our criteria--in many cases, which you would see that did increase our credit enhancements. So we did expect defaults and losses to occur through those periods and did increase our credit enhancement, which we believed at that time would be reflective of the ultimate exposure and default experience of those deals.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Ms. Yoshizawa, I know in your testimony, page 18, by you and Mr. McDaniel, you go back to 2003. We identified and began commenting about the loosening of underwriting standards starting in 2003. And that was 4 years before 2007, if my math is right. So there had to be some knowledge in the management of Moody's that there is trouble here, and it didn't all of a sudden happen then in 2007, there is a housing problem here of massive proportions and we are still rating everybody AAA--not everybody, excuse me. We are still putting out a good portion of AAA bonds, which in retrospect was just----",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Our RMBS group from 2003 on, as we mentioned in the testimony----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. Ms. Yoshizawa . Wrote about various concerns that they had in the market. At the same time, my understanding is that they were increasing enhancement levels required to get certain ratings. So there were changes being made to the methodology as well as requirements for reaching certain ratings. I don't know about the specific practices in terms of when they took certain actions or how much enhancement they changed, for example. It was not my area. However, I am aware that they had been continually identifying and adjusting their methodology.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Did all three of you hear the previous panel?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Were you here for the previous panel?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Senator.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Ms. Barnes, the previous panel said that is not it at all. The previous panel said it was lack of regulation. They said that there were the incentives given to folks within the organization. They said it was a search for profit. They said it was market share. Can you comment on any-- I mean, did you have any firsthand experience of any of those things having an impact on what happened? Or it just didn't happen to folks you knew?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Are you directing it----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, Senator, I have no personal knowledge of people's incentives being directly tied to the number of deals they rate or rated. But overall financial performance of the organization did impact people's----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","But you don't think anybody in your organization you knew felt that the incentives distorted what decisions they were making?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Not on the deal level, no.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Ms. Yoshizawa.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Well, first, from the personal incentives, the analysts were not compensated based upon the performance of an individual group or----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, I am not talking about the analysts. I am talking about everybody up the chain. You just went through the whole thing that the analysts--when Chairman Levin mentioned analysts, you said, wait a minute. There is a whole process here that we go through.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Right.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Management is involved with that, is it fair to say, Mr. Chairman? So we are not talking about the analysts now, just the analysts. We are talking about the whole chain that you had, that both of you went into great detail to explain how this works. Do you think folks in that chain felt like there were incredible incentives for them to get as many deals out the door as they possibly could and with the highest possible rating?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I personally did not feel any undue pressure for market share.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","All right.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I had for a very long time been responsible for the synthetic CDO area. We had very low market share in the 20 and 30 percent range. It was an area that I was expected to explain why our market share may have been lower in terms of our methodologies----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Ms. Yoshizawa . In terms of could it be fees, but I was expected to know why that was the case. At no time was I told that my mandate was to increase that market share--",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. Ms. Yoshizawa . Or to even maintain the market share.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","So you didn't feel any pressure to increase business at all. So what the other panel was talking about was something that happened with them but didn't happen with you? Everybody in the organization, that we want to be a, yes, we can organization, we want to expect as many deals as we can, the more deals the better, that happened to the folks that were on the first panel, but you didn't feel--and people around you, when you went out to lunch, people didn't talk about this, this pressure on us to do more business, to make deals work, to do whatever it took to make the deals work, to increase market share? You didn't feel any of that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I did not feel the pressure to do deals at the cost of credit, not at the cost of everything else.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","How about pressure just to do deals?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We were expected to be able to rate the deals that we could rate----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Ms. Yoshizawa . Those that we could understand or those that we could come up with methodologies for.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We were expected to rate them at the levels that we thought that they should be rated.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","So it is not a black or white as to whether you can or cannot rate something. Sometimes it is. Sometimes you don't have enough information.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Sometimes you think that the transaction complexity may not allow you to come up with an analysis for it a couple times----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","You were in a different environment than the first panel, clearly, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I was in the same----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, I mean, the environment they talked about was something that didn't impact on you. Didn't they--I mean, you were here when they said that there were incentives--",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I did hear that. I never felt that my job--",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","But you never felt--I am just trying to-- basically, they were working in the same company, but they were just seeing things differently from what you did, which is perfectly--Mr. D'Erchia, what do you think?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","My plate was full. I had 100 percent market share.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","My workload came from the new deal side, so that was a factor. I would be in a different place.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. I can perceive that. I think, Mr. Chairman, I am going to turn it back to you.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Ms. Yoshizawa, take a look, if you would, at Exhibit 24a.\1\ It is an internal Moody's email chain from early October 2007. The second email is from Sunil Surana to you. Who is Sunil Surana, if I am pronouncing her name correctly? \1\ See Exhibit No. 24a, which appears in the Appendix on page 318.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Sunil was a business analyst reporting to my boss at that time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Reporting to your boss?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And here is what she wrote in Exhibit 24a. ``Market share,'' and she is writing to you, ``Market share by deal count dropped to 94%, though by volume it's 97%. It's lower than the 98+% in prior quarters. Any reason for concern, are issuers being more selective to control costs (is Fitch cheaper?) or is it an aberration.'' What was your answer to that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We were expected to know why we were not on deals that we were not on. There were multiple reasons for that. It could be because of price. It could be because of credit enhancement. It could be because of other relationship issues, and we were----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So market share mattered? Isn't that what that email says?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Market share mattered in that we were expected to know what the story was----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. Ms. Yoshizawa . And so I passed that on to my managing directors to find out. I am assuming there was a list of transactions and I was asking them to let me know what the story was for the transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So market share----",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","There was no mandate to rate those transactions. There was no punishment for not being on those transactions. But we were expected to know why we were not on those transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And so market share mattered, in a nutshell.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","For various reasons.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And to various people, higher up?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes. They wanted to know why we were not on certain transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And then if you will look at the email, Mr. D'Erchia and Ms. Barnes, look at Exhibit 5 talking about market share.\1\ There is an S&P email chain, March 2005, and this is an email from Frank Parisi to you, Ms. Barnes. Who is Mr. Parisi? \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Oh, Frank Parisi at that time--I am trying to look at the time frame, because he performed different roles.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Oh, I see. OK. March 2005.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I believe he was part of our research group at that time----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Here is what he had to say. He said, ``When we reviewed the 6.0 results a year ago, we saw the sub- prime and the Alt-A numbers going up and that was a major point of contention which led to all the model tweaking we've done since. Version 6.0 could've been released months ago and resources assigned elsewhere if ''--and listen to this--``we didn't have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Market share mattered to him, wouldn't you agree, Ms. Barnes?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Mr. Chairman, I would say yes. He was saying that was a point he believed was being considered for the implementation of the model at that time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. It mattered. Preserving market share mattered, isn't that what he is saying, point blank?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","He is saying that was his interpretation, yes,",Speech,
"Mr. Chairman","Could I clarify for----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, you can try to clarify. I am just reading the words. It says here something could have been released months ago, which should have been released months ago, and resources assigned elsewhere if that had happened, ``if we didn't have to massage the subprime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Isn't that pretty clear?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right. Well, I guess there are two points I would make related to this. I mean, one, there are people with a client focus on the email and market share would have an impact in relation to them. But also, from a----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It mattered to them.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And that was transmitted, was it not, to the staff?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","This email is to the analytic managers of the mortgage group.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes, to the analysts. It was transmitted to the analysts that market share was important.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","It was a factor at that time for people to consider, yes, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. How about you, Mr. D'Erchia. Pretty clear?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, I am reading the words and I can't pretend to know what Frank is thinking when he is saying this.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, just about what he is saying. Forget what he is thinking.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, the words itself, I mean----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Pretty clear, aren't they?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","You just repeated them----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Would you say they are pretty clear?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","With the caveat that I don't know what he is thinking when he says it. But just the words themselves, yes, they are clear.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","We heard from Mr. Michalek this morning, Ms. Yoshizawa, that there was a dramatic change in culture at Moody's led by Brian Clarkson, and that Moody's moved away from a more analytical, academic environment to an environment which is aimed more at satisfying the investment bankers who are paying Moody's for the ratings. Did you hear that testimony?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I did.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did that trouble you?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","It troubled me that was his view, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And he testified that some of the bankers had complained to Brian Clarkson that Mr. Michalek was asking too many questions, he was doing too thorough of a review. They wanted him removed from their deal reviews, and they got their wish. Did you hear that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I don't think I heard him say that they got their wish.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, he said that he was not with two banks. He was taken off the case, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I don't know of a case where he was, no.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You didn't hear him say that he was no longer allowed to work with a couple banks?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","No. In fact, to my knowledge, he worked with at least one of those banks that I know of----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But did you hear him say that he was taken off the case with those two banks, taken off the client list with those two banks?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I did listen to his testimony. I don't recall----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, I am saying, did you hear him testify--",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I did hear him testify----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And was it true that he was, in fact, told not to work with one or more banks?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am not aware of that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you there at the time?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I was there at the time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. So you were not aware that he was restricted in any way from working on CDO deals with certain banks? You were not aware of that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I was not aware of that, no. We had a quite contentious relationship with most of the investment banks that were out there, and there were many times that we would be requested either to remove an analyst from a transaction or that they not be put on the next transaction because it was that contentious relationship. That happened quite commonly. We did not make it a practice to remove people from transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you ever do that? Did you ever remove a person from transactions with particular banks because of complaints from that bank?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Not because of the complaints, because of timing, because of----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Following conversations with banks--where they asked for the removal of somebody from the relationship, did you ever accommodate that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","There would be cases where they would ask, because the timing that the analyst told them that they needed in order to be able to work on a transaction, because their plate was full or because they had other things on their transaction, that at that time that I would say that I would see if I could get somebody else on the transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It was only a complaint that the analyst was not moving quickly enough?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","No, it would be because they were not able to start or work on the transaction, so----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And that complaint came from the banks?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","It could come from--it usually would come from the banks. However, it could also come from the analyst who comes back and says, I have a vacation or I have a conflict in terms of my time and so I would not be able to work on this transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But you never heard from a bank that they really would prefer you to remove somebody, it is just not working out well with that person? It always related just to the person not having enough time?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","No, we did get complaints from banks that they wanted people removed because they were unhappy with the--",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But you never accommodated that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","No, we did not. We may add other people to the transaction. However, we would emphasize that the decisions were made on a committee basis, and so we would keep that analyst on. I may go to the analyst to find out what the issues were. However, I do not remember an instance where I took somebody off because the bank complained about their performance or because they were upset about some of the things that they may have said.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you are telling us under oath that you never removed somebody because of a conflict between that person and the bank?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I cannot remember an instance where I did.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You don't remember? So you are not denying that happened, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I cannot remember an instance where I did that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","How about personality conflict?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","There were cases where transactions would occur--as I mentioned, a lot of transactions could be very contentious. We typically had a couple of analysts who would work on transactions with us or arrangers so that they understood the transactions. But sometimes those relationships could get very contentious and very abusive and so sometimes for the next transaction, I would not put them on it, both from the perspective of protecting the analyst, because sometimes, as I said, the relationships could get very contentious and very abusive and----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So it wasn't just a matter of there wasn't adequate time. Now you are protecting the analyst from abuse, is that it?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","To the extent that we thought that the discussions could get very--if somebody was being yelled at or if we thought that the discussions were getting very aggressive, it was a very difficult situation, and so we did not necessarily want to put them on the next transaction or----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Or if the bank got mad enough at an analyst and it was contentious enough, then you might tell the analyst, we are removing you for your own sake.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Not during a transaction. It would be for the next transaction----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes, for the next transaction with that bank. We are removing you for your own sake.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We could do that. In other cases, I have brought in more senior people into the transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes, but you could removed analysts. You might have remove analysts for that reason.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Not removing them from the transaction----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, from the next transaction with that bank.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We may assign it to another person.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We didn't necessarily have the same analysts working on every transaction----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right, but you may have decided not to put that analyst with a particular bank because there was that kind of a personality conflict.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","That could be the case, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That, you do remember?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Why would you not just tell the banker, knock it off?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We did.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So you stopped your relationship with bankers----",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We would---- Senator Levin . Based on their abuse?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","We would ask them to knock off the----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you ever tell them, we are not going to do any more credit rating for you with this kind of abuse of our analysts?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I do not remember whether we did. I don't think we did.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Would you consider that pressure from banks?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","There was always pressure from the banks.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That type of pressure, to remove analysts?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","There was always pressure from banks, including----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Including that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Including that type of pressure, yes. It was our job as managing directors to push back against that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I want to let you know, in your testimony you are shifting around here a little bit. I want to let you know that. First, you were saying you only would do it because of time, that you only would not have somebody assigned to a particular bank. Then you are saying, well, you didn't remember. Now you are saying that, yes, you might have not assigned a particular analyst to a particular bank in the next transaction because of that kind of heated conflict between the two. So I just want to let you know the way your testimony comes across. It is very unsatisfactory and----",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","If I can clarify, there----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Sure.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","To me, when you say ``remove,'' I think of removing----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That you did not assign somebody to that bank for the next transaction because of that conflict. Who are you talking to here?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am sorry. It is our legal----",Speech,
"Mr. Ross","I am her counsel and I am handing her a note, just like your counsel handed you a note.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I just want to know who.",Speech,
"Mr. Ross","I am Stephen Ross from Akin Gump.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Ross","Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am sorry. I just wanted to clarify the difference between removing someone in the middle of a transaction----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I understand. Ms. Yoshizawa . Because we were being--versus assigning somebody to the next transaction----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. You did not assign that person to a particular bank for the next transaction because of that conflict.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Because there could be--because of the conflict or what happened during that in terms of the relationship.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","However, I wanted to make clear----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","The bank got their way. Don't assign that person to me from now on. The bank got their way for the next transaction.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I think that was something that was asked of us quite often----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you sometimes did it. Ms. Yoshizawa . It would depend on how we felt about how that analyst----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right. Ms. Yoshizawa . Felt about that--the pressure and the relationship.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you sometimes then did what the bank asked you to do, which is not to assign that person for the next transaction.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Not for the benefit of the bank, no. It was for the benefit of--because we felt that our analysts were being abused and we did not want that to happen. We want to have--we may have assigned a more senior person that we felt could push back better.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And the bank got their way, though. That person would not have been assigned to the next transaction. So they succeeded.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","They may have succeeded in that instance, but it was not a practice and it was not for their benefit.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","There was at Moody's, I believe--a man named Andy Kimball, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Does that strike a bell? If you would take a look at Exhibit 24b,\1\ this is attached to the cover sheet from Mr. McDaniel to himself for his file. This is a long memo about credit policy issues at Moody's. It looks like it came at about October 2007, Exhibit 24b. We understand this is a memo that Mr. Kimball wrote. Are you familiar with this? \1\ See Exhibit No. 24b, which appears in the Appendix on page 319.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You are not? OK. Ms. Yoshizawa, we were advised by Moody's Chief Credit Officer that it was common knowledge that ratings shopping occurred in structured finance. In other words, investment bankers sought ratings from credit rating agencies who would give them their highest ratings. Would you agree with that?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I agree that credit shopping does exist, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Ms. Barnes, would you agree that the same thing existed in your area?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And Mr. D'Erchia?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No. There would be no reason to shop----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. So because you were doing surveillance, right, it would not be applicable.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Mr. D'Erchia, whenever S&P made a criteria change to its RMBS model and that change was more conservative than the previous model, did S&P retest the old deals to see if their structure still passed for rating purposes?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Traditionally, no.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And if you would take a look at that exhibit we talked about before, Exhibit 5,\1\ this is a March 2005 memo. I don't think I asked you about this memo. I think I talked to Ms. Barnes about it. Are you familiar with this email? \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, not really, Senator. I am just reading it now with you.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Well, let me read it. ``When we first reviewed 6.0 results a year ago, we saw the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers going up and that was a major point of contention which led to all the model tweaking we've done since. Version 6.0 could've been released months ago and resources assigned elsewhere if we didn't have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Are you familiar with Version 6.0?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Not really, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. That was not something that you had any dealings with?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","The situation is different on the new deal side. They are rating a transaction by looking at certain information and making projections and assumptions. I had the luxury of getting monthly runs and seeing what the actual delinquencies were----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Mr. D'Erchia . And so I could measure against the actual information.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So this was not relevant to your work doing the surveillance?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I wouldn't say that. There is certain information you can get when you are doing new transactions that you just don't have once the transaction has been issued. A FICO score, you would get from the banker, I would assume, on the deal side, which I couldn't get current consistently. It was a difficult thing to get on a regular basis. If the home was sold and refinanced, it was very difficult to get current loan-to-value information, and the like.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Ms. Barnes, if you would take a look at Exhibit 45,\2\ please. This was an email sent to you in June 2005. This is a mortgage broker who was writing you saying, ``I saw you today on CNBC and the reason for my email is that I am extremely afraid of the seeds of destruction the financial markets have planted.'' This is now June 2005. ``I have been a mortgage broker for the past 13 years and I have never seen such a lack of attention to loan risk. I am confident our present housing bubble is not from supply and demand of housing, but from money supply.'' \2\ See Exhibit No. 45, which appears in the Appendix on page 383. ``In my professional opinion the biggest perpetrator is Washington Mutual.'' And then listing what Washington Mutual was all about--``no income documentation loans;'' ``Option ARMs, negative amortization on over-leveraged collateral;'' ``Interest income on negative amortization is not taxed,'' going down to 2C, or 3, ``Option ARMs make up 90% of Bay Area loans in California.'' ``4, ``WaMu's recent bid for Providian is the purchase of another highly leveraged/securitized bank.'' 5, ``100% financing loans. I have seen instances where WaMu approved buyers for purchase loans; where the fully indexed interest only payments represented . . .''--these are interest only payments--``100% of the borrower's gross monthly income. We need to put a stop to this madness!!!'' Did you know the person who wrote about that madness, Michael Blomquist? Did you know that person?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","No, not that I recall.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This was just an email that you got from somebody?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I believe so. Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. He sure put his finger on WaMu. So S&P, you raised credit protection for investment grade RMBS securities because of issues that were raised like this, however, is that correct? Did you not----",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, we did, sir----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You did?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","In the middle of 2005, what precipitated my appearance on CNBC was that we increased our credit enhancement requirements for the Option ARM loans.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. And so you also had data showing that the subprime was not performing in the first part of 2006, as well, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","It started to perform a little differently, but from a delinquency perspective.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That meaning worse?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Worse, yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now, these were some of the factors that led to a major model change to levels in July 2006. According to the testimony, I believe, that you gave to the Senate Banking Committee in April 2007, this model change resulted in more protection against loss, so-called credit enhancements. ``They were increased by 50 percent in the average subprime ratings as compared to deals rated in the first half of 2006 and during 2005.'' Is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, it is, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And, Ms. Yoshizawa, Moody's also increased its credit enhancement for its model by 30 percent during that time frame, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I don't know about the RMBS model, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. But your model that you were using, was that increased by 30 percent?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I am not aware of how the RMBS model was changed.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Let me go back, then, to you, Ms. Barnes. The model changes to Levels was finalized in July 2006. You had better data. You had improved assumptions about how subprime would behave in the future and that would allow you to better predict how deals would behave. It was a better model than the previous model. If you had used the new model to reevaluate existing RMBS securities, it would have resulted in downgrades for many of those securities, is that correct? If you had used that model?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","If we had used that model at that time?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. It would have resulted in downgrades for many of the RMBS securities.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Well, if we had rated them at the point of issuance, it would have ended up with different ratings being issued at that time, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Possibly.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. Barnes, your company did not use that revised model to reevaluate the existing RMBS securities, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I am sorry. I didn't understand your question.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You did not use this revised model to reevaluate existing RMBS securities, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","We did not, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Even though those were all under surveillance, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. And were you familiar with that decision, Mr. D'Erchia?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes. As I said, Mr. Chairman, we had the luxury, if you will, of receiving the current information on a monthly basis.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right. And you did not have resources, as well, is that correct, to apply those revised models to reevaluate all the existing RMBS securities? It was also a resource issue, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is not correct? It was not a resource issue?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No. Having the ability to look at the actual delinquencies and monitor them to see what percentage, if any, turn into losses was something that I didn't have to be predictive. I can see what was happening.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Now, take a look at Exhibit 62.\1\ At the top of page two, this is a Standard and Poor's memo from Roy Chun, is that correct? \1\ See Exhibit No. 62, which appears in the Appendix on page 471.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you ever see this memo before, or this email before? Disseminated to surveillance----",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I haven't seen it since 2005.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. ``How do we handle existing deals especially if there are material changes that can cause existing ratings to change?'' Who is Mr. Chun again?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Mr. Chun worked in the surveillance group and reported to me.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. ``How do we change existing deals . . . if there are material changes that can cause existing ratings to change? I think the history has been to only re- review a deal under new assumptions . . . when the deal is flagged for some performance reason.'' And then he said, ``I do not know of a situation where there were wholesale changes to existing ratings when the primary group changed assumptions or even instituted new criteria. The two major reasons why we have taken the approach is, (i), lack of sufficient personnel resources.'' That wasn't the reason? What he said was the reason, one of two, is not the reason, lack of personnel resources?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Mr. Chairman, I can't speak to the specifics----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, but you disagree with that, is that correct? That was not a reason why that new model was not applied to the existing deal.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","In 2005, I did not know that resources was--",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you ever have a problem in existing resources when it came to your job of surveillance? Did you ever raise the issue?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Oh, yes----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You needed more resources?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, I did.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Tell us about that.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, when we started to see the increased delinquencies, we switched to doing vintage reviews on the 2006 and 2007 transactions. We worked in conjunction with a number of people throughout the organization, criteria, data, management, the new deal side, and also in New York. I had the luxury, if you will, again, it was moving targets with attrition and new hires and terminations, etc., anywhere from 100 to 125 people reporting to me in New York. So when I would have a particular area that needed additional resources, I would shift people around to cover that. At the same time, I would make requests for additional resources for the future so that I could adequately cover all of our workload.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right. And you didn't get those resources, did you?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I got resources.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were they adequate to do your job?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I would say they were adequate to do the job at the time it needed to be done.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Take a look at Exhibit 86,\1\ if you would. Who was Ernestine Warner? \1\ See Exhibit No. 86, which appears in the Appendix on page 531.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Ernestine Warner was the head of the RMBS surveillance area.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And she was asking for help?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","She is asking for resources.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. And you told her, I believe, is it not true, that they would be coming later on?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, I was identifying a potential avenue where we can get additional resources.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","She was asking for additional resources, was she not?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","To do the surveillance job, and right in the middle of that Exhibit 86, you write, ``ou should be getting 4 or 5 new Associates from the 2007 Associate class for 12 and continuing to get them going forward. That might help.'' Her response, I believe, was at the top----",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","That is right.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","``They will be a great help but they . . .''--and this is February 2007, this is a critical time--``They will be a great help but they will not start until August, right?'' So she needs help now, she is telling you, and now being February, and you are telling her she will get a few in August. And then she says, ``Let's talk about anything we might be able to do in the interim. I talked to Tommy yesterday and he thinks that the ratings are not going to hold through 2007.'' Your ratings, your surveillance, you are supposed to make sure those ratings stay.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And she has talked to Tommy--I am not sure who that is--but he thinks the ratings are not going to hold through 2007. ``He asked me to begin discussing taking rating actions earlier on the poor performing deals. I have been thinking about this for much of the night. We do not have the resources to support what we are doing now.'' You kept saying to my questions, you thought the resources were adequate now. But she is telling you, we do not have resources to support what we are doing now. A new process without the right support would be overwhelming. What was your response?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Oh, my response was to request resources, but here is----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you get them?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I got some, as I said----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you get what you needed?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, it depends on the job. On this particular job, I feel we were adequately covered and I think that was----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were there some jobs you weren't adequately covered? In your judgment then?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I would triage according to volatility.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Triage? That means something was being shorted. That is the meaning of triage. If you have two sick patients, you are going to deal with the one that can live. I mean, come on. Triage means you were not providing adequate resources where they were needed.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Well, if I could, Mr. Chairman----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Sure. Go ahead.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Ernestine Warner is in charge of the Residential Mortgage Group. Her job is to inform me when she needs resources and what those resources are. This email is her doing her job.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","What I am doing is trying to address that request. I am looking to move the entire associate class over. I understand we are talking February to August, and she is asking about the interim. The ``Tommy'' she is referring to is the head of the Criteria Group. In the interim, I am looking for help. I am also shifting people over from other areas where they can help support me. This is in addition to and including the data area and the deal side if there was the luxury of people available, because to go out and hire, you are looking at at least a 6-month learning curve but she needs the help now. And so I had to address this situation at that time by shifting people over and making sure that we can help now.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did she get the resources that she needed when she needed them?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I think, sadly enough, your chart shows that with the amount of downgrades that we had to do to make that rating, to make the ratings be appropriate--and at that particular time, I would say I was never satisfied with anything, and that typically was the budget process, is where I would go and I would request and document the need for those requests and then we would get them. But at this particular time, and knowing what I did in shifting over personnel, this particular issue, yes, this was resolved.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It was resolved. Were the resources adequate? She was warning you, the storm is coming. The ratings aren't going to hold. You are going to need to start downgrading. We need people. We need resources now. And you are telling me she got the resources that she needed? That is what your testimony is, under oath?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes. We increased our staff--as I said, I had about 100--over 115 people to 125 people at any given time.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Now take a look at Exhibit 84,\1\ if you would, the third page. This is Ernestine Warner again writing. ``In light of the current state of residential mortgage performance, especially sub-prime, I think it would be very beneficial for the RMBS surveillance team to have the work being done by the temps to continue. It is still very important that performance data is loaded on a timely basis as this has an impact on our exception reports. Currently, there are nearly 1,000 deals with data loads aged beyond one month.'' Was that satisfactory, to have that kind of a backlog? \1\ See Exhibit No. 84, which appears in the Appendix on page 526.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No, and that is what we did. Also, we used-- for data loading and data collection, I would in addition use our affiliate company--CRISIL--and have them do a lot of the data loading and data collection. The people she is talking to are people in the data group, and she is seeking additional help in loading data.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And, Ms. Barnes, you had to borrow staff for new ratings, I understand, from surveillance, is that correct?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Mr. Chairman. At different times, we shifted resources between the two.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","How about at that time, at that time that we are talking about?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","In December 2006?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I don't think so in December 2006, but in February, we were working jointly.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Jointly, but you were short of staff at the same time they were short of staff, is that correct? You were both short of staff?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, Mr. Chairman. Everyone was working very hard and----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I know everyone was working hard. Were you both short of staff?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right. As a manager, you are always asking for more resources to do more things----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This is just a routine time, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Right.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This was all routine.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","No, not at all.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","There wasn't a collapse, or a calamity that was about to hit us. It was just ordinary, bureaucratic, everyone can always use more staff. Everybody is working pretty hard. You needed more staff. You saw something coming, didn't you?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And didn't you also need more staff, and didn't you make requests for more staff? Didn't you have to pull staff from other parts of the operation?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, we did, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","February 2007, we need to talk about getting more resources in general. I see evidence that I really need to add staff to keep up what is going on with subprime and mortgage performance in general. And the company was doing well, wasn't it, pretty well profit-wise at this time, S&P at that time?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I can't speak to the financial performance.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Can you speak to that?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","No. We, as I said, had our hands full with monitoring delinquencies to see if they would lead to realized losses.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And in 2006, delinquency rates for loans supporting subprime securities were hitting record levels, is that true, Mr. D'Erchia?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","In 2006, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And they outpaced any previous year for subprime RMBSes, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","To my knowledge, yes, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And by the end of 2006, delinquencies in the high-risk subprime securities, RMBS securities, were approaching 10 percent and the vintage was not even a year old, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","The specific numbers sound correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","There were a lot of reasons for the 2006 loans that were going bad so quickly. Fraud in mortgage applications was up substantially. Low and no doc loans were prevalent. stated income loans, in which a bank doesn't verify the borrower's income, were everywhere. Combined loan-to-value was pushing 90 percent for subprime. Housing prices had peaked and were beginning to fall, making refinancing difficult. Is it correct that by late 2006, that you were of the opinion that subprime was rapidly deteriorating? Is that correct, Ms. Barnes?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I am sorry, which month?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","What time?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I am sorry, I didn't catch the last part of your----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is it correct that by late 2006, you were of the opinion that subprime was rapidly deteriorating?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","I would say it was deteriorating at a pace that was higher than the previous vintages, yes.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, I agree.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","How about you, Ms. Yoshizawa?",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","I think our RMBS group was publishing that it was higher than previous vintages, but it was still tracking with some of the previous downturn years.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. In late 2006, I believe that Standard and Poor's advised the head of structured finance was a person named Joanne Rose?",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Yes, it was, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That subprime was rapidly deteriorating and that you felt that Standard and Poor's should start downgrading subprime, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","We were downgrading subprime.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So that you felt Standard and Poor's should downgrade subprime, significantly.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","At this time period.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you continued to bring that up in 2007, is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Your charts show----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And was she resistant at all?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I wouldn't say resisted. She would want us to work more in conjunction with the deal side and others, including Frank and our research and our criteria groups, in order to ascertain whether or not we are seeing an anomaly where the delinquencies are front-end loaded, and the reality over the life of the transaction, if that became true, then we wouldn't be seeing such large losses and downgrades. When it became apparent that those losses were being realized, yes, we made those ratings appropriate.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. But you had kind of a bone of contention, was there not, between you and Joanne Rose? Isn't that a fair statement? There was a disagreement between you and Joanne Rose on this issue, was there not? I mean, people have disagreements. Was there a disagreement about this issue?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","About this issue?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. And as a matter of fact, it became such a bone of contention that she gave you a bad performance evaluation, didn't she? You had strong convictions on this subject, about the rapid deterioration of subprime mortgages and the need to downgrade, is that not true?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, but it wasn't clear to me that the evaluation was personal issues or related to this issue.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But it may have been related to this issue, is that what you are saying? It wasn't clear to you----",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","It wasn't clear to me why she wrote that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. It followed, however, some continued disagreements about the issue of the rapid deterioration of the subprime mortgages and the need to downgrade. Is that fair, that bad performance evaluation came at that time?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I guess I am not clear on what the exact question is.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You made a comment about her evaluation, I believe, is that not true----",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","My evaluation.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Of you.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","I responded.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Who evaluated you?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Who evaluated me?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was she evaluating you?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","She wrote that evaluation.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is what I am saying. And you had previously had a disagreement with her about the issue of downgrading subprime mortgages and the rapid deterioration, in your judgment, which was occurring, and she and you had a disagreement about that, and you have acknowledged that you did have a disagreement. Did you not write in your comment about her evaluation that you had a disagreement over subprime debt deterioration? Did you not write that in your reaction?",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Yes, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. The bottom line is that the credit rating agencies continued to issue AAA ratings on new subprime RMBS and CDOs in 2007 despite warnings, despite a large percentage of the 2007 vintage turning out to be problematic and downgraded, and it is a pretty sad story. A sad chapter in the history of credit rating agencies, folks. People put a lot of reliance, maybe too much reliance, on what you do, but that is a fact and it is no longer as much of a fact as it was a couple of years ago and there was a real failure here. How we deal with it, we will know in the next few weeks. There are some structural problems here in terms of conflict of interest, but there are some other issues, as well. We, I think, see some of it in the history which are in these exhibits. As much as exhibits can come to life, these problems are coming to life. I thank you all.",Speech,
"Mr. D'Erchia","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Ms. Yoshizawa","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Ms. Barnes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","We are going to recess for 10 minutes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. We will come back to order. Our third and final panel of witnesses for today's hearing is Raymond McDaniel, Jr., Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Moody's Corporation, and Kathleen A. Corbet, the former President of Standard and Poor's from 2004 to 2007. I don't know if you were with us before when we said that under Rule 6 of our Subcommittee, all of our witnesses are required to be sworn. So I would ask you both to stand, raise your right hand, and answer the following question. Do you swear that all the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I do.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I do.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you. And under our timing system, we will give you one minute notice. The light will turn from green to yellow. It will become red in 5 minutes, so we would ask that you try to limit your oral testimony to no more than 5 minutes. I know that sometimes that goes over, and if it does, it does, but we would ask you to make that effort. Mr. McDaniel, I think we will have you go first, followed by Ms. Corbet, and then we will turn to questions. Thank you both for being here today. Mr. McDaniel.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Kaufman. I am Ray McDaniel, Chairman and CEO of Moody's Corporation, the parent of the credit rating agency Moody's Investor Service. I want to thank you for the opportunity to contribute Moody's views today. \1\ The joint prepared statement of Mr. McDaniel and Ms. Yoshizawa appears in the Appendix on page 186. The global financial crisis has sparked a necessary debate about the role and performance of numerous participants in the financial markets. With respect to credit rating agencies, many market observers have expressed concerns that ratings did not better predict the deteriorating conditions in the subprime mortgage market. Let me assure you that Moody's is not satisfied, and I am not satisfied, with the performance of our ratings during the unprecedented market downturn of the past 2 years. We did not anticipate the extraordinary confluence of forces that drove the unusually poor performance of subprime mortgages. We were not alone in this regard, but I believe that we should be at the leading edge for predictive opinions about credit risk. Some key issues influencing the unanticipated performance included the steep and sudden nationwide decline in home prices and the sharp contraction that followed in credit available from banks for mortgage refinancing. Moody's did observe a trend of loosening mortgage underwriting and escalating home prices. We highlighted that trend in our reports and incorporated it into our analysis of mortgage-backed securities. And, as conditions in the U.S. housing market began to deteriorate beyond our expectations, we took the rating actions that we believed at the time were appropriate based on the information we had. Let me summarize our actions during the 2003 to 2007 time frame. First, starting in 2003, we identified and began commenting on the loosening of underwriting standards and escalating housing prices through our sector publications. Second, we tightened our ratings criteria in response to these loosening standards. In fact, between 2003 and 2006, we steadily increased our loss expectations and the levels of credit protection required for a given rating level. In practical terms, this meant that by 2006, half the mortgages in a pool would have to default and provide a recovery of just half the appraised value of the home before a subprime RMBS bond rated AAA by Moody's would suffer its first dollar of loss. This is a level of anticipated loss that far exceeded the losses that actually occurred in the past four real estate recessions. But even these conservative assumptions proved insufficient. Third, we took steps to watch and analyze the unprecedented market conditions and the behavior of various market participants as the crisis continued to unfold. For example, one question before the market was how borrowers, servicers, and banks would respond to the resetting of mortgage interest rates and how that behavior would affect default rates. Faced with extraordinary conditions, we saw market participants, including borrowers, mortgage servicers, mortgage originators, and the Federal Government, behave in historically unprecedented ways. Fourth, we took rating actions when the mortgage performance data warranted. Moody's monitors the actual performance of the mortgages and the securities that we rate throughout the life of the security. The early performance of the 2006 loans was, in fact, comparable to the performance of similar subprime loans during the 2000 and 2001 recession. And not until performance data from the second quarter of 2007 was available did it become clear that many of the 2006 vintage bonds might perform worse than those from the prior recession. In short, Moody's did see the loosening of some prime lending standards. We reported our observations to the market and we incorporated our increasingly unfavorable views into the ratings we assigned. However, let me emphasize again that we, like most other market participants, did not anticipate the severity or the speed of deterioration that occurred in the U.S. housing market, nor did we anticipate the behavior of market participants in response to the housing downturn, including the speed of credit tightening by financial institutions that followed and exacerbated the situation. The unprecedented events of the last few years provide critical lessons to all market participants, certainly including us. At Moody's over the past 2 years, we have undertaken a wide range of initiatives to strengthen the quality, transparency, and independence of our ratings. Some of these measures include establishing common macroeconomic scenarios for rating committees, publishing volatility scores and sensitivity analysis on structured finance securities, consolidating surveillance activities and structured finance under one leadership, and further bolstering the independence of and resources for our credit policy function. Moody's is firmly committed to meeting the highest standards of integrity in our rating practices. We wholeheartedly support constructive reforms and we are eager to work with Congress, regulators, and other market participants to that end. I am happy to respond to your questions.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF RAYMOND W. MCDANIEL, JR.,\1\ CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MOODY'S CORPORATION
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. McDaniel. Ms. Corbet.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Senator Kaufman. \1\ The prepared statement of Ms. Corbet appears in the Appendix on page 210. My name is Kathleen Corbet and my career spans over 25 years of experience within the financial services industry. For a 3-year period during my career, I served as President as Standard and Poor's, a division of the McGraw-Hill Companies, from April 2004 until my voluntary departure in September 2007. Before turning to the substantive issues raised by the Subcommittee's investigation, I would like to acknowledge the important work of the Subcommittee and Congress more broadly in its examination of the causes and consequences of the financial crisis. It is difficult not to feel personally touched by the pain experienced by many as a result of the turmoil in the subprime market and the financial crisis that followed. Many people feel anger, and in my view, that anger is understandable. Accordingly, I believe strongly that we should collectively use the lessons from this crisis to focus on effective reforms, stronger investor protections, better industry practices, and accountability. As background, I was recruited to join the McGraw-Hill Companies as an Executive Vice President of its Financial Services Division in April 2004 and served as President of Standard and Poor's until my successor, Deven Sharma, took over that position in September 2007. During my 3-year tenure, I led an organization of 8,000 employees based in 23 countries which provided financial information and market analysis to its customers and the broader market as a whole. The company was organized across four primary business units, including Rating Services, Equity Research Services, Index Services, and Data and Information Services. Each business unit was led by a seasoned executive having direct operating responsibility in the respective area and reporting directly to me. One of those units was Rating Services, which issued credit ratings on hundreds of thousands of securities across the globe, including corporate securities, government securities, and structured finance securities. Rating Services was led by an Executive Vice President for Ratings, an executive with over 30 years of experience in the ratings business, who had day-to- day operational responsibility for that business. Among her direct reports was the Executive Managing Director of Structured Finance Ratings, who was responsible for the day-to- day operations of the Structured Finance Ratings Group, the group that issued the ratings that are the subject of this Subcommittee's focus. Consistent with S&P's longstanding and publicly disclosed practice, ratings decisions were and are solely the province of committees comprised of experienced analysts in the relevant area. This practice is based on the principle that the highest quality analysis comes from the exercise of independent analytical judgment free from both undue external or internal pressure. Accordingly, during my tenure, I did not participate in any rating or analytical criteria committee meetings regarding ratings on any type of security, including mortgage- backed securities. All that said, I do hope to be able to provide a business perspective that is helpful to the Subcommittee, and in my view, it is clear that many of the ratings S&P issued on securities backed by subprime mortgages have performed extremely poorly. S&P has publicly stated its profound disappointment with that performance, and I deeply share that sentiment. From my personal perspective, I believe the primary reason for these downgrades is that, despite its efforts to get the rating right and despite rooting its analysis in historical data, S&P's assumptions did not capture the unprecedented and unexpected outcomes that later occurred with respect to the housing market, borrower behavior and credit correlations. S&P, along with others, has been criticized for its failure to predict what happened in the subprime market, and in many ways, that criticism is justifiable. Moreover, the subsequent outcome of the severe economic downturn and downgrades of securities backed by subprime mortgages highlight the challenges inherent in the nature of ratings. At their core, ratings are opinions about what may happen in the future, specifically, the likelihood that a particular security may default. I think that most people agree that predicting the future is always challenging and outcomes can often turn out very differently than even the most carefully derived predictions anticipate. The key from my perspective is to learn from these experiences and to take specific actions to improve. The credit rating industry has begun to respond in a constructive fashion, but there is much more to be done. Through the course of history and through many market cycles, the credit rating industry has played an important role in the financial system for nearly a century, and I do believe that it has the opportunity to continue to do so through the commitment to continual improvements and from appropriate regulatory reform. Again, I appreciate the goals of the Subcommittee's work and would be glad to answer any questions that you have.",Statement,TESTIMONY OF KATHLEEN A. CORBET,\1\ FORMER PRESIDENT (2004- 2007), STANDARD AND POOR'S
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Ms. Corbet. Thank you both. Before we start with questions, let me put into the record a statement of the Attorney General of the State of Connecticut, Richard Blumenthal. He has made a very powerful statement about the topic of the hearing today, which is ``Wall Street and the Financial Crisis: The Role of Credit Rating Agencies,'' and that will be made part of the record at an appropriate place.\1\ \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Blumenthal appears in the Appendix as Exhibit 109, on page 1201. Were you both here earlier?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes, I was.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Mr. McDaniel, were you here, too?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I was here for the second panel.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","The second panel.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Well, in that case, I may have to repeat some of the questions. The first exhibit that we have used is Exhibit 94b,\1\ where a Standard and Poor's analyst wrote--maybe, Ms. Corbet, you could take a look at Exhibit 94b--``Vertical is politically closely tied to Bank of America and is mostly a marketing shop - helping to take risk off books of Bank of America. Don't see why we have to tolerate lack of cooperation. Deals likely not to perform.'' This deal was rated by Standard and Poor's anyway, even though the analyst said that the deal was not likely to perform. \1\ See Exhibit No. 94b, which appears in the Appendix on page 599. Then the next transaction that I want to look at with you was Fremont, which is Exhibit 93b.\2\ Standard and Poor's was asked to rate an RMBS with subprime loans issued by Fremont Investment. This was a subprime lender known for poor quality loans. An email was sent by an S&P ratings analyst to his supervisor saying, ``I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral.'' He says, ``Fremont collateral has been performing not so good. Is there anything special I should be aware of?'' One supervisor says, ``No, we don't treat their collateral any differently.'' Another one says, ``if the current FICO scores are there, the answer is good to go.''\3\ \2\ See Exhibit No. 93b, which appears in the Appendix on page 589. \3\ See Exhibit No. 93c, which appears in the Appendix on page 590. Now, there was a whole lot of evidence, a whole lot of evidence beside evidence right inside of S&P that Fremont collateral was problematical, to put it mildly. Fremont had stopped using 8,000 brokers--that is Exhibit 93d\4\--due to the loans that those brokers were forwarding, which had some of the highest delinquency rates in the country. As a matter of fact, there was an exhibit where--Exhibit 93a\5\--a Moody's analyst in late December 2006, before the Fremont deal was rated, said, ``Holy cow . . . Fremont is such an outlier,'' talking about their delinquency rates being one of the worst in the country. That is Exhibit 93a at the bottom. This analyst almost couldn't believe it. ``Holy cow--is this data correct? I just graphed it and Fremont is such an outlier!!'' \4\ See Exhibit No. 93d, which appears in the Appendix on page 592. \5\ See Exhibit No. 93a, which appears in the Appendix on page 587. It was well known, publicly, inside of the credit rating agencies, that Fremont collateral was problematical. There had also been a California Court of Appeals decision described in an 8(k) filing by Fremont where there was sufficient evidence in a lawsuit by the California Insurance Commissioner talking about Fremont. There was a cease and desist order at the FDIC involving Fremont. But all we get internally here is, you are good to go. The fact that we know that they are problematical does not affect us. And I am just wondering--first, let me start with you, Ms. Corbet. Your own employees know that Fremont issued poor quality loans, high delinquency rates, and yet they handle Fremont loans the way they do any other loans. Shouldn't that kind of a history be taken into account by S&P?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, first of all, Mr. Chairman, I am not familiar with this particular transaction or the people that wrote this email or corresponded with this email. I would say, however, that in the analysis of any transaction in terms of both the quantitative analysis and qualitative model, that all factors are considered in the consideration of a rating.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Should be.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","All factors should be considered, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So that Standard and Poor's assigns lower ratings to lenders that are known for poor quality loans with high delinquency rates? Does Standard and Poor's assign lower ratings to lenders that are known for poor quality loans?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would suggest to you that in this particular case, in terms of discussing the collateral, again, this is perhaps just one piece of a larger discussion around a transaction, but I think the question was, should anything be considered about the FICO scores, and that is something that has nothing to do necessarily with, in this particular case, the provider of this transaction, and I believe that whoever this person was that was responding said that shouldn't make a difference. That is another element of data. It doesn't mean that not everything was considered. It is just that means that it shouldn't be changed in terms of treating it any differently. That would be my observations. Again, I don't know anything specific about this transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, I am asking you generically. In this transaction, you have got an analyst who says, ``I have a Goldman deal with subprime Fremont collateral. Since Fremont collateral has been performing not so good, is there anything special I should be aware of?'' Answer, ``we don't treat their collateral any differently.'' My question, when you got Fremont, which has been not only publicly, but now internally an analyst says Fremont collateral has not been performing good, was that the right answer, don't treat their collateral any differently?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not sure what they were referring to, whether they are treating it in a model, whether they are considering it in any other context, so I couldn't say----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is that the right answer?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Again, I think it is----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is the whole answer. Ms. Corbet . In a small context. It is not clear whether he is suggesting that it should be different in any other kind of model. It is the underlying collateral that I think he is referring to.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Should the collateral be treated differently where the collateral is coming from a company that is not performing so good?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Again, in the context of all the different variables that need to be considered, I could not comment as to whether or not the particular query that he is asking about----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, I am asking you a generic question. Should collateral that is coming from a company whose collateral in general is not performing so good, should that collateral be treated differently?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I think that certainly should be taken into consideration.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It wasn't here. That is all I can tell you. It is your company, and I don't know if anyone cares to do anything about it when you get that kind of an answer, but I would think that the message ought to go from the leadership of an agency--that is something which should be looked at, not, it doesn't make any difference. The answer is here from a supervisor, it doesn't make any difference that their collateral is not performing well.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You just said finally, after the fourth time I asked, it should be looked at differently.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","And it doesn't mean that it wasn't.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You don't know that it wasn't. I don't know that it wasn't.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I don't----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All we know is what the response was, and you are saying it was the wrong response. It should be a factor in how it is treated, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","And it very well might have been.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I am not asking you whether it might have been or was. It got a AAA rating. My question is, should it be treated differently?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would expect it would be considered----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And should?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would expect that it would be considered, yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And would you believe it should be considered differently?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would expect that all of the different provisions of the transaction should be considered, yes, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you. Now let me ask you, Mr. McDaniel, does Moody's assign lower ratings to lenders that are known for poor quality loans with high delinquency rates?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Do you mean to the lenders themselves?",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, to the loans of those lenders.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Clearly, pools of lower-quality loans versus higher-quality loans is a credit factor, absolutely.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, I am not asking you that. I am asking you whether or not you assign a lower rating if you know that the lender involved is known for poor quality loans with high delinquency rates. Is that something you look at when you rate their loans?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","It absolutely is something we look at, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Senator Kaufman.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you very much. Just so I get it clear, it is in your statements, I mean, but just to kind of concentrate on what it is, we know that thousands of RMBSes that were rated AAA in 2006-2007 are now rated as junk. Mr. McDaniel, what would you give precisely as what you think are the main reasons why that happened?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I think there were a number of reasons. Among the principal or the most proximate reasons would be that we went from a period where there was a long period of home price appreciation. There was low interest rates and low credit spreads so that there was a lot of credit availability. We had the introduction of--when we had the introduction of a softening in the housing market, the loose credit that had been available tightened very rapidly and that curtailed refinancing opportunities for many borrowers who were anticipating that they were going to be able to refinance their mortgages.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Ms. Corbet.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would concur with all of that statement. Indeed, it was predicting what the likely outcome would be, not only in terms of the housing market, but also unemployment, borrower behavior, also credit correlations. All of those in terms of the forecast were certainly not as great as the outcome that actually transpired.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","So essentially it was the housing market. I mean, it was the housing market, all the things that were happening----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","It was the confluence, many factors---- Senator Kaufman . The meltdown of all the things.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. McDaniel, is that----",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","That was it.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. McDaniel, as you said in your testimony, and as you mentioned here earlier, as early as 2003, you were talking about the housing market. You were saying that the housing market--on page 18 of your testimony. So you knew as early as 2003 this was going to be a problem. This just didn't come on you in 2006 and 2007 like I think sometimes it is characterized by certain people, as kind of like a natural disaster. It was like a volcano or a hurricane. This housing thing happened, and you have just got to understand when things like that happen. We had years and years and this never happened before. Therefore--I mean, this is a constant theme we are hearing in these hearings. But as early as 2003, you knew the housing market was a problem and you lay out what your concerns are. So you are now at 2006 and 2007, and I understand you have tightened your standards, but when it is all over, an incredible number of these thousands--they said something like 10,000 RMBSes from 2002 to 2007, the majority of AAA ratings are now rated as junk. How does that happen?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","First, Senator, we did not identify a housing bubble in 2003. We certainly----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No. I mean you saw the oncoming.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes, we saw loosening underwriting standards----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. McDaniel . And we were certainly aware that home price appreciation was occurring through this period.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","So, it is hard--Ms. Corbet, I will get back to it and maybe the two of you can work together. There is the chart. Oh, that bubble just came on. Look, I am not saying we are all victims of our own personal experience. In 2005, I sent my children a printout from Merrill Lynch of essentially that chart, and I sent with them what Merrill Lynch said. People say that this is because there are so many more people buying houses, but if that was true, they showed another chart and it showed then rental use would go up, too, and rental use was rock solid. So we have a housing bubble. That is what Merrill Lynch sent out to me as a Merrill Lynch investor and I sent it to my kids. The fact that we were coming onto a bubble, as you say, you didn't say it in 2003, but you are talking about it generally and you are still--do you see my point? These products are still rolling off the assembly lines with AAA on them.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","That is exactly why we were raising the credit protection levels associated with the highly-rated securities. I acknowledge they proved to be insufficient upward adjustments in credit protection. Those adjustments were overwhelmed by the actual performance of the mortgages that were created in the 2006-2007 period.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Ms. Corbet, does that agree with some of your position?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes. In fact, Standard and Poor's was reporting on what they saw was the increasing risks of the housing bubble, and throughout the course of 2004, 2005, through 2007, those analyses and research vis-a-vis publications and teleconferences were provided to the market, as well as what the expected impact might be on subprime mortgages.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","But you must admit, and I understand and I have understood for a long time that what most people think is AAA and most people think is what you do is not what you do, but it is fair to say that if you are sending out all kinds of advisories and putting all kinds of prints, but the AAAs are still rolling off the assembly line, that is really what affects investors, right? I mean, we have a problem here, but by the way, I am just going to send another group of AAAs down the old pike. And the argument is kind of like, well, historically, we really did well. This never happened before. But you had to have some kind of seeing that there is a dark cloud on the horizon, and you didn't see those in the corporation. You get up every day kind of thinking about it. How am I going to make this work? How am I going to protect my brand? How am I going to make money? How am I going to make all this work? And, Ms. Corbet, I know you don't take any part in doing the ratings, but was there any--I mean, did either of you feel a little bit uncomfortable? Did you get up in the morning and say, we are still rating these things AAA and it doesn't look good, Mr. McDaniel? Let me put it this way, when did it hit you that maybe we ought to really take a hard look at what we are rating AAA, not what we are sending out, not that we are setting up credit backup, but what we are actually--RMBSes that we are rating AAA? About when did you start feeling, there is a problem here and I am the CEO. I am going to have to address that.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We endeavor to take a hard look at everything we rate----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, but, I mean---- Mr. McDaniel . Regardless of the rating level--",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, I know, but there are some---- Mr. McDaniel . Including AAA.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","But somewhere in here, there was a point at which you did something differently, didn't you? Or did this just kind of peter out on its own? Was there any modification of behavior as you--did you ever go to any of the people on your board or people that were working for you and say, look, this is a bad situation. We ought to start doing something a little different than what we did yesterday.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We certainly were aggressively monitoring the market and looking at the performance of mortgages and associating that performance with the credit protection levels in these deals. If you are asking what was probably the most important point in time, at least for me----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. Mr. McDaniel . It was when we saw that the delinquency and default trends for the mortgages originated in 2006 departed from the delinquency and default trends that we had seen in prior recessions, most recently the 2000-2001.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And when would you think that was?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","That was in the second quarter of 2007. Until then, they had been tracking almost identically to the default and delinquency trends we saw in the previous recession, and we knew that the transactions had more than sufficient credit protection to withstand that kind of a downturn.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","So if I went back and looked, the number of AAAs rolling out the door as a percentage after the first quarter of 2007 would have begun to change?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","The credit protection levels were raised, and then the market shut down very quickly after that.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Ms. Corbet, when did you first pull your management team together and say, I don't think this is like what has happened in the past. We are producing products--way too many of our AAAs are defaulting. We should really change the way things are going.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, I think Standard and Poor's, concurrent with its own research and publications of some of the stresses that they were beginning to see in the marketplace back in 2005, they began to make, as earlier testified by the S&P folks, that they began to make changes in their criteria and their credit enhancement levels in 2005 and in 2006, as well. In fact, in 2006, the number of downgrades exceeded the number of upgrades for subprime residential mortgage-backed securities. So the actions were following the research and the findings that were being reported to the marketplace. In 2007, following again the two previous credit enhancement increases, again, the performance data was suggesting that it was even more serious than was previously contemplated, and so, therefore, in February 2007 S&P made another change and announcement of downgrades to--credit watch, excuse me, for subprime mortgages. In March, we reported also in a teleconference about what our outlook was in terms of expectations for the housing market and what the impact may be in terms of downgrades----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And again, this reporting is great, but really, the key----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Is actions, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. But, I mean, the key is how many AAAs are we sending out the door that in retrospect, when you look back on it 2 years later, are not AAA but they are junk? I mean, that is really the key. I think--and, Ms. Corbet, were you here for the first panel?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I was in and out, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. That is not what they said in the first panel. They said a number of things, and what I would like to do is kind of go through them and see what you say. They said it was incentives.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. McDaniel, they said that there were incentives in the organization, in Moody's, to get more business out the door, to not worry so much about what the rating is going to be, just move it out there, quantity over quality, I think, is the term that one of the gentlemen used. Clearly, you haven't raised that as one of the problems.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Ratings quality is paramount at Moody's. It has been, I think, throughout our history and it continues to be. We rate according to published methodologies. Our thinking is as transparent as we can make it, to provide the market the opportunity to----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","So, basically, you just think that there was no incentive problem inside Moody's, that essentially everything went just exactly as you just said. This is an operation that was smoothly functioning and there was no--the incentives--to the extent there were incentives for people to do things other than what you said, to take a cold eye view at everything, you just didn't see it and you had no reports of anyone in your organization saying, maybe we are incentivizing people to maybe move the process a little bit one way or the other.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We have many business objectives at the firm. None of those objectives are permitted to compromise ratings quality. People actively talk about whether our protocols and procedures are sufficient, whether they are best practice, should they be changed, and if they can be and we can improve ourselves, we do.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. So I am just saying, in terms of what these four gentlemen were up here saying uniformly is something that you didn't hear about at the time, don't see it being a problem in terms of incentives, and that, essentially, everything was working smoothly from your view as CEO?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I was not aware of any incentives being misaligned----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","When you talked about incentives in business meetings, did you ever say, look, we had better be careful that we don't create too many incentives for market share and profits, that maybe someone down in the organization might get the wrong message and begin to kind of--especially when you had the explosion of business that you had during this period? Can you put the chart up that shows how much business grew?\1\ I mean, this was literally an explosion of business. And what they said was, this was a market. This is great. Look at this. \1\ See Exhibit No. 1g, which appears in the Appendix on page 242.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Well----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","That usually happens in every business organization I have been involved in, management comes to me and says--let us get it out the door. Let us watch our profit line. Let us get this business. Let us be competitive. There were stories about market share where managers were in trouble if their market share dropped, and when they checked on why the market share dropped, the person said, look, these were just bad loans. We didn't do them. And the manager came back and said, well, look, other people are doing it. You have dropped three points. We can't have that. Do you believe any of that went on at Moody's?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I have been with Moody's 23 years. I am unaware of any employee at Moody's ever being removed or terminated for a market share----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Or how about just basically said, get with the program?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As I said, we are interested in----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","What would you attribute the incredible growth during this period to, great management practices?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","The growth in the debt markets.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","That is what I attribute that growth to.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Ms. Corbet, in S&P, did you----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","In S&P, certainly the growth in the credit markets, but also in the three other businesses that S&P is involved in. The index services business is a very large and growing business with indices and ETFs, the data and information business, and, as well as equity research, and all four contributed to the growth at S&P.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. McDaniel, I am not asking about this specific email because it was a long time ago, it was October 2007, but it says, analysts--this is from Moody's Chief Risk Officer--``Analysts and managing directors are continually pitched by bankers, issues, and investors, all with reasonable arguments. These views can color credit management judgments, sometimes improving it, other times degrading it. We call it, drinking the Kool-Aid. Coupled with strong--and this is a market share, market focus--this does constitute a risk to ratings quality.''\1\ \1\ See Exhibit No. 24b, which appears in the Appendix on page 319. And I am not asking you about this specific thing, but you still say that you never had any feelings in the organization that the incentives and desire for short-term profits had any impact on your ratings?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I am aware of the passage that you just read and the author of that passage was talking about the fact that we are gathering information from many different sources in the marketplace, issuers, investors----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. Mr. McDaniel . Bankers, all with point of view----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. McDaniel . And that runs the risk of having our thinking match the consensus thinking in the marketplace--",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. McDaniel . And that the strength of the work that we do is to have independent points of view.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. No, I got that. And, Ms. Corbet, I didn't get a chance for you to answer the question. When you were CEO of Standard and Poor's, did you ever run into someone coming to you and saying, I feel under pressure to do some things, maybe in order to build business, in order to increase profitability? Never once, right?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","No.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","OK. One of the men on the first panel who had been there for a number of years said the whole time he is worried, aren't they going to see that they are destroying our brand? Aren't they seeing by doing these short-term things we are destroying our brand? Mr. McDaniel, you never felt any problem during this period that what was going on--clearly, since you don't think anything was going to hurt the Moody's brand.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","The ability to run a successful business in the credit ratings industry is first and foremost dependent on having predictive ratings. And so business success is very tightly aligned with the quality of the ratings, which is----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","That is the point he was making. He is saying that our whole business depends on this.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","And that is why the performance of the subprime mortgage securities, particularly in 2006 and 2007, is so frustrating to me as a CEO, among other reasons.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Well, I don't see why it would be frustrating, because basically, what happened was we had this housing market blow-up, and through no fault of our own, everything went south. There was nothing--you have not identified a single thing that was going on at Moody's other than just you guys got caught in a bad housing market, not in a bad business market, a bad housing market.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","There are a number of things that, in hindsight, I wish we had done differently, absolutely.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","That is really what I was trying to get at with the first question. What are some of the things that, in hindsight, you would have done differently?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","There are a number. I think at the macro level, we were insufficiently rigorous in thinking about trends in housing at an overall system level, and even more importantly, having thought about that, pushing that macroeconomic, macro housing perspective down into the rating committee deliberations.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","How would you have done that? I mean, the system that you have laid out was, as Ms. Corbet even said--I didn't have anything to do with this rating thing. I think your testimony is essentially--how would you have done that? How would you have, in this system, been able to communicate down and you say, look, we are not being rigorous enough in this analysis? What would you do mechanically? Would you send a memo to everybody and say, while we are doing this thing, let us take a look at these?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","What we are doing now is a formal macro risk perspective series. It is updated every 6 months. This is done on a global basis. And we are taking the relevant components of that macro risk perspective and the stress scenarios around that and delivering those to--not only to our own employees, but to the marketplace, as well, and instructing the managers and rating analysts that they should utilize the relevant parts of that macro analysis. We are also using, particularly in the mortgage sector, we are relying much more heavily on work done by a company that we purchased back in, I think it was late 2005, perhaps early 2006, Moody'seconomy.com, which provides housing analysis nationwide, housing demographic and econometric analysis.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Is there anything else just short, any other thing you think in retrospect----",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes. As I said, there are a number of things.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","In addition, we determined that we had to have more cross-disciplinary expertise in the rating committees, that there are other elements operating in the credit markets that may affect housing, that bringing different disciplines to bear in the rating really brings a richer perspective. We have changed governance practices in the ratings business. We have changed our methodologies and our enhancements. We have added different types of research to try and communicate our views as clearly as possible. There is a very long list and I am trying to hit on----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","I have got it. No, that is not good enough. Ms. Corbet, is there anything in retrospect that you would have done differently?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, similarly to Moody's, Standard and Poor's has taken increased steps in terms of governance, in terms of including in their forecasts and ratings elements of stability, the stability of ratings, the comparability of ratings----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","How about have you thought at all about the way you incentivize people within the organization? Has that been a concern at all?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, historically, and I believe that is the case today, that analysts have never been incentivized based on----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","No, I am not talking about analysts. I am talking about people from top to bottom in the organization, the business part of the organization.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","At Standard and Poor's throughout--certainly during my tenure--it has always been about the analytical quality and independence of the ratings being first and foremost and not being compromised.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. I am sorry you didn't hear the first panel because it was pretty unanimous that it stopped at some point and moved to a situation where the business part of--and by the way, just so you don't feel bad, the hearing we had last week, Washington Mutual, exactly the same discussion went on, is it fair to say, that people that were involved in it feel that the incentives were such and the disincentives were such within the organization that things were done that they wish they hadn't done, that quality was overlooked, that it was more about quantity than quality. So it is not just at Standard and Poor's and Moody's, and I am sure we are going to find, from everything I can see, it has happened in loads and loads of organizations. Things are going great. Let us do it. We know what we are doing. Let us just get the stuff out the door. So anyway, I am just saying, it is of concern, that also at Washington Mutual, the head of Washington Mutual had no idea this was going on while many people in the organization felt that was going on, so----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, to the extent that was, and again----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And I am going to ask you to comment later. Ms. Corbet . I think that it is important that, and certainly was the case, I believe, at S&P, is that they should have had the ability to raise those concerns with their management team----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. Ms. Corbet . And hopefully those would have been addressed if those were----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes, I know, and they did and they weren't. A lot of people think it is CEO pay that makes Americans so upset. I have my own opinion that the CEO pay thing is. The average pay of a CEO as compared to the average working person has grown quite exponentially, and I know people are concerned about that. But I think it is more that when these things happen. I mean, the idea that one of the smartest people I ever met, Robert Rubin--one of the smartest people I ever met, I am not overstating that, smart from a standpoint of knowledge, smart in terms of politics, smart in everything else--is making $30 million a year as the Vice Chairman of Citigroup and says, I didn't know there was this $49 billion bomb down in the bottom of my business. I mean, that is what I think people are really upset about. They are upset about the pay, but then they are upset that when these things are going on and when things are going on down in their business, as these four--and they seem to me dedicated employees, they are not disgruntled employees. They said it almost like they were as upset as anyone else. And I know the companies I worked at, people would have been upset if they felt like the brand was being hurt, because people live it. But do either one of you want to comment a little bit on barbelling, the idea that FICO scores--that the way that you calculated FICO scores and used averages allowed ne'er-do-wells to kind of pick mortgages so that they could take advantage of the averages? Are you familiar with barbelling?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As far as barbelling by taking strong and weak FICO scores----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. McDaniel . And averaging those out, we do not look at FICO scores on an average basis, so that barbelling, I don't----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And you never have?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I don't believe so, so I don't think that would have achieved what someone might have wanted to achieve.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And, Ms. Corbet, do you----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am unfamiliar with the term.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Unfamiliar with the term. How about stated income loans? Mr. McDaniel, you are familiar with what a stated income loan is, aren't you?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","And, Ms. Corbet, are you familiar with stated income loans?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Did you feel at any point there was like an explosion of stated income loans throughout the business? With the explosion of the business went the explosion of stated income loans, and from the data we have, there are many companies that were going--it started out as just a small part of the business and becoming more. At any point, did you get concerned or would you be concerned, or is that part of the calculation of the ratings, that there were a lot of stated income loans in a particular security?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes, that would absolutely be a credit factor for an analyst or rating committee to consider.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Do you know if any was, if it was?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I have not participated in the rating committees----",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. McDaniel . But I would be extremely surprised if they hadn't.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Ms. Corbet.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would expect the same.",Speech,
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. OK. Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Thank you so much, Senator Kaufman. I think it is all well and good to look back and figure out what we would have done differently if we had known. Part of the responsibility is to look at what happened at the time. When we look at what happened at the time, we see the huge impact on the drive for market share on these companies, and there is just no getting away from it. The testimony this morning was very powerful about it. Just take a look at a few of the exhibits, Exhibit 3,\1\ first, in your book, if you would. It is August 17, 2004, importance, high. ``Rich, We are meeting with your group this week to discuss adjusting criteria for rating CDOs of real estate assets this week because of the ongoing threat of losing deals.'' Now, that is a Standard and Poor's exhibit, August 2004, an ``ongoing threat of losing deals.'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 3, which appears in the Appendix on page 250. Then you look at the next exhibit, Exhibit 2.\2\ This is Standard and Poor's, as well. ``We just lost a huge . . . RMBS deal to Moody's due to a huge difference in the required credit support level.'' Down a paragraph, ``Losing one or even several deals due to criteria issues, but this is so significant that it could have an impact in future deals. There's no way we can get back on this one but we need to address this now in preparation for future deals.'' That is Exhibit 2. \2\ See Exhibit No. 2, which appears in the Appendix on page 249. Then you look at Exhibit 5,\3\ the new S&P ratings model could have been released months ago, which is called Version 6.0, and ``resources assigned elsewhere if we didn't have to massage the sub-prime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Preserve market share. We could have done the right thing, in other words, months ago if we didn't have to massage the subprime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share. This is contemporaneous. This isn't looking back. This isn't looking in the rearview mirror. This isn't benefit of hindsight. This is what is going on at the time. \3\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258. Then you look at the testimony of Mr. Michalek this morning, a former analyst at Moody's, pretty compelling testimony. He testifies that the President of Moody's and the former head of Structured Finance, Brian Clarkson, who he believed was leading a change in culture at Moody's away from the more analytical environment to a profit-driven one, more to their customer, the investment bank, instead of the real customer, the investing public, but nonetheless what he says is that a number of bankers complained to Mr. Clarkson that Mr. Michalek was asking too many questions, doing too thorough a review. They wanted him removed from their deals, and they got their wish on future deals. Instead of rewarding Mr. Michalek for asking the probing questions and doing his job, he testified that Mr. Clarkson suggested that he provide an explanation for what he was doing and he ultimately was then not allowed to work on deals with certain banks. That message is a pretty clear message to employees. It is contemporaneous. It is at the time. Then you have another exhibit, Exhibit 11,\1\ email, May 2006. A UBS banker writes to S&P, ``heard you guys are revising your residential  rating methodology - getting very punitive on silent seconds. eard your ratings could be 5 notches back . . . onna to kill your . ay force us to do moodyfitch only cdos!'' So, an S&P employee forwards the email to a colleague and he says, ``Any truth to this?'' The colleague responds, ``We put out some criteria changes a couple of weeks ago that we will begin to use for deals closing in July. . . . We certainly did not intend to do anything to bump us off a significant amount of deals.'' God forbid we do something which bumps us off a significant amount of deals. \1\ See Exhibit No. 11, which appears in the Appendix on page 287. So, you want to look backwards, and we all do. When mistakes are made, we all love to just say, let us look forward. Don't look in the rearview mirror. But folks, there was huge pressure, according to these documents and testimony, to preserve market share contemporaneously at the time this happened. And one of the reasons according to testimony and according to the exhibits that there was not downgrading of existing RMBSes and CDOs, despite existing delinquencies, was you have got to hold on to market share. Analysts didn't have the data or the resources needed to do the volume of high-risk deals that they were asked to rate. You guys were making a lot of money. They didn't have enough resources. Investment bankers had excessive influence. Why? You needed their business. Now, I want to give some other testimony. The manager of the CDOs, a guy named Gus Harris, used to tell staff that if they lose market share, they are going to be fired. And we have that testimony, contemporaneous testimony. Were you troubled by it when you heard it? I don't know if you heard it all.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As I said, no employee at Moody's has ever been fired for market share issues, ever.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Have they been threatened that they would be fired?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Not that I am aware of.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is there any evidence that market share drove ratings? Have you seen it? Have you looked at these exhibits? Have you listened to what I just told you?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As I testified earlier, ratings quality is paramount.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Of course. It is supposed to be paramount.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We look at other things that are relevant to running a business. That includes market share, and in particular in ratings includes market coverage, whether we are paid for that coverage or not because we are operating a system in which the comparative elements are important. So being able to compare one security to another with a common view of credit or a common language for credit as expressed in the rating, I do think is important. That is different from market share for financial purposes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Ms. Corbet, are you surprised to hear testimony and exhibits about the impact of market share at the time?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, also, let me say, Mr. Chairman, that indeed, one of the things that Standard and Poor's, I think early on, recognized, that to mitigate any pressure if it came from externally, as some of the emails indicated, was really to separate the commercial from the analytical process, and so I think that was important in terms of--and exists today in terms of there is separation of the business from the ratings. Market share in many different ways can be a measure of the market's acceptance of the quality of the ratings, and so to the extent that market share declined, it could be many different things that would be looked into in terms of whether or not--and first and foremost, in any respect, that the quality of the ratings was in any way not useful to the marketplace.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","If you look at Exhibit 24a,\1\ this is a Moody's exhibit. This is the one we talked about before. ``Market share by deal count dropped to 94%.'' Any lower-- ``It's lower than the 98+% in prior quarters. Any reason for concern . . .?'' \1\ See Exhibit No. 24a, which appears in the Appendix on page 318. And then you have this Exhibit 24b.\2\ If you look at that, Mr. McDaniel, I think that exhibit was put together by your Chief Credit Officer, is that correct, Mr. Kimball? \2\ See Exhibit No. 24b, which appears in the Appendix on page 319.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes. That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","He says that--he disputes that quality is king. He says it is at risk due to pressure from bankers. ``Analysts and managing directors are continually `pitched' by bankers, issuers, investors--all with reasonable arguments-- whose views can color credit judgment, sometimes improving it, other times degrading it. (we drink the `kool-aid'). Coupled with strong internal emphasis on market share & margin focus, this does constitute a `risk' to ratings quality.'' That is his analysis. And then he says--I don't know if you followed what I was reading on page two, ``Analysts and MDs are continually pitched by bankers, issuers, investors.'' Continually pitched. This constitutes ``a risk to ratings quality.'' Do you agree with that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As I had commented before, the observation that our information sources oftentimes have points of view, whether it is issuers or investors, they have the risk of causing us to think on a consensus basis with the market and we want to have independent views. So I appreciate that Chief Credit Officer is thinking about these issues. I appreciate that he is raising them to my attention. And I have reacted by implementing many of the recommendations and thoughts that are included in his comments.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","When you say, you shouldn't operate from consensus, it says that there is a strong internal emphasis on market share.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes. That is--as I said, we have market coverage.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And that constitutes a risk to ratings quality. Does your emphasis on market share constitute a risk to ratings quality?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","If we are not attentive----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is what he is saying. He says it is coupled with an emphasis.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","He is saying----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","He is not saying if. He is saying, coupled with an emphasis. ``With a strong internal emphasis on market share . . . this does constitute a risk to ratings quality.'' That is him.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Those are risks and they must be managed properly so that the rating system is not compromised in any way.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It says it is coupled with a strong internal emphasis, and you are saying that there is no such coupling?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I am saying that is a risk and it must be managed properly so that the ratings are not compromised.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You say there is a strong internal emphasis, then, on market share? You agree to that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I pay attention to market share----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","I know you pay attention to it, but do you agree there is a strong internal emphasis on market share?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I believe he thinks there is----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you agree with him when you read that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I believe that attention to market share is one thing we must pay attention to in running the business.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, that is not my question.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","It is not as important as ratings quality, but I pay attention to it and I care about it.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But that wasn't my question.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I apologize, Mr. Chairman, I am trying to answer----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, let me try again. Was he right that there is a strong internal emphasis on market share?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","There is a strong internal emphasis on market coverage, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So you would not word it the way he does?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I would not, but I understand that market coverage and market share can be conflated.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Can be what?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Conflated.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Does that mean confused?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No, used interchangeably.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But you would not phrase it that way?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No. As I said, I think the market coverage issue is the more important issue.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did he prepare this at your request?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I actually don't remember if he prepared it at my request or independently, but I do remember receiving it.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Ms. Corbet, were you familiar with an FBI report that came out in 2004 that said that mortgage fraud was becoming more prevalent?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not specifically aware of that particular report.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware that the FBI in 2006 reported that the number of suspicious activity reports surrounding mortgage fraud rose by 700 percent?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Again, I am not familiar with that specific report.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And in the period 2004 to 2006, were you aware of the growth of interest-only loans, the broad use of interest-only loans? Do you know what I mean by interest-only loans?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I believe so, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware that there was a large use of interest-only loans during that period?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I don't know that I was aware of the amount, but I was aware that there were different types of loans being offered in the marketplace, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware that there was a large growth in the utilization of interest-only loans during that period?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not aware of what percentage of growth. I was aware that those loans existed.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware that there was a large growth? I am not asking you for a percentage. Were you aware?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes. I was aware that those were new products in the marketplace, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware in 2004 to 2006 of the growing use of no doc and low doc loans?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am aware of that, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Do you know what silent seconds are?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Honestly, I do not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is OK. I didn't know a few months ago, either. Were you aware of the second liens? Do you know what second liens are?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am familiar with the term----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Second mortgages?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This is Standard and Poor's, an email--this is Exhibit 14\1\--from Richard Koch to Michael Gutierrez. Do you know who those folks are or were? \1\ See Exhibit No. 14, which appears in the Appendix on page 293.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","No, I don't.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. That email says, ``here has been a rampant appraisal and underwriting fraud in the industry for quite some time as pressure has mounted to feed the origination machine.'' Would you agree that there was great pressure to feed the origination machine?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not aware of this specific email----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","No, I know that, but in general, were you aware that there was a huge demand for mortgages, to securitize mortgages?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I was certainly aware of the growth in securitized mortgages, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And the great demand for mortgages for that purpose?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","And the demand from investors to invest in those securities, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And from Wall Street to securitize----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You were aware of that?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware of this Exhibit 5?\1\ I don't know if I asked you specifically or not, Ms. Corbet. ``Version 6.0 could've been released months ago and . . . assigned''--I don't know if I asked you specifically about that--if they ``didn't have to massage the subprime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share.'' Did I ask you what your reaction is to that? \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 258.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","You did not ask, but I can say----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","What is your reaction?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not familiar with what the topic that they are referring to or the people who they are addressing.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","What is your reaction now that you read that, that something that would have been done otherwise could not be done because the writer, a Standard and Poor's employee, had to ``massage the subprime and Alt-A numbers to preserve market share?'' What is your reaction now that you read that?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, it is certainly troubling, but to the extent--again, it is probably--in the larger context, I am not sure what the subject might be addressing. But to the extent that was a concern, I would expect that would be reviewed, and to the extent it wasn't addressed, it should have been raised to my attention.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 87\2\ is the subject we talked about with an earlier panel. There was a message from Ms. Warner in Exhibit 87 pleading for resources. They are short-staffed, analyzed, overwhelmed. That is Exhibit 91.\3\ There are a number of exhibits that show the overwhelming shortage of staff, both to do the ratings, but also to do the reviews. Were you aware of that kind of shortfall of staff at that time? \2\ See Exhibit No. 87, which appears in the Appendix on page 535. \3\ See Exhibit No. 91, which appears in the Appendix on page 541.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Well, certainly in early 2007, as the number of securities were, again, starting to show deteriorating performance data, that indeed, the number of employees needed for this particular group needed to be increased. As I understand from Mr. D'Erchia's testimony, this group did receive the needed resources.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, that is not the part of the testimony he finally acknowledged, which is they were short of resources and didn't get what they requested. He tried to say that they shuffled back and forth, but they were short of resources. Exhibit 90, Mr. McDaniel, take a look at Exhibit 90.\4\ This is a document from a Moody's employee, January 2006. ``. . . I think we need full functionality with M3''--that is the Moody's model--``first, especially if we're to remain short- staffed for yet another year.'' Were you short-staffed in January 2006? \4\ See Exhibit No. 90, which appears in the Appendix on page 539.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you aware of that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We had stress on our resources in this period, absolutely.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you were making pretty good profit at that time, though, weren't you?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We were profitable, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And take a look at Exhibit 91, another Moody's employee in May 2007, if you would, Mr. McDaniel. The second paragraph. ``Our analysts are overwhelmed.'' This is Mr. Kolchinsky's email.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","As I remarked, there were definitely resource stresses at this point in time. People were working longer hours than we wanted them to, working more days of the week than we wanted them to. It was not for lack of having open positions, but with the pace at which the market was growing, it was difficult to fill positions as quickly as we would have liked.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did Moody's reevaluate wholesale or just certain transactions?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We monitor in our surveillance all transactions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","But did you reevaluate, for instance, an entire CDO or an entire RMBS?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I apologize. I am not following----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. If you have a new metric, you have got a new model that you are using to rate new securities, will you go back and use that model on existing securities?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","It would depend.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You didn't retest the old deals, did you?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","In many cases, we do. In other cases, we do not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And what about Standard and Poor's?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","There are two different processes once a security was issued. The surveillance group was looking at actual loan performance data to determine whether or not there would be any impact to the rating.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And you didn't go and take a look at the entire rating for an entire issue?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Every issue was looked at for--in terms of the actual performance data.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So you went back and used the new model, or did you grandfather the old rating? Which one?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","It was a different procedure for existing transactions, to look at actual performance data. And to the extent that criteria was changed on new issues, it would always be disclosed to the marketplace as to what extent any past transactions needed any criteria change or modification.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So you didn't retest your old deals. You just disclosed the new rating to the marketplace?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","We disclosed the new criteria and how it would impact securities that were to be rated going forward, that is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","In the future, going forward.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Is one of the reasons that you didn't go back and apply your new model, what you now knew, to the old deals was because of a shortage of resources to do that?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was that one of the reasons that you didn't do that, Mr. McDaniel? When you didn't do that, was that shortage of resources?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","There are a number of reasons not to go back----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Was that one of them?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I don't believe it would be.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. This is Exhibit 62.\1\ This is a Standard and Poor's exhibit. It is at the bottom of page one. ``How do we handle existing deals especially if there are material changes that can cause existing ratings to change?'' And if you look at the top of page two, again, this is Standard and Poor's, it says, ``I do not know of a situation where there were wholesale changes to existing ratings when the primary group changed assumptions or even instituted new criteria. The two major reasons why we have taken this approach is, (i) lack of sufficient personnel resources.'' Are you familiar with that document, Ms. Corbet? \1\ See Exhibit No. 62, which appears in the Appendix on page 471.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","No, I am not. This is the first--I just reviewed it this week.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. But this is not accurate This is not true? You said that----",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","This is not my understanding of how securities were surveiled.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. And then if you take a look at Exhibit 92a,\2\ Mr. McDaniel. \2\ See Exhibit No. 92a, which appears in the Appendix on page 543.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This is a focus group associate survey. If you take a look at page three, you apparently were there at a series of interviews and focus groups. If you look at that first dot. And if you look at the findings, most indicated that SFG business objectives included increasing market share and/or coverage. Do you see that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Now, after your mass downgrades in 2007, during the last 6 months, Moody's rated about 500 subprime RMBS securities and S&P rated over 700. So you are still allowing these dubious mortgages to be put into the market. Hadn't you already decided that these securities were high-risk in July? Hadn't you already reached that conclusion?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I don't believe there were new RMBS transactions in late 2007----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","You don't? In the last 6 months?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Not that I recall.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I actually departed S&P at the beginning of September, so I am not familiar what the last 6 months of transactions were.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Well, Moody's did rate RMBS----",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","OK. I apologize. I did not recall that.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","And in July, I guess, there was that massive downgrade of securities. Were you consulted when that happened?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I was aware of the downgrade, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Were you consulted?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I was not consulted from a credit perspective in terms of whether it should happen or not. I was informed so that I would have an understanding of the action the rating committees were taking.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. But it was not your job to be part of that decision?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you see the impact of those downgrades, those mass downgrades, on the market? Were you aware of the huge impact it had on the market when it happened?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We were observing deterioration in performance of mortgages. That is what had the impact on the market, I believe----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Yes. The subprime market just collapsed, right.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","And we were recognizing the deterioration with the rating downgrades, not causing the deterioration.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, if you would have done them a year earlier when you had information that the market was going under and was in trouble, if you would have done that over the year period and taken those early warning signs seriously and done your downgrading then, there wouldn't have been such a mass downgrading a year later. That is the whole issue that we are looking at. I am sure you won't agree with that, but it is, nonetheless, factually the case, that you had the information, you were applying the new model to new securities that you were rating. You did not re-rate the old securities, according to one of the documents, because you didn't want to apply the resources to do it and some other reasons. In any event, you didn't do it. And as a result, you did it in a massive way and it had a huge effect. If you would have done it in a different way when you first got the information and first had those storm warnings, I think the argument, which is much more persuasive at that point, is that you would not have had this massive downgrading which had such a huge impact in July 2007. And again, I am happy to have your comment on that, if you want, but I don't think you will probably want to agree with that. Maybe you do want to agree with it.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","We were managing the ratings system to react to actual performance data, and when it deviated from what we had seen in the previous recessions, that is when we took our actions.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","In July 2007, did you know who David Goldstein was?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No, I didn't.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Do you know who Dania Corledo was?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","How about David Oman?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No. I am sorry.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","That is OK. How about David Bawden?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. Ms. Corbet, take a look at Exhibit 52c,\1\ if you would. This is an email dated March 20, 2007. This is an S&P employee who writes that, ``In a meeting with Kathleen Corbet today, she requested we put together a marketing campaign around the events in the subprime market''-- now, this is March 2007--``the sooner, the better.'' Why would you want to put together a marketing campaign in March 2007? \1\ See Exhibit No. 52c, which appears in the Appendix on page 439.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I would not use the term marketing campaign. What I did ask was for a more responsive communications campaign around the subprime market, and again, this followed along with a teleconference, an investor teleconference that we put on just about this time, shortly thereafter.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","So you didn't use the term that they said you used?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I don't think that I would have used that term. It was clearly a communications effort.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Going back to this question of what happened late in 2007, in the last 6 months of 2007, after the crunch came, one of the last subprime RMBS deals that was rated was called Citigroup Mortgage Loan Trust, and both S&P and Moody's rated this deal in December 2007. I don't have any exhibits for you to look at, so I will just have to read this more slowly. December 2007, that was months after both of your companies had downgraded thousands of subprime RMBSes. First of all, were you aware that your agency, each of you, gave a AAA rating to four tranches of a $386 million Citibank subprime deal in December 2007? Were you aware of that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","No, I was not.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I was no longer with the company.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. And the press release from your firm-- and I will just address this to you, Mr. McDaniel--when you rated the Citibank deal stated that you expected heightened losses and had accounted for that in the structure of the deal, but there was a 37 percent loss. That is the actual losses as of today. They exceeded any expected loss, obviously, when you rated the deal. But does it surprise you that you were still rating those subprime RMBSes in December 2007, after what happened in July? Does that come as any surprise to you?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I am surprised that there was a subprime RMBS security issued in the market. To the extent that we had updated our views and felt that those views would now be sufficient to provide protection for the ratings assigned, I can understand why the rating committee would do so.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Let me go back again to Exhibit 24b.\1\ There are a lot of interesting things there that your Chief Credit Officer, Mr. Kimball, wrote in October 2007 about issues and weaknesses that the organization needs to address after the subprime market had collapsed. \1\ See Exhibit No. 24b, which appears in the Appendix on page 319. One of the things he wrote, and this is under market share, he says in paragraph five, ``Ideally, competition would be primarily on the basis of ratings quality''--that is ideally-- ``with a second component of price and a third component of service. Unfortunately, of the three competitive factors, rating quality is proving the least powerful.'' Then two lines down, he says, ``The real problem is not that the market does underweights rating quality but rather that, in some sectors it actually penalizes quality by awarding rating mandates based on the lowest credit enhancement needed for the highest rating. Unchecked competition on this basis can place the entire financial system at risk. It turns out that ratings quality has surprisingly few friends; issuers want high ratings; investors don't want rating downgrades; short-sighted bankers labor short-sightedly to game the rating agencies for a few extra basis points on execution.'' Would you agree with that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","In this section, he is talking about the issue of rating shopping, and I agree that existed then and exists now.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. He is analyzing in paragraph seven. He says, ``he market share pressure persists'' in certain areas. This is near the top. ``Moody's has erected safeguards to keep teams from too easily solving the market share problem by lowering standards. These protections do help protect credit quality. Ratings are assigned by committee, not individuals. However,'' he says, ``entire committees, entire departments are susceptible to market share objectives.'' Do you agree with that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Well, in terms of financial incentive, the analysts would not be rewarded for market share or penalized for lack of market share. At management levels, there is more incentive associated with how the overall firm does financially, and so to the extent that there is a greater paid market share as opposed to just market coverage, that would have some impact on compensation at management levels, which is why we need appropriate safeguards and checks and balances.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Do you agree that entire committees are susceptible to market share objectives?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Actually, no, I don't agree----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","All right. Mr. McDaniel . The committees are susceptible to that----",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Fair enough. Mr. McDaniel . Because they are not standing committees. They are ad hoc committees.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","In Exhibit 24b,\1\ paragraph 7(b), he says, ``Methodologies and criteria are published and thus put boundaries on rating committees' discretion.'' Then he says, ``However, there is usually plenty of latitude within those boundaries to register market influence.'' Do you agree with that? \1\ See Exhibit No. 24b, which appears in the Appendix on page 319.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I am not sure what he means by market influence, so I don't know if I agree or not.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. In paragraph 23 of that same exhibit, ``From a credit policy perspective, we want to be in a position to just say no to a market opportunity when imperative to do so from a quality perspective. We have done that in the past.'' He gives some examples. ``How to do it more aggressively without simply exiting whole market sectors is an unsolved problem.'' Would you agree it is an unsolved problem?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","It is an unsolved problem to the extent that the market is not rewarding ratings quality. If we don't have customers for the highest quality ratings, this is an ongoing problem.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. You have a Town Meeting, Exhibit 98.\1\ It is a transcript of Moody's managing directors. You spoke at that Town Meeting in September 2007. On page 63, you said that ``What happened in 2004 and 2005 with respect to subordinated tranches is that our competition, Fitch and S&P, went nuts. Everything was investment grade. It didn't really matter. . . . No one cared because the machine just kept going.'' What do you mean by that? Pretty powerful stuff. Do you stand by that? \1\ See Exhibit No. 98, which appears in the Appendix on page 684.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I was talking about the subordinated tranches in the mortgage-backed securities area. We had a different opinion from our competitors, and we were obviously not being persuasive with the investor community in our more conservative opinion and it was having an impact.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Having an impact on what?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","On our business. We didn't have as much coverage as a result.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Does that mean as much market share?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Both. But really, I was talking about coverage in that case. There were--and the reason I keep making the distinction between market share and market coverage is, I think, that most people would associate market share with paid coverage, and I am talking about the coverage necessary to provide a comparative rating system, comparing one security to another.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Well, you were part of the competition there, Ms. Corbet.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","It says here that S&P ``went nuts. Everything was investment grade.''",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I don't know what he is referring to.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","``It really didn't matter. No one cared, because the machine just kept going.'' Is that true? I wish you would just say, yes, I stand by that, and that is what got us into trouble.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","For the sector I was talking about, I do stand by it.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Ratings kept churning out with poor models. Now, I will use your words. I think that the agencies really went overboard here and really went off the deep end, and here is the reason. You had poor models for these new structures. You had too few resources you were willing to commit. You had too much pressure from investment bankers. And the nuts didn't end until these mass downgrades of July 2007, when it cratered the market for structured finance. This is what one of your managing directors said at that Town Meeting, Exhibit 98, and this is what he or she wrote. ``hy didn't we envision that credit would tighten after being loose, and housing prices would fall after rising, after all most economic events are cyclical and bubbles inevitably burst.'' And then he said, what happened in 2004--he asked then, too, for the leaders to be candid and to acknowledge what the problems were and what had happened, and I think you have a long way to go in acknowledging what happened to your agencies. And this is what he is saying, and I happen to agree with him, that ``Moody's franchise value is based on staying ahead of the pack.'' I would apply this, though, to both. It just happened you guys had a Town Meeting at Moody's. I think the truth of this manager applies to both. He said, ``Moody's franchise value is based on staying ahead of the pack on credit analysis and instead we are in the middle of the pack. I would like more candor from senior management about our errors and how we will address them in the future.'' That is one of the best comments that I have seen, and I hope you would see it that way, but I could understand that may not be the case. The SEC, Ms. Corbet, I think is conducting an investigation of S&P. They conducted an investigation. They found many problems, including staffing levels may have impacted various aspects of the ratings process. Is that true, that the SEC made that finding?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I don't know, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","OK. They found that S&P made changes to its rating criteria without publishing those changes, that S&P, like Moody's, had undocumented policies--I am quoting here-- ``and procedures for rating RMBSes and CDOs.'' Were you familiar with that finding of the SEC?",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","I am not familiar with that finding, no.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","The SEC found relative to Moody's that you had inadequate staffing levels which impacted the rating process, that Moody's analysts were using unpublished models, that Moody's analysts could be influenced in their rating by the fees charged to the issuers, that they were unable to find all the records surrounding a Moody's rating, that Moody's failed to retain or document certain significant steps in the rating process which made it difficult for the staff to assess compliance with its rating policies and procedures, and to identify the factors that were considered in developing a particular rating. Are you familiar with that?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","I am familiar with the SEC examination and the overall findings, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","Did you agree with them?",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","The actions that the SEC asked us to take, we said we would take, so we are complying.",Speech,
"Senator Levin","This is going to complete this panel, but I just have one very brief statement. The Subcommittee now has completed three of its four hearings examining some of the causes and consequences of the 2008 financial crisis. Last week, on Tuesday, we looked at the role of high-risk mortgages. Last Friday's hearing looked at the failures of the bank regulators. Today, we looked at the role of credit rating agencies. It hasn't been a pretty picture so far and I don't think it is going to improve, although, frankly, the beginning of the Senate debate on strong financial reform next week does give us some hope. The final hearing of this quartet will be next Tuesday, when we are going to look at the role of investment banks, with Goldman Sachs being the case history. Our investigation has found that investment banks, such as Goldman Sachs, were not market makers helping clients. They were self-interested promoters of risky and complicated financial schemes that were a major part of the 2008 crisis. They bundled toxic and dubious mortgages into complex financial instruments, got the credit rating agencies to label them as AAA safe securities, sold them to investors, magnifying and spreading risk throughout the financial system, and all too often betting against the financial instruments that they sold and profiting at the expense of their clients. I am introducing into the record now four exhibits that we will be using at the Tuesday hearing to explore the role of investment banks during the financial crisis. We will be putting those exhibits up on the Subcommittee's Website either tonight or tomorrow. We thank this panel. We appreciate your being here. You have given us a great deal of documents. You have cooperated with this Subcommittee and we appreciate it. We will stand adjourned.",Speech,
"Ms. Corbet","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. McDaniel","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
