"Senator Levin","Good morning, everybody. Today the Subcommittee holds the fourth in our series of hearings to explore some of the causes and consequences of the financial crisis. These hearings are the culmination of nearly a year and a half of investigation. The freezing of financial markets and collapse of financial institutions that sparked our investigation are not just a matter of numbers on a balance sheet. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, and their businesses in the recession that the crisis sparked, the worst economic decline since the Great Depression. Behind every number we cite are American families who are still suffering the effects of a man- made economic collapse. Our Subcommittee's goal is to construct a record of the facts in order to deepen public understanding of what went wrong, to inform the ongoing legislative debate about the need for financial reform, and to provide a foundation for building better defenses to protect Main Street from the excesses of Wall Street. Our first hearing dealt with the impact of high-risk mortgage lending and focused on a case study of Washington Mutual Bank, known as WaMu, a thrift whose leaders embarked on a reckless strategy to pursue higher profits by emphasizing high-risk exotic loans. WaMu did not just make loans that were likely to fail, creating hardship for borrowers and risk for the bank. It also built a conveyor belt that fed those toxic loans and mortgages into the financial system like a polluter dumping poison into a river. The poison came packaged in mortgage-backed securities that WaMu sold to get the enormous risk of those loans and their growing default rates off of its own books, dumping that risk into the financial system. Our second hearing examined how Federal regulators saw what was going on but failed to rein in WaMu's reckless behavior. Regulation by the Office of Thrift Supervision (OTS) that should have been conducted at arm's length was instead done arm-in-arm with WaMu. OTS failed to act on major shortcomings it observed, and it thwarted other agencies from stepping in. Our third hearing dealt with credit rating agencies, specifically case studies of Standard & Poor's and Moody's, the Nation's two largest credit raters. While WaMu and other lenders dumped their bad loans into the river of commerce and regulators failed to stop their behavior, the credit rating agencies assured everyone that the poisoned water was safe to drink, slapping AAA ratings on bottles of high-risk financial products. The credit rating agencies operate with an inherent conflict of interest. Their revenue comes from the same firms whose products they are supposed to critically and objectively analyze, and those firms, the firms whose products the credit rating agencies are analyzing, exert pressure on the rating agencies who too often put market share ahead of analytical rigor. Today we will explore the role of investment banks in the development of the crisis. We focus on the activities during 2007 of Goldman Sachs, one of the oldest and most successful firms on Wall Street. Those activities contributed to the economic collapse that came full-blown the following year. Goldman Sachs and other investment banks, when acting properly, play an important role in our economy. They help channel the Nation's wealth into productive activities that create jobs and make economic growth possible, bringing together investors and businesses and helping Americans save for retirement or a child's education. That is when investment banks act properly. But in looking at this crisis, it is not hard to echo the conclusion of another congressional committee which found, ``The results of the unregulated activities of the investment bankers were disastrous.'' That conclusion came in 1934 as the Senate looked into the reasons for the Great Depression, and the parallels are unmistakable to today's events. Goldman Sachs proclaims ``a responsibility to our clients, our shareholders, our employees, and our communities to support and fund ideas and facilitate growth.'' Yet the evidence shows that Goldman repeatedly put its own interests and profits ahead of the interests of its clients and our communities. Its misuse of exotic and complex financial structures helped spread toxic mortgages throughout the financial system. And when the system finally collapsed under the weight of those toxic mortgages, Goldman profited from the collapse. The evidence also shows that repeated public statements by the firm and its executives provide an inaccurate portrayal of Goldman's actions during 2007, the critical year when the housing bubble burst and the financial crisis took hold. The firm's own documents show that while it was marketing risky mortgage-related securities, it was placing large bets against the U.S. mortgage market. The firm has repeatedly denied making those large bets despite overwhelming evidence that they did so. Now, why does that matter? Surely there is no law, ethical guideline, or moral injunction against profit. But Goldman Sachs did not just make money. It profited by taking advantage of its clients' reasonable expectation that it would not sell products that it did not want to succeed, and that there was no conflict of economic interest between the firm and the customers that it had pledged to serve. Those were reasonable expectations of its customers. But Goldman's actions demonstrate that it often saw its clients, not as valuable customers, but as objects for its own profit. This matters because, instead of doing well when its clients did well, Goldman Sachs did well when its clients lost money. Its conduct brings into question the whole function of Wall Street, which traditionally has been seen as an engine of growth, betting on America's successes and not its failures. To understand how the change in investment banks helped bring on the financial crisis, we need to understand first how Wall Street turned bad mortgage loans into economy-wrecking financial instruments. Our previous hearings have covered some of this ground. The story begins with mortgage lenders such as WaMu, Washington Mutual Bank, out there in the State of Washington, which loaned money to homebuyers and then sought to move those loans off of its own books. That activity spawned an ever more complex market in mortgage-backed securities, a market that for a while worked pretty well. But then things turned upside down. The fees that banks and Wall Street firms made from their securitization activities were so large that they ceased to be a means to keep capital flowing to housing markets and became ends in themselves. Mortgages and mortgage-backed securities began to be produced for Wall Street instead of Main Street. Wall Street bond traders sought more and more mortgages from lenders in order to create new securities that generated fees for their firms and large bonuses for themselves. Demand for securities prompted lenders to make more and more riskier mortgage loans. Making and packaging new loans became so profitable that credit standards plummeted, and mortgage lenders began making risky, exotic loans to people with little chance of making the payments owing on those loans and mortgages. Wall Street designed increasingly complex financial products that produced AAA ratings for high-risk products that flooded the financial system. As long as home prices kept rising, the high-risk mortgages posed few problems. Those who could not pay off their loans could refinance or sell their homes, and the market for mortgage-related financial products flourished. But the party could not last, and we all know what happened. Housing prices stopped rising, and the bubble burst. Investors started having second thoughts about the mortgage- backed securities that Wall Street was churning out. In July 2007, two Bear Stearns offshore hedge funds specializing in mortgage-related securities suddenly collapsed. That same month, the credit rating agencies downgraded hundreds of subprime mortgage-backed securities, and the subprime market went cold. Banks, security firms, hedge funds, mutual funds, and other investors were left holding suddenly unmarketable mortgage-backed securities whose values were plummeting. America began feeling the consequences of the economic assault. Goldman Sachs was an active player in building this mortgage machinery. During the period leading up to 2008, Goldman made a lot of money packaging mortgages, getting AAA ratings, and selling securities backed by loans from notoriously poor-quality lenders such as WaMu, Fremont, and New Century. Of special concern was Goldman's marketing of what are known as ``synthetic'' financial instruments. Ordinarily, the financial risk in a market--and, hence, the risk to the economy at large--is limited because the assets traded are finite. There are only so many houses, mortgages, shares of stock, bushels of corn, or barrels of oil in which to invest. But a synthetic instrument has no real assets. It is simply a bet on the performance of the assets that it references. That means the number of synthetic instruments is limitless, and so is the risk that they present to the economy. Synthetic structures referencing high-risk mortgages garnered hefty fees for Goldman Sachs and other investment banks. They assumed an ever larger share of the financial markets and contributed greatly to the severity of the crisis by magnifying the amount of risk in the system. Increasingly, synthetics became bets made by people who had no interest in the referenced assets. Synthetics became the chips in a giant casino, one that created no economic growth, even when it thrived, and then helped throttle the economy when the casino collapsed. But Goldman Sachs did more than earn fees from the synthetic instruments that it created. Goldman also bet against the mortgage market and earned billions when that market crashed. In December 2006, Goldman decided to move away from its long positions in the mortgage market in what began as a prudent hedging against the firm's large exposure to that market--exposure that sparked concern on the part of the firm's senior executives. The edict from top management after a December 14, 2006, meeting was, ``Get closer to home,'' meaning get to a more neutral risk position. But by early 2007, the company blew right past a neutral position on the mortgage market and began betting heavily on its decline, often using complex financial instruments, including synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Goldman took large net short positions throughout 2007. Now, a chart which we are going to put up there is based on data supplied to the Subcommittee by Goldman Sachs.\1\ It tracks the firm's ongoing huge short positions throughout the year. Those short positions at one point represented approximately 53 percent of the firm's risk as measured by the most relied upon risk measure called value at risk (VaR). The black line in the middle of that chart represents a neutral line, balance. The brown numbers and lines below that median black line represent the net short of Goldman during the entire year, and you can see it was net short during that entire year of 2007.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 162, which appears in the Appendix on page 997.  Those short positions did more than just avoid big losses for Goldman. They generated a large profit for the firm in 2007. Goldman says these bets were just a reasonable hedge, but internal documents show that it was more than a reasonable hedge. It was what one top Goldman executive described as the ``big short.'' Listen to a top Goldman mortgage trader, Michael Swenson, who touted his success in 2007, what he called his ``proudest year,'' because of what he called ``extraordinary profits''--$3 billion as of September 2007 that came from bets that he recommended the firm take against the housing market. Mr. Swenson told his superiors, ``I was able to identify key market dislocations that led to tremendous profits.'' Another Goldman mortgage trader, Joshua Birnbaum--and both will be with us this morning--wrote in his performance evaluation about the billions of dollars in profits earned in 2007 betting against the mortgage market. ``The prevailing opinion within the department was that we should just get close to home and pare down our long,'' Mr. Birnbaum wrote. He then touted the fact that he urged Goldman Sachs ``not only to get flat, but get VERY''--emphasized by him--``short.'' He wrote that after convincing his superiors to do just that: ``We implemented the plan by hitting on almost every single name CDO protection buying opportunity in a 2-month period.'' He wrote, ``Much of the plan began working by February as the market dropped 25 points, and our very profitable year was underway.'' When the mortgage market collapsed in July, he said, ``We had a blow-out profit and loss month, making over $1 billion that month.'' Those facts should end the pretense that Goldman's actions were part of its efforts to operate as a mere ``market maker,'' bringing buyers and sellers together. Those short positions did not represent customer service or necessary hedges against risks that Goldman incurred as it made a market for customers. Those short positions represented major bets that the mortgage securities market, a market that Goldman helped create, was in for a major decline. Goldman continues to deny that it shorted the mortgage market for profit, despite the evidence. Why the denial? Why the denial? My best estimate is that it is because the firm, Goldman Sachs, cannot successfully continue to portray itself as working on behalf of its clients if it was selling mortgage- related products to those clients while it was betting its own money against those same products that it was selling to its client or betting against the mortgage market as a whole. The scope of this conflict is reflected in a company email sent on May 17, 2007, discussing the collapse of two mortgage- related instruments tied to WaMu-issued mortgages that Goldman had helped assemble and sell. The ``bad news,'' a Goldman employee says, is that the firm lost $2.5 million on the collapse. But the ``good news,'' he reports, is that the company had bet that the securities would collapse, and they made $5 million on that bet. So they lost money on the mortgage-related products that they still held, and, of course, the clients they sold those products to lost big time. But Goldman Sachs made out big time, because it bet against its own products and its own clients. Goldman's Chief Executive Officer, Lloyd Blankfein, summed it up this way: ``Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money then we made more than we lost because of shorts.'' The conflict of interest that lies behind that statement is striking. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) has filed a civil complaint alleging that in another transaction involving a product called Abacus 07 AC-1, Goldman violated security laws by misleading investors about a mortgage-related instrument. The SEC's complaint alleges that Goldman Sachs, in effect, helped stack the deck against the buyers of the instrument that it sold. The hedge fund that bought the short position in the transaction--in other words, that bet that the product would not perform well--helped select the mortgages that were to be referenced in the product that Goldman sold to its investors. The SEC alleges that Goldman Sachs knew of the hedge fund's selection role and failed to disclose it to the other Abacus investors, who thought the package had been designed to succeed, not fail. We learned in last week's hearing that Goldman also failed to disclose the hedge fund's role to the credit rating agency that rated the Abacus deal. Eric Kolchinsky, who oversaw the ratings process at Moody's, testified before this Subcommittee, ``It just changes the whole dynamic of the structure where the person who is putting it together, choosing it, wants it to blow up.'' The SEC and the courts will resolve the legal question of whether Goldman's actions broke the law. The question for us is one of ethics and policy. Were Goldman's actions in 2007 appropriate? And if not, should we act to bar similar actions in the future? Abacus may be the best-known example of conflicts of interest revealed in the Goldman documents, but it is far from the only example. Anderson Mezzanine Funding 2007-1 was a synthetic product assembled by Goldman. According to company documents, a Goldman client had expressed interest in taking a short position in the transaction, but an executive noted that Dan Sparks, the head of Goldman's Mortgage Department, might ``want to preserve that ability for Goldman.'' What that suggests is that not only was Goldman going to bet against the instrument that it was selling, but it wanted to make that bet badly enough that it took the bet for itself instead of letting an interested client have it. It then sold Anderson securities to its clients without disclosing that it would profit if those securities suffered losses. Client loyalty fell so far that one Goldman employee cited his refusal to assist Goldman clients facing losses from a Goldman financial product as a performance that he felt should be rewarded. Mr. Swenson wrote to his superiors in his performance review, ``I said `no' to clients who demanded that Goldman should support the GSAMP program,'' Goldman Sachs' Subprime Mortgage-Backed Security Program. Mr. Swenson wrote that saying ``no'' to clients who asked Goldman to support a security that it had sold them were ``unpopular positions, but they saved the firm hundreds of millions of dollars.'' Most investors make the assumption that people selling them securities want those securities to succeed. That is how our markets ought to work, but they do not always work that way. The Senators who in the 1930s investigated the causes of the Great Depression stated the principle clearly: ``Investors must believe that their investment banker would not offer them the bonds unless the banker believed them to be safe. This throws,'' they said, ``a heavy responsibility on the banker. He may and does make mistakes. There is no way that he can avoid making mistakes because he is human and because in this world things are only relatively secure. There is no such thing,'' they wrote, ``as an absolute certainty. But,'' those Senators said, looking at the Great Depression a few years afterwards, ``while the banker may make mistakes, he must never make the mistake of offering investments to his clients which he does not believe to be good.'' Goldman documents make clear that in 2007, it was betting heavily against the housing market while it was selling investments in that market to its clients. It sold those clients high-risk mortgage-backed securities and CDOs that it wanted to get off its books in transactions that created a conflict of interest between Goldman's bottom line and its clients' interests. These findings are deeply troubling. They show a Wall Street culture that, while it may once have focused on serving clients and promoting commerce, is now all too often simply self-serving. The ultimate harm here is not just to clients poorly served by their investment bank. It is to all of us. The toxic mortgages and related instruments that these firms injected into our financial system have done incalculable harm to people who had never heard of a mortgage-backed security or a CDO and who have no defenses against the harm such exotic Wall Street creations can cause. Running through our findings in these hearings is a thread that connects the reckless actions of mortgage brokers at Washington Mutual with market-driven credit rating agencies and with the Wall Street executives designing the next synthetic. That thread is unbridled greed and the absence of a cop on the beat to control it. As we speak, lobbyists fill the halls of Congress hoping to weaken or kill legislation aimed at reforming these abuses. Wall Street is on the wrong side of this fight. It insists that reining in those excesses would unduly restrict the free market that is the engine of American progress. But this market of ours is not free of self-dealing nor conflicts of interest. It is not free of gambling debts that taxpayers end up paying. I hope the executives before us today, and their colleagues on Wall Street, will recognize the harm that their actions have caused to so many of their fellow citizens. But whether or not they take responsibility for their role, I hope that this Congress will follow the example of another Congress eight decades ago and enact the reforms that will put a cop back on the Wall Street beat. I want to thank again my Ranking Member, Senator Coburn, who this morning is carrying out a very important responsibility at the White House and who will join us later, for his support and that of his staff. And I recognize now the Acting Ranking Member, Senator Collins. We welcome her participation in this Committee always, and we welcome her remarks. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COLLINS"," "
"Senator Collins","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for leading this investigation into the root causes of the great recession of 2008. You and the Ranking Member, Senator Coburn, have cast a bright light into the dark corners of financial institutions that helped to inflate the housing bubble and then reaped billions of dollars when it burst, leaving millions of Americans in debt and jobless, with destroyed dreams and financial insecurity. This investigation raises two overarching issues. First, we must recognize that the dynamic innovation of our capital markets can have a downside. It can produce pain rather than prosperity. Financial markets, therefore, require updated and effective regulation to help prevent excesses that can inflict great harm on wholly innocent Americans, be they workers, retirees, or small business owners. The lack of regulation of the trillions of dollars in credit default swaps is a prime example, and that is why it is so critical that financial regulatory reform legislation include a council of regulators whose job it will be to assess systemic risk and to identify regulatory gaps. I recognize that even measured regulation may limit the potential benefits that unfettered markets can produce. The question, however, is whether those benefits are outweighed by the terrible harm such unfettered markets can cause. Recent history certainly suggests that is the case, that the combination of lax or absent regulation plus unbridled greed can produce devastating results. The second issue is even legal practices may raise ethical concerns. Assuming Goldman's role as a market maker and its desire to hedge its risk provided legal justification for some of its practices--a question that must ultimately be decided by the courts--there is something unseemly about Goldman betting against the housing market at the same time that it is selling to its clients mortgage-backed securities containing toxic loans. And it is unsettling to read emails of Goldman executives celebrating the collapse of the housing market when the reality for millions of Americans is lost homes and disappearing jobs. That is especially the case in light of Goldman's decision to opt for status as a bank holding company to secure benefits effectively underwritten, at least in part, by those same Americans. During its previous hearings on the financial crisis, this Subcommittee revealed the reckless and at times predatory lending behavior of some mortgage brokers and banks like Washington Mutual. These banks discarded decades of reliable and pragmatic lending practices. Instead they opted to offer high-risk loans to borrowers whom they knew could not afford to repay them. Traditionally, such behavior would have exposed the originating banks to high levels of unacceptable risk. In other words, the offending banks would have paid dearly for their own underwriting errors. But with the advent of securitization during the past decade, lenders have been able to insulate themselves by selling off toxic loans, pitching them as assets to investment banks. Those investment banks in turn bundled the toxic loans inside mortgage-backed securities which were then bought and sold by investors. The cash that flowed back to the banks from investors buying these securities only made matters worse. The cash was akin to throwing fuel on the hot fire of greed and recklessness. The inflow of dollars encouraged loan originators to put that money to work again and again and again, turning over loan applications as quickly as possible, applying little scrutiny, because ultimately they had no stake in the outcome of the loan. This cycle was based on a dangerous and false assumption that the housing market would always move upward. It was based on the fantasy, the myth, that what goes up stays up and never would come crashing down. When it all collapsed like a house of cards, we realized too late how incredibly fragile and tragically interconnected the system had become. The fallout was not limited. The debris field was not contained. The damage was widespread, profound, and nearly catastrophic. The architects of this scheme entangled neighborhood banks and large brokerage firms across America. Their toxic linkages ensnared borrowers and investors from Main Street to Wall Street. They deluded themselves into believing that the basic principles could be defied and ignored. And when that delusion met reality, the bubble burst. Today we will look at the top tier of the system, a major investment bank, and examine how its trading practices amplified the rise and fall of the housing market. Today's witnesses are all from Goldman Sachs, which was one of the few Wall Street firms to actually profit from the financial crisis. This hearing is not to celebrate that ignoble feat; rather, it is to examine how the trading practices of Goldman during that time made such profits possible. It is to examine how Goldman sold financial products that were tied to the health of the housing market, even while Goldman itself was betting that the housing market would collapse. The Securities and Exchange Commission accuses Goldman Sachs of marketing a complex product to its clients while allegedly failing to disclose that the same company that hand- selected the components, the hedge fund Paulson & Company, also planned to bet on its failure. Goldman sold the product to long-time trusting clients allegedly without disclosing this fact. The bet that Paulson made earned him $1 billion while at least one of Goldman's clients, a German bank, went bankrupt. Although Goldman lost money on that particular deal, it reaped billions of dollars in the mortgage-backed securities market as a whole. While the market was on the verge of collapse, Goldman decided to go short and earned billions from that strategy. Some have alleged that Goldman did so while continuing to sell clients long investments in the mortgage markets. While such conflicts of interest may not be illegal, they certainly seemed ethically questionable, and these conflicts of interest appeared to be rooted in the fact that broker-dealers do not have a fiduciary obligation to their clients. That is an issue we will be considering. Clearly, this system must be reformed so that Wall Street banks are not seen and do not act as unscrupulous operators who seek to profit from the public's misfortune, even as they are pitching toxic investments and even as hard-working, struggling taxpayers are left to pick up the tab. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, again, I congratulate you for this in-depth investigation."
"Senator Levin","Thank you so much, Senator Collins. Senator Kaufman was next in line. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR KAUFMAN"," "
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Senator Kaufman, I want to thank you for all your work on these hearings. You have been very significant and important to us."
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, and I want to thank you and Ranking Member Coburn for having these hearings, 3 days of hearings. I think we looked at Washington Mutual, then we looked at the regulators, and then we looked at the rating agencies. It was a pretty ugly picture, repeated conflicts of interest and in some cases outright fraud. All of the figures from those 3 days of hearings points to Wall Street which created and sold these toxic investments to their clients. Today I am looking forward to talking about the behavior of Goldman Sachs during this period. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator Kaufman."
"Senator McCain"," "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MCCAIN"," "
"Senator McCain","Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the witnesses for being here today. Mr. Chairman, I do not know if Goldman Sachs has done anything illegal. Charges have been brought, and it is going to be the subject of a lot of our discussion today. But from the reading of these emails and the information that this Subcommittee has uncovered, there is no doubt their behavior was unethical, and the American people will render a judgment, as well as the courts."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator McCain. Senator McCaskill. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR MCCASKILL"," "
"Senator McCaskill","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In the good old days of investment banking, they were considered very honorable and proud institutions, our investment bankers of Wall Street. They provided financial services, investment of capital in good businesses, helping government with assistance to issue bonds to build the great infrastructure of our Nation. Then you fast-forward through the public offering of all these companies where the date that the risk of these companies shifted from the named partners to nameless, faceless shareholders. And you fast-forward a little bit further, and you land right at the feet of synthetic CDOs. Now, I have got to be honest. I think that if we had to put the odds on this hearing today, you guys would probably have odds in your favor because the jargon is complicated, the transactions are complicated. You have relied on that complicated situation to avoid a lot of scrutiny. We have spent a lot of time going through all these documents, and let me just explain in very simple terms what synthetic CDOs are. They are instruments that are created so that people can bet on them. It is the La-La Land of ledger entries. It is not investment in a business that has a good idea. It is not assisting local governments in building infrastructure. It is gambling--pure and simple raw gambling. They are called synthetics because there is nothing there but the gamble, the bet. You are the bookie. You are the house. You have less oversight and less regulation, as you began this Wild, Wild West of tranches, waterfalls, equity tranches, and residual warehousing. As you began all that, you had less oversight than a pit boss in Las Vegas. And I got to tell you--and it is not just you. All of you were lemming-like. You were chasing each other. What you worried about most was a bad article in the Wall Street Journal, not a regulator. You were chasing compensation. You were chasing your colleagues and other investment banks. And you were trying to make a killing. But let me just tell you, you think it is so complicated and you think you are so smart? Any street gambler would never place a bet with a bookie or a house with the record that is revealed in the documents that this Subcommittee has gathered. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator McCaskill."
"Senator Pryor"," "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR PRYOR"," "
"Senator Pryor","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank you for having this hearing this morning. And, Mr. Chairman, I know that you did not just open up the paper last week and say, ``Hey, let us have a hearing on Goldman Sachs.'' I know that you have been working on this for a year and a half, and through your dogged determination, you have uncovered a lot of emails, a lot of documentation that raise a lot of very serious questions. And so, Mr. Chairman, I know the Nation appreciates your determination and your commitment to provide the oversight that Congress should be providing. So I want to thank you for that, and I may not understand everything about everything on Wall Street, but I do understand that people are not here to listen to me, they are here to listen to the witnesses. So I want to thank you very much for having this hearing today, and I look forward to this hearing. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Thank you so much, Senator Pryor. Let me start out by saying we are going to have three panels today, and each of these panels are going to take some time because this is a subject which needs some real exploration and detail to cut through all of those technical words and concepts that Senator McCaskill just made reference to. So let me now welcome our first panel of witnesses for this morning's hearing: Daniel Sparks, a former partner and head of the Mortgage Department at Goldman Sachs; Joshua Birnbaum, a former Managing Director of the Structured Products Group Trading Desk at Goldman Sachs; Michael Swenson, a Managing Director on the Structured Products Group Trading Desk at Goldman Sachs; and Fabrice Tourre, an Executive Director in Structured Products Group Trading at Goldman Sachs International. We appreciate all of you being with us this morning. We have a rule on this Subcommittee, Rule VI, that all witnesses who testify before the Subcommittee are required to be sworn, and so at this time I would ask all of you to please stand and raise your right hand. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?"
"Mr. Sparks","I do."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do."
"Mr. Swenson","I do."
"Mr. Tourre","I do."
"Senator Levin","We will use a timing system today. We would ask that you try to limit your oral testimony to no more than 5 minutes. About a minute before that red light comes on, you will be given a yellow light so you can have that kind of assistance. Mr. Sparks, we are going to have you go first, followed by Mr. Birnbaum, then Mr. Swenson, then finishing up with Mr. Tourre, and then we will turn to our questions. So, Mr. Sparks, please proceed. "
"TESTIMONY OF DANIEL L. SPARKS,\1\ FORMER PARTNER, HEAD OF MORTGAGE DEPARTMENT, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., NEW CANAAN, CONNECTICUT"," "
"Mr. Sparks","Chairman Levin, Dr. Coburn, and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Dan Sparks, and from late 2006 until mid-2008, I was the head of the Mortgage Department at Goldman Sachs. The three men who are with me today--Fabrice Tourre, Josh Birnbaum, and Mike Swenson--all reported up to me during that period.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Sparks appears in the Appendix on page 202.  I joined Goldman Sachs in 1989 as an analyst after graduating from college. My intention was to stay for 2 years, and I ended up staying for 19. I would not have stayed if the people I worked with did not have high ethical standards. The culture at Goldman Sachs was one in which excellence and integrity were expected. The business of Goldman's Mortgage Department involved structuring, underwriting, distributing, and trading mortgage and asset-backed products, including loans, securities, and derivatives. All these activities involved clients, and all involved risk. The business was competitive, and Goldman participated without a significant residential mortgage origination platform. I know that the Subcommittee is focusing on the events of late 2006 and 2007, so I will as well. Near the end of 2006, Goldman was generally long in its exposure to residential mortgages. I had concerns about our exposures, and senior management knew about these concerns. The markets showed signs of stress, and our department was experiencing losses. In mid- December, David Viniar, Goldman's Chief Financial Officer (CFO), called a meeting and asked me to comprehensively review our positions and business risks. The ``take-away'' from the meeting was to reduce risk in the short term. I was not instructed to ``go long'' or to ``go short.'' The focus was on risk and not direction. Risk management during this period was very challenging. In a volatile and illiquid market, we had to change business approaches constantly. We were diligent in marking our positions daily, as painful as that was on many days. That discipline gave us real-time feedback and helped us make important risk decisions. These included reducing our loan purchases, buying jump-risk protection, shutting down our CDO warehouse activities at significant losses, and covering our shorts. Knowing whether we were long or short was often difficult, as our positions were complex and the market moved erratically. There were times when our analytical risk measures told us one thing, and my experience and knowledge of our positions told me something else. Some days, we took actions to reduce risk only to see the firm's value at risk (VaR), increase. During this time, there were differing views within the Mortgage Department, and around the firm, as to the direction of the residential mortgage markets. But the constant theme from senior management was to reduce risk. Throughout 2007, the Mortgage Department reacted to market events, worked with our clients, and managed our risk. I left Goldman Sachs in mid-2008 to spend more time with my family and in my community and to pursue other interests. When I left, I was proud of what the people in the Mortgage Department had accomplished during a difficult period, and I remain so today. At the same time, I understand that events in the Nation's mortgage market contributed to the financial crisis of 2008 and to the recession. I also understand that Congress has a duty to explore the causes of that crisis and to adopt sound reforms. To that end, I look forward to being helpful to you this morning."

"Mr. Birnbaum","Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Josh Birnbaum. Thank you for offering me this opportunity to discuss my work in the Mortgage Department at Goldman Sachs in 2006 and 2007, when I was a Managing Director in the Structured Products Group. I began working at Goldman shortly after my graduation from the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania in 1993. I worked at Goldman until March 2008, when I left to start my own advisory firm, Tilden Park Capital Management. I take great pride from having worked for Goldman Sachs for almost 15 years and greatly admire the firm's integrity, commitment to client service, and ethics.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Birnbaum appears in the Appendix on page 205.  During 2006 and 2007, I worked on the Asset-Backed Securities (ABS), Desk in the Structured Products Group. My job was to make markets for Goldman clients who sought long or short exposure to the market for residential housing asset- backed securities and to assist in hedging investments made by other parts of the Mortgage Department. The primary products I traded and risk-managed were the then newly created Asset-Backed Securities Index (ABX), and credit default swaps (CDS) in individual securitizations, also known as single-name CDS. As a market maker, we were continuously asked to provide liquidity for customers, which frequently required the firm to participate on the other side of transactions on a ``principal'' basis. For example, when a client wanted to buy protection on a particular securitization, we would offer a price to sell that protection. If the client chose to execute the transaction at that price, we would take the other side of the trade. We would then have a decision to make whether to offset that risk through a transaction with another client who wanted to sell that protection to us or keep it on our book for some period of time as part of our inventory. From time to time, as a result of client-driven trades, our team's book accumulated long and short positions. For example, from the inception of the ABX Index in January 2006 through November 2006, customers interested in selling the ABX Index outnumbered buyers. The trades we made to meet client demands during that period naturally caused the book to develop a long position in the ABX Index and a smaller short position in the single-name CDS. As part of our management of our own inventory, we had the discretion to hedge positions through trades with other clients or keep them on our book in accordance with the limits set by the risk management department. Whenever our inventory got significantly long or short, risk management directed us to cut our risk and ``get closer to home,'' or to ``flatten the book.'' For example, when our net position became long in late 2006, we were told to offset our risks, which we did through a combination of selling off some of the long ABX position and buying more single-name CDS protection. And when our inventory expressed a short bias at times in 2007, we were directed to cover our short positions to reduce risk, and we did so. In late 2006 and into early 2007, I developed a negative view on the likely direction of the subprime market. Traders on desks like ours often develop a short or long bias based on their personal views of the market. Not everyone in the Mortgage Department--or the firm, for that matter--agreed with my view at the time. In fact, there was a vigorous debate as to the future direction of the market. In line with my view, our desk began to accumulate short positions, purchasing protection on individual securities through credit default swaps, largely from external CDO managers who asked us to bid for these positions. There was, of course, risk involved in accumulating short positions, as no one could be certain which direction the market would go. These positions became profitable as the market deteriorated. When those short positions bumped up against the risk parameters for our book during the spring and summer of 2007, my group was instructed to cover them. On both occasions, I expressed my belief that the market would continue to deteriorate and that the better, more profitable trade was to maintain the short position on our book, but the firm insisted that we reduce our position, and we did so. No one from senior management told me to make a directional bet against the subprime market. Rather, during 2006 to 2007, regardless of whether our books were long or short, the consistent theme from management was get smaller, reduce risks, and get closer to home. I am very proud of the accomplishments of the ABS Group during my tenure there. We provided significant liquidity to our clients in a difficult and challenging market while also managing to post a profit during this period. Thank you for inviting me to testify here. I am happy to answer any questions Subcommittee members may have."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Birnbaum. Mr. Swenson. "
"TESTIMONY OF MICHAEL J. SWENSON,\1\ MANAGING DIRECTOR, STRUCTURED PRODUCTS GROUP TRADING, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., NEW YORK, NEW YORK"," "
"Mr. Swenson","Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Coburn, Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Michael Swenson. I am a Managing Director in the Mortgage Department at Goldman Sachs, where I have worked since 2000.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Swenson appears in the Appendix on page 208.  Let me begin by discussing my role with the firm in 2006 and 2007 and then give you a general timeline of the activities of the ABS Desk through this period. I was a Managing Director in Structured Products Group (SPG) Trading and co-managed the group. I was primarily responsible for the Asset-Backed Securities (ABS) desk, which was responsible for making markets in ABS securities and derivatives for our customer franchise. The ABS Desk traded consumer ABS, subprime cash, single-name ABS credit default swaps--which I will refer to as ``single names''--and the ABX indices, which are a family of synthetic indices that reference a standard basket of 20 subprime deals. Throughout 2006, numerous clients wanted to sell the ABX in order to express a negative view on the U.S. residential housing market. As a result of these trades, we took on long positions as principal. In order to hedge those positions, we began to increase our short position in single names. By November 2006, the volatility in the ABX increased, pushing prices down. Because our positions in single names did not match identically the basket of securities that comprised the ABX, the positions moved at different rates and even different directions, resulting in losses for the ABS Desk. On December 14, 2006, David Viniar, the firm's CFO, called a meeting to go over the firm's Mortgage Department's positions and risk. I attended a portion of that meeting, during which we discussed the ABS positions and the need to reduce the basis risk in the book. We were instructed to reduce risk and get the position ``closer to home''; we were not told what direction to take--just to get there. In the first quarter of 2007, we sold ABX, where possible, and increased our single-name positions. However, the ABS Desk continued to lose money because the market value of our long ABX positions was declining faster than our offsetting hedges. The relatively rapid decline in the index brought in a wave of short-covering and some new long interest. As a result, the ABS Desk further reduced its long ABX position and purchased additional single names, or went long on $2.8 billion in single names, thus reducing our short position. In the second quarter of 2007, the ABS Desk covered several billion notional in single names and purchased hundreds of millions of ABX long positions as the ABX index recovered. These transactions reduced the desk's short position, in effect bringing the desk to a more balanced position. Later in the quarter, the ABS Desk increased its short position after it took on the CDO warehouse inventory from the CDO origination group. The inventory added several billions in long residential mortgage-backed securities (RMBS) exposure to the ABS Desk at a time when the market was deteriorating. In order to manage this newly assumed risk, the ABS Desk increased our position in single names. At the end of the third quarter, the ABS Desk engaged in large block trades purchasing several billion notional of ABX risk while concurrently selling down a portion of our single- name positions--again, bringing the desk closer to home. Throughout the period from late 2006 through much of 2007, the ABS Desk executed its market-making functions as principal, and our trades also reflected the views we had of the market. The ABS Desk did not only take short positions and, indeed, took many positions that ultimately reduced profits that the Mortgage Department otherwise might have realized. By reducing short positions, we left money on the table. But that is the nature of reducing risk while continuing to perform our duties as a market maker. Thank you for your consideration. I am happy to answer any questions Members of the Subcommittee may have."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Swenson. Mr. Tourre, am I pronouncing your name correctly?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, you are, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you. "
"TESTIMONY OF FABRICE P. TOURRE,\1\ EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, STRUCTURED PRODUCTS GROUP TRADING, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., LONDON, ENGLAND"," "
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, Members of the Subcommittee, good morning. My name is Fabrice Tourre, and I work at Goldman Sachs International in London. Thank you for the opportunity to appear today in front of the Subcommittee.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Tourre appears in the Appendix on page 211.  I have worked at Goldman Sachs since 2001. Between 2004 and 2007, my job was primarily to make markets for clients. I made markets by connecting clients who wished to take a long exposure to an asset--meaning they anticipated the value of the asset would rise--with clients who wished to take a short exposure to an asset--meaning they anticipated the value of the asset would fall. I was an intermediary between highly sophisticated professional investors--all of which were institutions. None of my clients were individual, retail investors. The structured products on which I worked fill an important need for these sophisticated financial institutions. To the average person, the utility of these products may not be obvious. But they permit sophisticated institutions to customize the exposures they wish to take in order to better manage the credit and market risks of their investment holdings. Mr. Chairman, as you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission recently filed a civil suit alleging that I failed to disclose to investors certain material information regarding a transaction that I helped to structure named Abacus 07 AC-1. I deny categorically the SEC's allegations, and I will defend myself in court against this false claim. Since the suit was filed, there have been many questions raised about the AC-1 transaction and my role in it. I appreciate the opportunity to answer those questions, and I want to make a few points absolutely clear. First, the only two investors in the transaction, ACA and IKB, were institutions with significant resources and extensive experience in the CDO market. Second, I never told ACA, the portfolio selection agent, that Paulson & Company would be an equity investor in the AC-1 transaction or would take any long position in the deal. Although I don't recall the exact words that I used, I recall informing ACA that Paulson's fund was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior tranches in this deal. This necessarily meant that Paulson was expected to take some short position in the transaction. Moreover, from the early stages of the transaction in January 2007 to its completion several months later, none of the offering documents provided to ACA indicated that Paulson's fund would be an equity investor. If ACA was confused about Paulson's role in the transaction, it had every opportunity to clarify the issue. Representatives of Paulson's fund participated directly in all of my meetings with ACA regarding the transaction. I do not ever recall ACA asking me or Paulson's representatives if Paulson's fund would be an equity investor. Indeed, ACA and Paulson had several discussions about the transaction and at least one meeting without Goldman Sachs representatives present. Quite frankly, I am surprised that ACA could have believed that the Paulson fund was an equity or long investor in this deal. Third, the AC-1 transaction was not designed to fail. ACA and IKB were two of the most important clients to my desk. Moreover, the securities referenced in the transaction did not underperform the other securities of that ratings class and vintage. In fact, all those securities performed poorly because the subprime mortgage market suffered a broad collapse. Goldman Sachs also had no economic motive to design the AC-1 transaction to fail. Quite the contrary, we held long exposure in the transaction just like ACA and just like IKB. When the securities referenced in AC-1 declined in value, we lost money, too, including around $83 million with respect to the retained long position. Finally, ACA selected the portfolio of securities referenced in the transaction--not Paulson. ACA had sole authority to decide what securities would be referenced in the transaction, and it does not dispute that fact. Neither the Paulson fund nor Goldman Sachs could dictate to ACA the securities referenced in the deal. Paulson's fund made suggestions to ACA, as did IKB and as did Goldman Sachs. And the SEC complaint concedes that ACA rejected most of Paulson's suggestions while accepting others. So, while Paulson, Goldman Sachs, and IKB all had inputs in the reference portfolio for AC-1, ACA ultimately analyzed and approved each security in the transaction. Thus, when Goldman Sachs represented to investors that ACA selected the referenced portfolio, that statement was absolutely correct. Mr. Chairman, the last week has been challenging for me and my family, as I have been the target of unfounded attacks on my character and motives. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee to answer these false charges. I wish to repeat: I did not mislead IKB or ACA, two of the most sophisticated institutional investors in these products anywhere in the world. I will be pleased to answer any questions that the Subcommittee may have."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Tourre. What we will do is what we have done in previous hearings. Our rounds--at least the first round--will be 20 minutes for each of us, and then there will be subsequent rounds with these panels as well. Mr. Sparks, would you turn to Exhibit 172,\1\ please?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 172, which appears in the Appendix on page   "
"Senator Levin","All set?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Now, this is a series of emails that concerns a deal called Anderson that Goldman put together in March 2007. Anderson was a $300 million synthetic CDO, so what it did was reference certain other securities. This referenced subprime RMBSs, or residential mortgage-backed securities. Many of those securities were originated by New Century, which was a subprime lender notorious for poor-quality loans. Goldman participated as one of the short investors, as you can see from that exhibit. They bought loss protection or bought the short side for $100 million, about 50 percent of the short side and 50 percent of the referenced assets. So from the beginning of the deal, right from the beginning, Goldman is selling Anderson securities to clients, but it is betting against that CDO. It got, in the words there, protection that pays off if the CDO assets, the referenced assets, start losing money. So, first, if you will take a look at the following email. Goldman's clients reject the deal, first of all, because it has so much poor-quality New Century mortgages. For example, look at page 3 of the exhibit. A client asks how Goldman got ``comfortable'' with all the New Century collateral, and particularly the New Century serviced deals. Now, take a look at the internal response at the top of the page. What it is is to get Goldman's salespeople on the phone to allay the client's concerns about New Century collateral, but that does not work. The next three emails tell the same story. Three more clients--Rabobank, Smith Breeden, and Terwin--reject the deal. Internally, the drive to sell Anderson continues--keep pushing the clients to buy. Look at the top of page 6. ``Anything more from these guys - or are they officially dead now?'' Now, Goldman is asked a question by a potential customer. What did you guys do to get comfortable with all the New Century collateral? How can you get comfortable with that collateral? That is a well-known company that has a very bad record. And what is your response? Is your response, ``Hey, we are going short. We got half the short side?'' We are betting against this deal? You are asked a specific question. How do you guys get comfortable with this? Instead of saying, ``Hey, we are betting against it, we are taking half the short side,'' what you do is you tell your salespeople try to sell this deal. You do not answer the question. You do not respond to a direct question. So you continue to push hard, and finally there is a sale that unloads $20 million in Anderson notes. Page 7 of that same exhibit, a Goldman supervisor responds with a single word after you unloaded $20 million in Anderson notes: ``Profit!'' Exclamation point. Eureka. ``Eureka'' is my word. He later congratulates the team: ``Excellent job pushing to closure these deals in a period of extreme difficulty.'' Now, your clients did not want to buy Anderson CDOs with that exposure to the New Century mortgages, but you still pushed hard. Why didn't you inform your clients that Goldman was short on nearly 50 percent of the Anderson CDO when selling Anderson securities to them? Why didn't you tell them you were going short?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, there are about eight emails in here. I did not see the email that suggested that we were short, and I was trying to find that."
"Senator Levin","All right. Take a look at Exhibit 93.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 93, which appears in the Appendix on page 592. "
"Mr. Sparks","Within this exhibit?"
"Senator Levin","No. Exhibit 93."
"Mr. Sparks","OK."
"Senator Levin","And Exhibit 94,\2\ together, showing the shorts.  \2\ See Exhibit No. 94, which appears in the Appendix on page 593  See where it shows the counterparty, the short side of the deal? Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs, Goldman Sachs. See all that?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","OK. Now, answer my question."
"Mr. Sparks","I believe this shows the counterparties, which----"
"Senator Levin","Yes, Goldman Sachs."
"Mr. Sparks","Oftentimes is Goldman Sachs. That does not mean that Goldman Sachs was not doing that trade with another client, so it is very difficult for me to say from looking at this whether we were short or not. We might have been facilitating trades for clients."
"Senator Levin","Assuming you were going short and staying short. Let me ask the question. Should you have told that client--when they asked how are you getting comfortable with this, should you have told them you were going short if you were?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, so not particular to this, because, again, I do not recall if----"
"Senator Levin","No, in this case. I am asking in this case. You were asked a question. How do you guys get comfortable with these kind of mortgages, with this kind of a mortgage broker?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, I do not know if we were short on that deal----"
"Senator Levin","I know you do not know. Assuming you went short and intended to stay short on that deal, should you have then told the customer asking you the direct question, how can you get comfortable with this, that it was your intention to go short on 50 percent of the short side and stay that way, if that was the fact?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again----"
"Senator Levin","No. Answer my question."
"Mr. Sparks","I am just trying to understand exactly what the question is."
"Senator Levin","The question is very clear. You said, well, you were not sure whether or not you were buying that 50 percent for somebody else. That is what your answer was. If you were buying, as we know you were, 50 percent of the short for yourself, for your account, my question is, when asked how can you be selling this security, how do you get comfortable with the source of this security, was there an obligation at that time, if you were going and intended to stay short with half the short side, was it your responsibility to answer that direct question, hey, we are going short and we are staying short? How do you view your responsibility--that is my question--under those circumstances?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, this transaction was a static synthetic, which meant the assets were the assets and they could not change. Anybody participating in it should look at the assets themselves."
"Senator Levin","Are those assets open to everyone who buys those synthetics, the specific assets, or are they protected? Are those not commercially protected, the specific source?"
"Mr. Sparks","If that is a legal question, people have access to the information, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","The buyer is raising a question with you about these assets. He is asking a direct question: How can you get comfortable with these assets from this source? How do you guys get comfortable? Your answer is not, under my hypothetical--which is not hypothetical; it is factual. But assuming you are going to buy half the short position and keep it, my question is: Did you not have a responsibility to answer a direct question, how can you get comfortable with these products from that source by saying we are going short, half the short is what we are buying? How do you view your ethical responsibility?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, and again, the facts about----"
"Senator Levin","Again, you do not want to answer the question."
"Mr. Sparks","No. The question that investors should and did focus on were whether the names that they had risk to was something they actually wanted at that price."
"Senator Levin","My question, Mr. Sparks, is a very direct question. You were asked a question, Goldman was asked a question: How do you get comfortable with the source of these securities? Instead of disclosing right at that time, what I think you ought to disclose anyway when you are on the other side of a deal--we will get into that. But instead of disclosing that you had half of the other side of the deal, half the short side, you did not tell them that. Instead you told your salespeople, ``Keep pushing this deal.'' You had three people turn it down because of the source, and you kept pushing it. But now answer my question. When you are asked the question, how do you get comfortable with these securities given the dubious source of the security--you got clients, they do not want to buy the security with so much exposure to the New Century mortgages. Those New Century mortgages have had problems. I am going to ask you for the last time, and if you do not want to answer it, you can say you do not want to answer it. But, clearly, you understand it. Did you not have a responsibility when you were asked point blank how do you get comfortable in this kind of a situation when there is so much exposure to New Century mortgages, did you not then at least have an obligation to disclose, hey, we are not comfortable, we are selling this thing short, we are going on the short side? Do you understand the question?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, I understand the question. I have not gone through all of the emails, but what clients who did not want to participate in that deal did not."
"Senator Levin","And the client asked you a question, how do you guys get comfortable--it is a question. What was your answer?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, we----"
"Senator Levin","Did you tell them----"
"Mr. Sparks","We would have had the sales force get on with the deal team and walk through each security that they had exposure to and answer any questions that they had about that security."
"Senator Levin","Don't you also have a duty to disclose an adverse interest to your client? Do you have that duty?"
"Mr. Sparks","About?"
"Senator Levin","If you have an adverse interest to your client, do you have the duty to disclose that to your client?"
"Mr. Sparks","The question about how the firm is positioned or our desk is positioned?"
"Senator Levin","If you have an adverse interest to your client when you are selling something to them, do you have the responsibility to tell that client of your adverse interest?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, I am just trying to understand what the adverse interest means----"
"Senator Levin","No, I think you understand it. I do not think you want to answer. How did you get comfortable with all the New Century collateral?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, I----"
"Senator Levin","I am just going to go on because you are not going to answer the question. It is obvious. In particular, let me ask you this question. Keep going now on that exhibit.\1\ Considering that you are holding the equity--do you see that in that email chain, March 13, 2007?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 172, which appears in the Appendix on page  "
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","They thought you were actually holding the equity, which is being on the long side, right?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes. In this email, that is what this looks like."
"Senator Levin","So they thought you are on the long side, but not told you are on the short side of the same deal when specifically asked the question as to how you got comfortable, not disclosing that you are betting against it, not just buying the equity. Now, let me keep going. By the way, that Anderson deal was downgraded from AAA to junk in 7 months. Did you make money on that deal, on the short position?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I know on the longs that we took, we lost money."
"Senator Levin","I understand. I am asking about the short position you took."
"Mr. Sparks","And on the shorts, Mr. Chairman, I do not know how much of it we had, if any."
"Senator Levin","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","And so I cannot--I just do not have that number."
"Senator Levin","Do you want to check your records and tell us how much money you made on that?"
"Mr. Sparks","I will have to get back to you and work with the people at Goldman Sachs."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Sparks, turn to Exhibit 173.\2\ This is an email message, November 2006, between two Goldman Sachs employees in sales. It discusses selling Fremont securities. One salesperson sends to the other a client's explanation of why they do not want to buy the securities--even after talking to Fremont, by the way. The client wrote, ``. . . remont refused to make any forward looking statements so we really got nothing from them on the crap pools''--``the crap pools that are out there now.''  \2\ See Exhibit No. 173, which appears in the Appendix on page   The salesperson wrote, ``They are concerned about all the Fremont exposure they already have,'' and they ``are going to put Fremont `in the box' for the time being.'' Were you aware of the poor reputation that Fremont had, and that is, loans among the highest default rates in the country? Were you aware of it at the time?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, can I just read the email?"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 173. Do you see it? ``remont refused to make any forward looking statements so we really got nothing from them on the crap pools that are out there now.'' Do you see that?"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not want to slow you down. I have not read the whole thing, so I----"
"Senator Levin","I am just asking you, look at the bottom paragraph there, the last two lines. ``remont refused to make any forward looking statements so we really got nothing from them on the crap pools that are out there now.'' Do you see that?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","OK. Now, were you aware of Fremont's poor reputation at the time?"
"Mr. Sparks","This email----"
"Senator Levin","Do you remember whether you were aware at the time of their poor reputation? Do you remember?"
"Mr. Sparks","Whether they had a poor reputation in November?"
"Senator Levin","Yes, with high default rates."
"Mr. Sparks","Fremont originated subprime loans. People understood that."
"Senator Levin","Yes or no, were you aware of their poor reputation and high default rate."
"Mr. Sparks","I do not recall at that time."
"Senator Levin","You sold about $700 million in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities, helping Fremont do that. Within 10 months, those securities were downgraded and today have junk status. You also bought some of the Fremont securities, immediately bought loss protection through a CDS on those securities. In other words, you were betting against those securities at the same time you were selling those crap pools to your client. Do you know how much money you made on those shorts? Do you remember?"
"Mr. Sparks","Chairman, I do not remember. The one point I would say about this email is it looks like the customer had the chance to evaluate the investment and decided not to invest."
"Senator Levin","I am just telling you how much you sold of the securities. I just informed you that Goldman--helped Fremont package and sell $700 million in subprime residential mortgage-backed securities. That is what I am telling you when I am asking you that. You also took out a short position. Do you know how much you made?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, sir, I do not."
"Senator Levin","Now, take a look at Timberwolf, a Timberwolf deal which is Exhibit 105.\1\ This is a $1 billion hybrid CDO, squared so-called, that Goldman put together and underwrote in the first quarter of 2007. Timberwolf references a variety of assets, including $15 million from an Abacus CDO and more from a Washington Mutual Option ARM.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 105, which appears in the Appendix on page 674.  Goldman Sachs participated in this deal as one of the short buyers. Do you remember that? Can you see that from that?"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not see where it says that we were short."
"Senator Levin","Well, you will just have to assume that my statement is accurate for the time being. It is accurate. I want to go on. You participated in the deal as one of the protection buyers. You do not remember that? You do not remember Timberwolf? You do not remember participating----"
"Mr. Sparks","No. I remember Timberwolf."
"Senator Levin","Do you remember whether you were on the short side?"
"Mr. Sparks","I remember a few things about Timberwolf."
"Senator Levin","Do you remember whether you were on the short side? Do you remember? Yes or no."
"Mr. Sparks","We likely would have provided a number of shorts, and I do not recall if we covered them or not."
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Sparks","I also recall----"
"Senator Levin","But not whether you covered them. That means you would have sold them down the line. But in any event, would you have stood to gain, do you remember, if Timberwolf assets declined in value or if they defaulted or if there was a credit downgrade? Do you remember?"
"Mr. Sparks","I know that on the Timberwolf deal, with the longs we took, we lost hundreds of millions of dollars."
"Senator Levin","I am talking about the shorts. The profits on the shorts consistently--and that happened throughout the year--more than made up for what you lost on longs. Do you know how much you made on the shorts?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, on that particular deal, I would be surprised if that is true with respect to the gain/loss outcome."
"Senator Levin","OK. Timberwolf closed at the end of 2007. Your sales team sold $600 million in Timberwolf securities. Take a look at Exhibit 155.\2\ Do you see that?  \2\ See Exhibit No. 155, which appears in the Appendix on page 971. "
"Mr. Sparks","I see a list of sales on CDOs."
"Senator Levin","OK. Take my word for it. It is $600 million. Your sales team--now, take a look at Exhibit 105."
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, on Exhibit 155----"
"Senator Levin","No, just go to Exhibit 105. I will come back to Exhibit 155."
"Mr. Sparks","Could I just clarify? You are talking about-- there were sales to two counterparties. One was Greywolf, who was the manager."
"Senator Levin","Of Timberwolf."
"Mr. Sparks","The other was Bear Stearns Asset Management. Is that what you are asking me to look at?"
"Senator Levin","I asked you to look at Exhibit 105."
"Mr. Sparks","OK."
"Senator Levin","Now, before you sold all that stuff that we just described in Exhibit 155, $600 million of Timberwolf securities is what you sold. Before you sold them, this is what your sales team were telling to each other. Got it? Exhibit "
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Look what your sales team was saying about Timberwolf: ``Boy that Timberwolf was one shi**y deal.'' They sold that shi**y deal."
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, this email was from the head of the division, not the sales force. This was----"
"Senator Levin","Whatever it was, it is an internal Goldman document."
"Mr. Sparks","This was an email to me in late June."
"Senator Levin","Right. And you sold----"
"Mr. Sparks","After the transaction."
"Senator Levin","No. You sold Timberwolf after as well."
"Mr. Sparks","We did trades after that."
"Senator Levin","Yes, OK. The trades after----"
"Mr. Sparks","Some context might be helpful."
"Senator Levin","The context, let me tell you, the context is mighty clear. June 22 is the date of this email: ``Boy, that Timberwolf was one shi**y deal.'' How much of that shi**y deal did you sell to your clients after June 22, 2007?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, I do not know the answer to that, but the price would have reflected levels that they wanted to invest at that time."
"Senator Levin","You did not tell them you thought it was a shi**y deal?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I did not say that."
"Senator Levin","No. Who did? Your people internally. You knew it was a shi**y deal, and that is what your email shows."
"Mr. Sparks","And, again, I think the context, the message that I took from the email from Mr. Montag was that my performance on that deal was not good, and I think the fact that we had lost money related to that was not good----"
"Senator Levin","How about the fact that you sold hundreds of millions of that deal after your people knew it was a shi**y deal? Does that bother you at all? You sold a customer something----"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not recall selling hundreds of millions of that deal after that."
"Senator Levin","All right. Let us take a look. Exhibit 166 is a series of emails.\1\ The first is June 26, 2007. That is after June 22. A July 1, 2007, email tells the sales force the top priority is Timberwolf. Your top priority to sell is that shi**y deal.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 166, which appears in the Appendix on page  "
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, my comment was I did not recall the sales, not that we were trying to sell."
"Senator Levin","OK, you are trying to sell a shi**y deal, and it is your top priority. Come on, Mr. Sparks."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Mr. Chairman----"
"Senator Levin","Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell--and, by the way, it sold it, a lot of it, after that date. Should Goldman Sachs be trying to sell a shi**y deal?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well----"
"Senator Levin","Can you answer that one?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again, I did not use those words."
"Senator Levin","Can you answer that one yes or no?"
"Mr. Sparks","There are prices in the market that people want to invest in things. I did not use that term with respect to this deal."
"Senator Levin","Who did use that term? Who is Tom Montag? Who is Daniel Sparks?"
"Mr. Sparks","That is me----"
"Senator Levin","I know it is. Who is Tom Montag?"
"Mr. Sparks","Tom Montag was the head of the division at the time."
"Senator Levin","And he was telling you on June 22, ``Boy, that Timberwolf was one shi**y deal.'' And then you got Exhibit 166, a series of emails pushing the Goldman sales force to sell Timberwolf securities. The first is a June 26, 2007, email from GS Syndicate. That is your sales force. The sales force is told in Exhibit 166, ``Please focus on the CDO axes below,'' one of which is Timberwolf. The next email, take a look, July 1, 2007, tells the sales force the top priority is Timberwolf. The next email is July 24, 2007. Timberwolf is again listed as one of the top priorities. Next is an email, July 3, still after ``the shi**y deal'' assessment, in which one of GS sales team leaders, Matthew Bieber, writes that, with regard to Timberwolf, ``I'm all over these guys.'' The last email, August 22, again, highlights Timberwolf as a top priority. So if you cannot give a clear answer to that one, Mr. Sparks, I do not think we are going to get too many clear answers from you. But I have taken much more than my time, and we are going to come back to you and to the others on my second round. I will turn to Senator Collins."
"Senator Collins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start my questioning by asking each of you a fundamental question. Investment advisers have a legal obligation to act in the best interests of their clients. Mr. Sparks, when you were working at Goldman, did you consider yourself to have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I had a duty to act in a very straightforward way, in a very open way with my clients. Technically, with respect to investment advice, we were a market maker in that regard. But with respect to being a prudent and a responsible participant in the market, we do have a duty to do that."
"Senator Collins","OK. You are not really answering my question. I understand the difference between suitability standards, which you did have to follow, versus a fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of your clients. I understand that you do not have a legal fiduciary obligation, but did the firm expect you to act in the best interests of your clients as opposed to acting in the best interests of the firm?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, when I was at Goldman Sachs, clients are very important and were very important, and so----"
"Senator Collins","Could I--I am starting to share the Chairman's frustration already, and I am only 30 seconds into my time. Could you give me a yes or no to whether or not you considered yourself to have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients?"
"Mr. Sparks","I believe we have a duty to serve our clients well."
"Senator Collins","I guess, Mr. Chairman, that I am not going to get an answer to my question any more than you did with yours. Mr. Birnbaum, I am going to ask you the same question. Do you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Not only do I believe that we do, I believe that we did."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Swenson?"
"Mr. Swenson","I believe it is our responsibility as market makers to provide a market-level bid and offer to our clients and to serve our clients and helping them transact at levels that are fair market prices and help meet their needs."
"Senator Collins","Your clients are not paying you big fees just to efficiently conduct transactions. I have never seen an investment bank run ads that brag about its facility with conducting transactions. They are paying you for judgment as well. Mr. Tourre, same question for you. Do you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients?"
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, I believe we have a duty to serve our clients, and as our role--with respect to our role as market maker, to show prices to our clients and to offer them liquidity. I do not believe we were acting as investment advisers for our clients."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Tourre, you are giving the same kind of answer that Mr. Sparks did. I understand that you are serving your clients. Do you believe that you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients?"
"Mr. Tourre","Again, Senator, I will repeat, we have a duty to serve our clients by showing prices on transactions that they ask us to show prices for."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Birnbaum, since you are the only one who answered the question and you said yes, do you think that since there is apparently some confusion or some difference of opinion on this issue, do you think that Congress should impose a clear fiduciary obligation to act in the best interests of your clients on broker-dealers?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","First, I want to clarify. I worked with these gentlemen for years, and I think they share my sentiments on this issue, even if that is not what you are getting out of it right now."
"Senator Collins","Well, I think they spoke for themselves. But why don't you answer my current question?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Your current question is a regulatory question?"
"Senator Collins","I am asking you, since we are considering financial regulatory reform, should we amend the law to impose a clear fiduciary duty on broker-dealers to act in the best interests of their clients similar to the legal requirement that is already imposed on investment advisers?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think conceptually that does not seem like an issue. I am not completely familiar with how that works, but conceptually it seems like an interesting idea."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Tourre, I would like to ask you about a specific email, and it is Exhibit 61 in your exhibit book,\1\ if you could turn to that.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 61, which appears in the Appendix on page 471.  This is an email that you wrote on December 28, 2006, and it referred to a list of the clients that might be most profitable in the coming year. And you referred to this list, and you are not happy with this list because you believe that the list is skewed towards sophisticated hedge funds. You implied that the list should include fewer sophisticated hedge funds, and it goes on to say, ``with which we should not expect to make too much money since (a) most of the time they will be on the same side of the trade as we will, and (b) they know exactly how things work and will not let us work for too much vs. buy-and-hold rating-based buyers who we should be focused on a lot more to make incremental  next year.'' This sounds like a deliberate attempt to sell your products to less sophisticated clients who would not understand the products as well so that you could make more money. Would you like to comment on that?"
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, would you mind telling me where exactly--I just do not see it."
"Senator Collins","Well, it is on the bottom of Exhibit 61. It is very clear. It is an email to you. It is the last paragraph on that page."
"Mr. Tourre","Sorry. Which date?"
"Senator Collins","It is Exhibit 61. It is your December 28, 2006, email, and it is at the bottom of the page."
"Mr. Tourre","I see that email."
"Senator Collins","OK."
"Mr. Tourre","Can you repeat your question, Senator?"
"Senator Collins","Mr. Chairman, I cannot help but get the feeling that a strategy of the witnesses is to try to burn through the time of each questioner. Mr. Tourre, the email that you sent on December 28, 2006, refers to a list of potential clients that might be most profitable in the coming year, and you say that the list should include fewer ``sophisticated hedge funds with which we should not expect to make too much money since (a) most of the time they will be on the same side of the trade as we will, and (b) they know exactly how things work and will not let us work for too much . . . .'' And you refer instead to another kind of buyer, ``buy-and-hold rating-based buyers,'' who you can make more money from because they have less sophistication. This sounds like a deliberate strategy to sell products, complex products to less sophisticated clients who would not understand the products as well so that you can make more money?"
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, I will try to answer your question with two separate parts. One, I do not think I was expressing our ability to make more money from rating-based clients by saying that they were less sophisticated. As far as I can read this email today, what I think I was expressing was the fact that hedge funds have a tendency to usually argue very much about prices, and, with respect to our role as market maker, the money we make is bid- offer spread on transactions where we buy and we sell. So I think what I was expressing in that email was that with respect to ratings-based clients, they had a tendency to argue less about bid-offer spread than hedge fund clients. And the second part of the answer that I wanted to make clear is all the clients we did business with on the CDO desk, including ACA and IKB, which we probably will talk about separately, were highly sophisticated institutions which were also falling in the sort of ratings-based buyer category."
"Senator Collins","Well, Mr. Tourre, that is not how it reads to me. It reads to me that you wanted to deal with people who did not ``know exactly how things work'' and would allow you to make more money, and that raises the whole issue of whether you are truly disclosing all the information that you should be to your clients and whether your clients are aware that the whole system seems to be rife with conflicts of interest. Mr. Birnbaum, I want to ask you a question about an exhibit. It is Exhibit 104,\1\ and I am going to describe it. I realize that is a big exhibit book, although it is well ordered.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 104, which appears in the Appendix on page 673.  On July 25, 2007, the CFO of Goldman wrote an email to the Goldman president, and in that email the CFO responded to an update on mortgage-related investments that had declined in value and wrote, ``Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big short.''"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Excuse me. Are you on Exhibit 104?"
"Senator Collins","I apologize. It is Exhibit 26,\2\ top of the page, ``Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big short.''  \2\ See Exhibit No. 26, which appears in the Appendix on page 306.  There was also an October 29----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Was that a question or----"
"Senator Collins","I am getting to the question. It is a 2007 internal Goldman presentation that seems to confirm that the company took the big short position, and that document asserts that early in 2007, Goldman's mortgage trading desk ``started putting on big short positions.''"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Which exhibit is that?"
"Senator Collins","That is Exhibit 48.\3\  \3\ See Exhibit No. 48, which appears in the Appendix on page 376.  Mr. Birnbaum, this is my point: We have an email from the CFO that talks about people who had lost money that says, ``Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big short.'' We have an internal Goldman presentation that refers to starting to put on big short positions. And yet Goldman executives, this panel, and the testimony to come have stated repeatedly that Goldman never had an overall strategy to short mortgage-related investments. If Goldman's position were truly to just get back to home, to remain as neutral as possible, how do you account for all of these references to the big short?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think the first thing to clarify is I was not on the first email that you are referring to, so I would be interpreting David Viniar's words in that case. And I think in the other exhibit you mentioned--I do not know if it was Exhibit 48 or what it was, but that departmental presentation, I did not prepare that. I do not think I was on that email either. I just want to clarify. My position here was I had a role in the ABS Group. The ABS Group was a part of the Structured Products Group, which was a part of the Mortgage Department, which was a part of the firm. So my role was a--I had a singular voice, and I mentioned in my presentation, I had a view, I took a view, and that was not necessarily the view of the department or the firm, and that did not reflect the position necessarily for the department or the firm. And if you are asking me to interpret this email, again, I was not on this, so I would be speculating as to what these people meant."
"Senator Collins","Well, Mr. Chairman, I think it is very clear what the Goldman executives meant, and I, too, am baffled that they continue to maintain that they did not have an overall net short position, particularly seeing the chart that you put out.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 162, which appears in the Appendix on page 997. "
"Mr. Birnbaum","Do you mind if I comment on that chart for a moment? Because I saw a similar chart last week while interviewing with your staff, and I think that chart is, at best, misleading. That chart is an amalgam of positions that cannot necessarily--they are apples and oranges being added up together that do not reflect the firm's position or the firm's profit and loss statement to the extent the market would go up or down. And the analogy that I used with your staff last week--and I will use it again--would be if you were to trade, say, $100 in Johnson & Johnson versus $100 in Google, if you were to trade those against each other--so let us say you were long $100 in Google and you were short $100 in Johnson & Johnson, if you added those two together, they would look like a zero on a chart like that. But I think anybody who knows those two stocks would know that the person who has that position would not be indifferent as to which way the market would go. The Google position would be much more sensitive than the Johnson & Johnson position. That chart is an amalgam of AAAs, BBBs, As, very different things being added together that do not reflect the firm's P&L."
"Senator Collins","Mr. Chairman, it seems to me that the documents that you have compiled, that your staff has compiled, tell a very different story. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","By the way, before you proceed, Senator Kaufman, let me just assure Senator Collins and all the other Members of our Subcommittee and our witnesses that we are going to stay here as long as it takes to get the answers. So there may be a strategy. I noticed very much the same thing that Senator Collins did about the refusal to give answers, the long delays in those answers. But it is not going to work. We are going to stay here as long as it takes to get this information before the public."
"Senator Kaufman",""
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Sparks, can you tell us, do you know what a stated income loan is?"
"Mr. Sparks","I am generally familiar. That term could be used--at least I do not think that term is a technical term, but that term could be used with respect to certain ways loans were originated and how income by the borrower was represented."
"Senator Kaufman","Well, we had 3 days of hearings and had folks from Washington Mutual, regulators, and the rating agencies. They all seemed to know what a stated income loan is. Mr. Birnbaum, do you know what a stated income loan is?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think it is just what it sounds like."
"Senator Kaufman","Which is?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","My understanding--and I think there are some people who are more qualified to answer this question than me. But my understanding is that is when the borrower stated his income rather than being verified."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Mr. Swenson, is that your understanding?"
"Mr. Swenson","I agree."
"Senator Kaufman","Are you aware that stated income loans were originally for high-net-worth incomes, Mr. Sparks, but were beginning to spread throughout the mortgage industry? You were not concerned about stated income loans at all or the fact that they were stated income loans going out and being used to determine whether loans should be given to borrowers?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I was aware that that business activity from the mortgage originators was growing."
"Senator Kaufman","Did that cause you any concern?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, we operate in the markets, and the prices in this instance where we would probably see that is if the loan originator that is a client of ours wanted to sell assets, that was their objective, we would factor that in to what we did with respect to pricing and diligence and the like."
"Senator Kaufman","So the fact that some of your mortgage originators were presenting mortgages to you for securitization that were stated income loans--remember, a stated income loan is a case where you walk in and you say, ``Mr. Sparks, what is your income?'' You tell me what it is, that is the end of the road. No W-2 form, no checking. That is it. So as this went on, you became concerned that this was growing?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Senator, I was just saying that I had knowledge of it. I was not making a judgment about the practice."
"Senator Kaufman","Sure. What do you think about the practice?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, we were not a big originator."
"Senator Kaufman","But you did securitize----"
"Mr. Sparks","I believe we securitized some of that. I think that type of loan has a risk to it that when it is verified has a different risk to it."
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Can I say that one of the regulators said at the hearing we had earlier that it was anathema to the banking business. The idea that someone could come in and just based on what they say, their word could be used for these loans would be an anathema."
"Mr. Sparks","Again, Senator, we were not a big originator in this space. We were not a big originator of that product."
"Senator Kaufman","But you securitized these loans, right?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes."
"Senator Kaufman","Yes, you did. And do you know whether Goldman was securitizing WaMu mortgages or Long Beach mortgages at this time?"
"Mr. Sparks","WaMu, Long Beach is and was a client of Goldman Sachs."
"Senator Kaufman","And in May 2006, Goldman Sachs acted as co-lead underwriter with WaMu to securitize $532 million in subprime second-lien, fixed-rate mortgages originated at Long Beach? Does that sound reasonable to you?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Senator."
"Senator Kaufman","What would you think if you heard that-- what would be a reasonable percentage, do you think, of home equity loans that you would securitize that had stated income as the basis for income in those loans? What would be a reasonable number, do you think?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I am not familiar with the specifics of that deal, and in hindsight, those deals did not perform. So I do not know what a reasonable percentage would be. The deal would be what it was, and----"
"Senator Kaufman","Take a wild guess."
"Mr. Sparks","And it would be disclosed as to what it was."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. It was not disclosed, how much of these were stated income loans."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, with respect to the origination practices, those would have been disclosed."
"Senator Kaufman","But they would not be disclosed to the people who were buying your securitized mortgages. I guarantee they were not disclosed."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, with respect to the origination practices--and, again, I would have to look at the particular deal----"
"Senator Kaufman","We got the origination practices. What we are trying to do here today is talk about what happened after the originators got through with it and after the rating agencies put the rating on it and the rest of it and then it went out. There was this great sucking from Wall Street to get more and more of these loans into the marketplace, and you can see that it was an explosion. Is it fair to say there was an explosion in these CDOs and RMBSs?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Senator, when we participated in the market--and these deals are in the structured finance arena of the market."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Sparks","You would know from your participation in the market what types of investors wanted to buy what types of risk."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But you were selling--this is a product--this is a product you were selling. It is like selling a car----"
"Mr. Sparks","And there would be--and we would also know what types of investors wanted Long Beach or Washington Mutual loans to invest in, in securitized format. So we would know what investors actually had demand for that product."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But what percentage do you think would be a reasonable percentage--I mean, as you said, these all went bad. Ten thousand loans in 2006----"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know about all, but----"
"Senator Kaufman","Well, excuse me----"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I do not know what the right percentage would be."
"Senator Kaufman","Would you say 10 or 15 percent?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again, it depends on the deal, and I do not know."
"Senator Kaufman","Well, suppose I told you that in these deals that you were securitizing, 90 percent of the home equity loans were made on stated income. Would that be something that would cause you concern?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, this particular deal I think in hindsight was a second-lien subprime deal, so it did not perform well."
"Senator Kaufman","Would it concern you that the subprime deals, 50 percent of them are stated income loans?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again, I think that many of those deals that we brought did not perform well, and that is not a good thing for us or our clients."
"Senator Kaufman","But I mean, couldn't it be reasonable to believe that when the great preponderance of the mortgages in the package that you were selling to folks were stated income loans, there was a pretty good chance that a large percentage of these were eventually going to fail?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, at the time things happened in the market and were accepted in the market that in hindsight look very different than they did at the time in the market."
"Senator Kaufman","I got two things out of these hearings. One, nobody did anything wrong, this was a natural disaster, like a hurricane hit. The mortgage market fell, and nobody knew it, and nobody forecasted it. And the second thing is that these things were just something that happened. Basically, I am just saying if you did some research into this--and I am sure had people in your organization--they were coming in. These loans were pouring into your--you were sucking them in, in order to sell them and make money, which is entirely acceptable. Just a little bit of research into how these things were being funded--by the way, let me ask you: Did you ever have any concern during 2006 and 2007 that there were an awful lot of home mortgage loans being securitized?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Senator."
"Senator Kaufman","And did you ever say, ``I wonder what is going on with those loans''? I mean, ``I wonder how all these people are coming forward that are going to need these types of loans''?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, when I said I was concerned, I was concerned about risk that we had----"
"Senator Kaufman","Risk. That is what I mean. That is what I am saying. So normally due diligence--again, I think the argument that, ``Well, everybody was doing it,'' is an argument that has been used over the years. These halls are full of folks who have come before Senate committees and said, ``Well, everybody was doing it.'' So I do not think the ``everybody was doing it'' thing is going to hold up real well. And so I am just trying to figure out when--when I say this to people, I am telling you--and I say, ``Do you know what a stated income loan is? Do you know that you could just walk into a bank and tell them what your income was and they would give you a loan? And you know what happens next? They go to Wall Street''--and this is going to sound a little--I totally believe where some of the smartest people I know work, and you know what they did? They packaged these things up. Did they ever ask how many were stated income loans? I do not know. Did they ever ask, did anybody say let us take a look at how these loans are being put together? And stated income is just the easiest one to explain to people. Do you believe that they did this and no one knew, no one knew at Washington Mutual, no one knew at Standard & Poor's and Moody's, and no one knew at the premier investment banking house of the United States of America, Goldman Sachs?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I did not mean to imply that we did not know anything. We had a team that did diligence to understand originators and loan packages that we bought. But I would like to make the point----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Sparks","That that team may have liked that risk and, in fact, did. And on that deal----"
"Senator Kaufman","Liked the risk that somebody could go in and originate a loan just on their stated income that 90 percent--the stated income started out as something that was for high-wealth individuals. It was a very small percentage. But starting around 2005, 2006, it grew and grew and grew. But when you are talking about 90 percent of the prime home equity loans, 73 percent of the Option ARMs, and 50 percent of the subprime loans where the basis for income for the borrower is what they say their income is."
"Mr. Sparks","And, Senator, we made a number of poor business decisions, especially in hindsight, but at the time there were people in my business unit who actually wanted to be long that risk, and on that type of deal----"
"Senator Kaufman","They had no idea that the risk was 90 percent stated income loans. I do not think anybody knew that."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, I would have to look at the particular deal."
"Senator Kaufman","I mean, that is--I am just having a hard time--I am trying to put myself back in your position, which is always a difficult thing to do. But I see these mortgages pouring in. I would say: Where are they coming from? And especially the people in your operation who were originating these loans. The idea that you can get away with--I will get away with it and I am for it, you are just selling something and that is the way it is, and, they are taking the risk, and people want to buy these things. I do not think anybody in America wants to buy a mortgage from someone whose income is what they state their income can be. I do not think anybody wants to buy that. Is that fair?"
"Mr. Sparks","Today?"
"Senator Kaufman","No. Anytime."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, there were a lot of investors who had a lot of appetite in the period we are talking about, including a number of people in the firm and in my business unit. So I think hindsight and your own investment view is an example of why there are markets----"
"Senator Kaufman","Look, I hate hindsight, and I hate Monday morning quarterbacking, and I hate connecting the dots and connecting all this. So I do not--I really do not feel on this one that I am up here, using a morality that was developed in the last 15 minutes in order to ask you questions about this thing and embarrass you. That is not what I am about at all. And I do not think anybody in this room, if I polled them, would say that it is unreasonable to expect that when you are securitizing loans, that the idea that these loans are stated income loans is a problem. It is a problem in terms of risk. So that language works a lot of places, but I just do not think it works in these stated income loans. By the way, do you--and I guess this is really for the folks that worked for you down the line, but did you ever have a situation where you eliminated originators?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, and we had a number of situations where we just did not start doing business with originators. When you say eliminated,. I am assuming you mean stop doing business----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, the same thing, yes, either not do business----"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know, Senator, for sure about that. I do know that there were a number of originators that we chose not to do business with."
"Senator Kaufman","And do you know what was the standard for them? I mean, how did you get to be an originator? I mean, what were some of the criteria? Do you have any idea?"
"Mr. Sparks","How did we choose certain people to do business with and not do business with?"
"Senator Kaufman","Yes."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, our team would go out and anybody we bought loans from, we would do due diligence on. We would work to understand their origination guidelines and standards. We would also look at the institution itself with respect to their capital and what they did."
"Senator Kaufman","And Long Beach, you looked at Long Beach and said, ``Boy, that is a great originator. I would love to have them''? That is right here, Long Beach. You were doing Long Beach----"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, we did business----"
"Senator Kaufman","In 2006, 2007, and I am not going to get into the Long Beach thing because we do not have time to do it. But Long Beach was one of the main players in the stated income. I do not know how you could turn someone else down and accept Long Beach. I cannot ask you about a specific case because that is not your area of expertise. The Treasury Department Inspector General, Eric Thorson, testified before the Subcommittee that the mix of stated income loans from one originator of the numbers I gave you was a target-rich investment for fraud. What do you think about that? Do you think if you got these originators using stated income loans that it is a target-rich environment for fraud?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I think as the purchaser and assumer of risk from these originators, we suffered with respect to that. And so, I do not--that particular point I do not know that I have a particular view on, but it appears that there were a number that actually was the case in hindsight."
"Senator Kaufman","Yes, in--well, no. Do not do the hindsight thing with me. I mean, come on. In hindsight--at the time, if you knew at the time what was going on, you would say this is as target-rich investment for fraud, that 90 percent of the home equity loans are stated income loans, these things are just pouring out of these originators. I mean, I am not interested in new data. I am just talking about data that was available at the time. You would think that something was going on here when you have 90 percent of your loans stated income loans."
"Mr. Sparks","When we are buying loans, we do not want to buy loans with fraud in them."
"Senator Kaufman","Exactly. No, I know that. I am just saying that this information--do you know anything about thin files? Have you ever heard the term ``thin files''?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I may have heard it. I do not really recall the specifics of it."
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Birnbaum, do you know anything about thin files?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think I read something about that recently in ``The Big Short.''"
"Senator Kaufman","So you understand what thin files are, but you did not know----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","It is detailed in the book."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. Did anybody at Goldman Sachs ever use thin files in putting together CDOs, the thin-file approach?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, just to be clear, my job function had nothing to do with putting together CDOs, so I cannot speak to that."
"Senator Kaufman","In terms of securities----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Thin files is something I literally heard of for the first time last week."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. And, Mr. Swenson, as far as you know, Goldman Sachs never used the thin-file approach in order to make more--organizing CDOs?"
"Mr. Swenson","No."
"Senator Kaufman","And, Mr. Sparks?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again, I am not familiar with the approach, but if you described it to me, I would be happy to----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, I mean, if you did not hear of it, then clearly you did not use the process, it is fair to say. I mean, you never heard about it in Goldman Sachs, anyone ever doing anything like using this thin files specifically. And how about barbelling? Mr. Sparks, have you ever heard of barbelling?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I have heard of barbelling mainly with respect to trading positions."
"Senator Kaufman","Have you ever heard of barbelling with regard to RMBSs?"
"Mr. Sparks","That term could just mean a number of things, so could you----"
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Birnbaum, did you just read about it recently?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I will go with that."
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Swenson","I am not aware of that term."
"Senator Kaufman","What is alleged, what happened was people would take advantage of the fact that rating agencies went with an average. So what they would do with barbelling is they would go out and pick up FICO scores of 550, which are almost guaranteed to fail, mix them in with FICO scores of 650, so they came out with about 615 and then sold them. Mr. Sparks, you never heard of anything like that at Goldman Sachs, right?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I know that clients--or when we were putting deals together--the deal teams would work very hard to put together--whatever the loan package was, and work with the rating agencies to come up with what the capital structure would be. That includes credit enhancement. So I do not recall somebody coming to me saying, ``Hey, we are going to barbell this.''"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Sparks","But there would be a mix of collateral----"
"Senator Kaufman","Let me ask you a similar question then. How about gaming the rating agencies? Did you ever think there were people at Goldman Sachs sitting around trying to figure out, whether it is barbelling or thin files or something like that, trying to figure out what can we get through here, through the rating agencies?"
"Mr. Sparks","No. As far as gaming, no. As far as working with the agencies, to come up with a capital structure and a credit enhancement that worked for the deal, yes, there was constant dialogue and work together for that."
"Senator Kaufman","And, Mr. Birnbaum, dealing with rating agencies, did you ever get the feeling there were folks sitting around trying to figure out what is the best way to put this together for rating agencies so that we can make the most money on these RMBSs?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Just to be clear, I never deal with the rating agencies----"
"Senator Kaufman","Oh, you never did. Mr. Swenson, you never dealt with that either?"
"Mr. Swenson","No, I did not. We were secondary traders responsible for making markets in ABS securities."
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Sparks, how did you feel about dealing with the rating agencies? Did you ever feel like sometimes you might pick a rating agency based on--if you had two rating agencies, one would give you AAA and the other give you AA, that you might go with the AAA rating agency?"
"Mr. Sparks","There were times that that is correct, Senator."
"Senator Kaufman","And did you ever think there was kind of subtle pressure on the rating agencies that maybe they ought to rate something AAA?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I think the rating agencies worked very hard and were under a lot of pressure to analyze the pools that they were rating. So I think they were under a lot of pressure."
"Senator Kaufman","They were under a lot of pressures in order to keep market share and in order to keep their business alive, so, therefore, they had to rate competitively against the other rating agencies. Is that a fair assumption of what is going on?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I think there was some competitiveness to it, but I also--I felt like the rating agencies attempted to do their job and worked hard at it. I think there was some component of competitiveness in it, but I think they were honestly trying to do their job and rate the deals."
"Senator Kaufman","Mr. Tourre, you have dealt with rating agencies, right?"
"Mr. Tourre","I did, Senator."
"Senator Kaufman","And how did you find the rating agencies? Did you ever work with them in such a way as to try to turn AA into AAA?"
"Mr. Tourre","I merely applied their rating models--they had, a lot of documentation about how they rate, all these transactions, and we merely applied those models to rate our products."
"Senator Kaufman","So under oath you are saying you were never involved in any gaming like barbelling or thin file or anything like that?"
"Mr. Tourre","Well, each transaction had its specific aspects that require discussions with the rating agencies."
"Senator Kaufman","No, I am just saying, but during those discussions you never at Goldman Sachs ever engaged in what is popularly known as barbelling or thin files in order to come up with a security?"
"Mr. Tourre","First, I do not know what thin files was, and I--not that I remember."
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much. Dr. Coburn. "
"OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR COBURN"," "
"Senator Coburn","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to take my privilege as Ranking Member to make my opening statement now, and I apologize to the panel that I was not here. I am working on another financial problem that is a little bit bigger than this one with the White House and the Debt Commission. Senator Levin, I want to thank you for this fourth and final hearing. I want to thank the staffs. I think they have worked well together, and I think we have done a good role of putting forward what the questions are. I also want to thank the witnesses for making themselves available to answer our questions. The hearing to me is particularly important because this week the Senate is trying to consider major financial reform legislation that could have profound effects on our economy. And we are hurrying these hearings. The Commission that the Congress commissioned to study this that is going to have a report due in December is not going to have a report, and yet we are going to pass a bill before we find everything, and that is somewhat concerning to me. But, nevertheless, there is a lot of evidence in front of us that needs to be clarified. In recent months, Congress and the American people have been debating the causes of our financial crisis and looking for solutions. Mr. Chairman, I commend you for advancing the discussion with our investigations of institutions like Washington Mutual, the Federal regulators, and particularly the Office of Thrift Supervision. We would have been fine without them ever being there because they actually did not do anything. What we have learned is that there are no easy answers. This is important to keep in mind when Congress debates major legislation. I certainly have my own views about what caused the financial crisis, but most honest observers would acknowledge that the roads of responsibilities lead to places like Washington and Congress as well as Wall Street. We also cannot forget that there are numerous causes to the financial crisis, not just one. In truth, we all took turns inflating the housing bubble. Today we are looking at the role of one investment bank, Goldman Sachs. My goal is simply to uncover the truth of what happened in several of these transactions. If we can understand this piece of the puzzle, we will be in a much better position to craft responsible legislation that addresses the real problem, not the symptoms of the problem. And more importantly, the American people will be better informed and more equipped to hold us accountable. The investigation into Goldman Sachs has given the Subcommittee an opportunity to dive into the firm's decisions regarding mortgage investments. Even though Goldman Sachs is the focus, I would suggest that the questions we are going to ask the witnesses today should also be asked of other leading investment banks. Congress has a responsibility to understand how widespread some of these complex financial transactions may be and the ethics and motivations behind them. The key question before us, I believe, is whether Goldman Sachs was making proprietary trades that were contrary to the financial interests of their customers. Sorting out these potential conflicts is central to understanding how we move forward with financial reform and also understanding that there is a role for a market maker who plays both sides of the market. And we cannot lose sight of that. Several instances, however, seem to show bankers and traders were focused on doing what was right for the firm rather than what was in the best interest of their clients. In an exchange over the Abacus deal, one employee remarked, ``The way I look at it, the easiest managers to work with should be used for our own priorities. Managers that are a bit more difficult should be used for trades like Paulson.'' Goldman employees knew that such tactics could hurt their reputation if they were uncovered. Markets can be complex, but they are built on three simple concepts: Truth, trust, and transparency. Without them, the cost of doing business is too high, and markets cannot function properly. I have several questions about these deliberations within Goldman Sachs. I am committed to withholding final judgment until all our hearings are complete. Some of what we uncovered paints a fairly dark picture of what was going on inside investment banks. To the witnesses, I would say this is your opportunity to explain to us and the American people what happened. And, again, I thank you for being here. Now I would like to move to my questions, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Swenson, if you would, would you turn to Exhibit 55b?\1\ This is a copy of your own performance evaluation for 2007, and I want to spend some time with you on that, with your own self-assessment, and I have some questions. You wrote this document, I believe. What was the purpose of this document?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 55b, which appears in the Appendix on page 441. "
"Mr. Swenson","The purpose of this document was to go over my accomplishments for that year."
"Senator Coburn","OK. You say, ``It should not be a surprise to anyone that the 2007 year is the one that I am most proud of to date. I can take credit for recognizing the enormous opportunity for the ABS synthetics business 2 years ago.'' You go on to say that you identified ``key market dislocations that led to tremendous profits.'' Is that an accurate representation?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, it is."
"Senator Coburn","Later in this document, you run through some of your biggest trades, including a $1.8 billion short on CDOs, collateralized debt obligations, and you say you oversaw and directed the covering of $9 billion in short positions. Is it accurate to say that you went extremely short and made a lot of money?"
"Mr. Swenson","Dr. Coburn, you were not here for my opening statement. I went over a number of the trades that we did and a timeline and a series of trades that we did over the course of 2006 and 2007. So for others in the room, I am sorry I am repeating myself a little, but we did a number of trades in 2006 and 2007 that made us put our ABS Desk specifically net short at various times with a short bias and at times flat, and we added a significant amount of risk where we went long at the end of the first quarter. Throughout the second quarter, we added a lot of risk, net long positions. And in the third quarter, at one point we had a short bias, and we covered a substantial amount of risk over the course of that quarter into the end of August."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you. But you did in 2007 go much more short than you were in 2006. Is that an accurate statement?"
"Mr. Swenson","It is----"
"Senator Coburn","Because of what you saw in the market. I am not critical of it. That is your job as a market maker: To read the tea leaves. I am not being critical. I am just saying you had a stronger short position in 2007 than you did in 2006."
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, we did."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Mr. Birnbaum in his review writes, ``I consider myself to be initial or primary driver of the macro trading direction for the business.'' Would you agree with this statement?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Is there----"
"Senator Coburn","I am asking this to Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Oh."
"Mr. Swenson","I viewed our business as being market makers for ABS securities."
"Senator Coburn","All right. But the question I am asking you: Do you agree with Mr. Birnbaum's statement in writing in his review, he said, ``I consider myself to be the initial or primary driver of the macro trading direction for the business.'' Do you agree with that?"
"Mr. Swenson","I do not know the context of those particular words. Is it in a document here, sir?"
"Senator Coburn","Yes, we can get that for you. Mr. Birnbaum, what do you think? You wrote it. The reason I am asking the question, you seem to have--in your own self- assessment, you are both taking credit for the same thing. And I am wanting to know who is the driver here. Who made the decision?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","We worked as a team."
"Senator Coburn","Well, you worked as a team, but somebody leads the team. Who led the team?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","We worked as a team"
"Senator Coburn","Who led the team? Who was the leader of your team?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Are you implying that you can only have one person leading teams?"
"Senator Coburn","Well, you only have one Lloyd Blankfein, right? He is the CEO. So in terms of your team, who has the line responsibility for your team?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Mr. Swenson was my superior."
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Swenson","And ultimately Mr. Sparks."
"Senator Coburn","OK. So there was a leader. Somebody is ultimately responsible, correct."
"Mr. Swenson","Correct."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Birnbaum says he had his own plan implemented by buying up ``almost every single name CDO protection . . . opportunity in a 2-month period.'' Is that the same thing that you were taking credit for, Mr. Swenson?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes. We worked together on the same desk."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Swenson, you also say in this assessment that it was clear to you in the early summer of 2006 that ``the market fundamentals in subprime and the highly levered nature of CDOs was going to have a very unhappy ending.'' That is a quote from your self-assessment. Did you share that knowledge with anybody else at the firm other than those who read your self-assessment?"
"Mr. Swenson","Sir, do you mind pointing exactly where this quote was so I----"
"Senator Coburn","It is in your self-assessment."
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, I understand, but what page?"
"Senator Coburn","I will get it to you here in a second. We will move on while----"
"Mr. Swenson","I am just trying to be helpful, sir."
"Senator Coburn","Let us assume--I will get you where that was stated, all right? And my staff will find that and we will give it to you. It is on Exhibit 55b, on page 2, is where you made that statement. Single-name CDO short. Did you share that with other members of the firm other than those who read your self-assessment?"
"Mr. Swenson","No."
"Senator Coburn","You were obviously correct, weren't you, in your assessment?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Given your awareness, were you concerned that your mortgage division continued to market and sell mortgage-related CDOs to the firm's clients? You are sitting here projecting what you see happening in the market. Was there any concern that you were continuing to market into a market that looked like it was declining and you were recommending taking a position against it?"
"Mr. Swenson","Dr. Coburn, at that time in the summer of 2006 and into 2007, the market was going up in price. We were very long ABS assets and ABX single-name synthetics at that time. The market for the underlying securities in RMBS transactions was generally very tight and very robust with deals oversubscribed. So at that time, there was a great deal of demand for securities, and there were not many players that had a negative view on the product or the housing market in 2006 that were buying a lot of these securities. Those views changed, but over time there was a great deal of debate on the direction of the mortgage market. All through the third and fourth quarter, there were opportunities when prices went down, and it brought in a tremendous amount of demand for people to buy securities at lower prices. No one was certain that these things were going to happen."
"Senator Coburn","No, I agree with that, and I can appreciate it. But part of your expertise was in terms of you put that in as a statement of qualifications of a great job that you had done that year because you recognized the potential for it. So let me go back. The statement was ``the market fundamentals in subprime and the highly leveraged nature of CDOs was going to have a very unhappy ending.'' That is your quote. And so I go back. Did you share that, your feeling that you put in your own self-assessment, with other principals at the firm?"
"Mr. Swenson","We debated the direction of the market as a group all the time. I mean, there were a number of traders on our ABS Desk. There were, five or six, and we discussed the nature of the performance of the underlying transactions. At that time our desk was long."
"Senator Coburn","But you had sold $1.8 billion in short CDOs."
"Mr. Swenson","Not at that point. Over time that position through our market making and principaling was put on--not in September 2006."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Go to Exhibit 69,\1\ if you would. And while you are looking for that, I want to follow up on something Senator Kaufman asked. You packaged and sold mortgage-backed securities from Long Beach that were AAA rated that the vast majority of them were stated income loans. Is that an accurate statement?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 69, which appears in the Appendix on page 486. "
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know the number percentage-wise, Dr. Coburn, but that is possible."
"Senator Coburn","Well, it was well over 50 percent. We know the number."
"Mr. Sparks","We did a number of deals with Long Beach."
"Senator Coburn","And so going back to follow up on what Senator Kaufman said, the rating agencies rated these AAA in spite of the fact on their due diligence they should have known that the majority were stated income loans."
"Mr. Sparks","Dr. Coburn, yes, and--well, I do not know exactly what they knew. It would have been determined under the diligence they did. But I will tell you, Goldman Sachs also many times invested in the equity of those deals."
"Senator Coburn","I understand. Everything can be invested in if the price is right compared to the risk. I am not disputing that. But I am going back to the question that you have AAA rating on stated income loans, on packages you put together to underwrite. Correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Now, Mr. Swenson, again, Exhibit 69. In October 2007, Goldman Sachs made quite a bit of money when Moody's credit rating agency downgraded $32 billion in BBB and BBB-minus bonds. After you send this email informing your colleagues of those downgrades, Donald Mullen emails you and says, ``Sounds like we will make some serious money.'' Why was that?"
"Mr. Swenson","Just give me one second to read the context of the email."
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Swenson","Sorry. "
"Mr. Swenson","This email specifically goes over a position in a single-name CDO, ABS CDO synthetic that we have. What happened was when the rating agencies downgraded a number of the underlying RMBS securities, it triggered an event which would mean that we would end up with an implied write down event which would shut off the coupons in a number of the tranches--or one of the tranches that we were short on. So we would not need to pay our protection payment on that security and eventually recoup the gains on that trade."
"Senator Coburn","And I am not stating that there is anything wrong to hedging your long position. Do not get me wrong. I guess the thing that I would ask: Did you at any time see any flaws in the rating agencies' assessment of the products that you were putting out there?"
"Mr. Swenson","Dr. Coburn, I did not work on the construction of CDOs. I was a market maker in ABS securities, and as a market maker, we are asked to take principal risk from our clients, whether it is a buy or a sell, at various times. With that, it is for us to manage our risk as principal because clients expect us to transact at the time that they come to us and ask to transact, not wait for us to find the other side. So as principal, we manage that by incorporating a view or a bias in the way we position ourselves."
"Senator Coburn","Let us say somebody brought to you another package that you were making a market in. And you are making a market for a product that absolutely stinks. You know it stinks. The rating agency knows it stinks. Would Goldman still make a market in that if the money could be made off of it by the client and Goldman?"
"Mr. Swenson","We bid on--our requirement for our desk is to bid on ABS securities. When clients come to us, we try to give--we give the market value bid or the offer for that security."
"Senator Coburn","So you are a true market maker. So even if it is the worst possible combination of securities, there is a price at which the risk is worth taking. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Swenson","That is correct."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Mr. Tourre, I know it is a difficult time for you. In addition to the SEC accusations against you and the media circus around you, this past weekend your employer released some rather embarrassing personal emails from you that appear to be largely unrelated to this or any other investigation. Do you have any feelings or questions about why that was done?"
"Mr. Tourre","Dr. Coburn, these emails were personal emails that I deeply regret. They reflect----"
"Senator Coburn","I am not making a judgment on it. I am asking you a question. Do you have any thought about the motivation on why they were released?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not know, sir."
"Senator Coburn","How did it make you feel when they were released publicly?"
"Mr. Tourre","As I will repeat again, Dr. Coburn, I regret, these emails. They reflect very bad on the firm and on myself, and, I think, I wish I had not sent those."
"Senator Coburn","Is there a large number of in-house Goldman lawyers that have spoken with you prior to this hearing?"
"Mr. Tourre","I have spoken to lawyers prior to this hearing, yes."
"Senator Coburn","How many?"
"Mr. Tourre","I don't remember."
"Senator Coburn","Several?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","It is true that they have hired an interpreter, a French interpreter, to translate for reporters personal notes you had written to close friends? Is that true?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not know."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Are you personally represented by lawyers paid for by Goldman Sachs?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Mr. Chairman, my time is up."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Dr. Coburn. Senator McCaskill."
"Senator McCaskill","I want to make clear that I understand that for most of these transactions we are talking about today you considered yourself a market maker. And by that, you were trying to allow clients to bet on a certain outcome. And for purposes of my questions today, I would like to limit this to synthetic CDOs because I think they are the best representative of why most of America does understand what happened. We are not talking about a farmer trying to get certainty on a commodity. We are not talking about an airline company trying to get certainty on jet fuel, which is the societal reason that we have market makers to put predictability into a business model that will allow more informed risk taking as it relates to a business model. But the synthetic CDOs were really about somebody just wanting to place a bet, and so I want to try to continue with the analogy of you being the house or the bookie. Most people in America understand about a football bet. I have usually bet on MU versus KU because I went to MU and I care about MU. But the line is important. Obviously, if you are going to be a serious bettor, you have got to know what the line is. You have got to know how many points you are going to get or how many points you are going to give. And that is, I think, where we can start drawing the analogies to your jobs. You were trying to make a market, and staying close to home was trying to get the line right. Staying close to home was to not be too far out on one side or the other. When the bookie gets too many bets on MU, if MU is getting points, it gives fewer points to MU to move more bettors over to KU and vice versa. The bookie moves the line in order to even out the bets. So the perfect bookie who makes a lot of money is somebody who just gets the vig. And depending on whether you are betting in an office pool that is illegal or whether you are betting in Las Vegas, the vig is going to vary anywhere from 5 to 10 percent. I do not know who the right person is to ask this--what is your vig, Mr. Sparks, on these deals? What is the vig you make, assuming all you are doing--not playing in the market, but all you are doing is trying to stay close to home like a bookie would try to do in order to minimize their risk?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, can I just, instead of using the bookie analogy, just talk about--I think your question about profits and what we can make as a client----"
"Senator McCaskill","I want to know, generally speaking, the vig on a bookie bet. You are the house. You are the bookie. People are booking their bets with you. That is what they are doing. That is what a synthetic CDO is. I do not know why we need to dress it up. It is just a bet. That is all it is."
"Mr. Sparks","There is fee business, which I do not think is what you are talking about, and then there is market-making business. In this particular sector, typically you would have to do trades where you assumed risk. When that was not the case, there is an SEC markup rule with respect to a certain percentage, but that is for risk-free trades, and at this time in this market, that was not a typical thing where you would have a purely risk-free trade. The amount of bid-offer spread, which would be a term we would have used, would be very dependent on the product, the rating, the liquidity of the product, and the--if I did not mention liquidity, it was a huge issue. So, the bid-offer spread could vary at various times, but one of the things people expected us to do was to make a market and to have a bid-offer spread. The great thing about making a market is when you do that, clients can tell from your price relative to the prices that other people are making in that market on similar securities, if you are a better seller or buyer. And so, I actually--I am a believer in markets, and I think that is one of the nice things that price can affect, both your risk and it can also help people know where to go if they want to acquire risk."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Let us talk about what people are betting on. And what I would like to ask a couple of questions about are the--you call them different things in different memorandums in here, whether it is Timberwolf or Abacus--the asset selector or the asset selecting agent. I think you called it a different term. Now, this is important because these are the folks that are figuring out what is going to be in the bet, right? What everybody is betting on. So the compilation of what is in this thing you create for people to bet on is done by these asset selectors. Who decides who the asset selector is for a deal?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, in CDOs or synthetic CDOs, there were a number of different forms, and that term, the importance was what the term was defined as. Typically, you would have or you may have a manager for a CDO, and that manager----"
"Senator McCaskill","But let me ask specifically because you are going to get off on--let me ask, who decided who the asset selector was on Timberwolf? What person in your organization would decide who the asset selector is on Timberwolf?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Timberwolf was--there is a client of Goldman Sachs called Greywolf, and they are an asset manager and had a desire to grow their assets under management. By being CDO manager, that is one way for them to do that. And we worked with them to help them with respect to growing their assets under management. So we would have chosen that client to do that deal with."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Who would have chosen the--I think in the Abacus it was called the portfolio selection agent. Who chose ACA in Abacus? Who chose ACA?"
"Mr. Tourre","If I may answer, Senator, in the Abacus 07 AC-1 transaction, it was a combination of Goldman Sachs and Paulson who selected ACA."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Now, this is weird. This is where people do not get this. This is where I do not get it, and this is where a lot of the anger and passion and energy is coming from. Paulson came to you and said: I want to make a bet. I want to go short on all these really bad mortgage loans that are out there that are all going to start going belly up. You want to help him make a market, right? Is that correct,"
"Mr. Tourre?",""
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. So he comes to you and says: I am your customer, and I want to bet short. Now, the weird thing is--I read your statement carefully, and you parsed your words. You said, ``I recall informing ACA that Paulson's fund was expected to buy credit protection on some of the senior tranches of the AC-1 transaction.'' Well, why wouldn't you just tell them we are doing this because Paulson wants to go short?"
"Mr. Tourre","I worded this carefully, one, because I do not remember the exact words I used."
"Senator McCaskill","OK."
"Mr. Tourre","And, two, because we were not sure at that time which tranches Paulson was expecting to buy protection on. And, three, because Goldman Sachs ultimately was not under any obligation to resell protection to Paulson. It could decide to keep that risk position for itself."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. So here is the weird thing. What is Paulson doing in the room with the guy picking the assets? Why is Paulson even in the room much less meeting with them without you there? Was IKB there?"
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, in----"
"Senator McCaskill","Answer my question. Was IKB there?"
"Mr. Tourre","No."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. And was IKB going to be a bettor, too?"
"Mr. Tourre","IKB was going to be--well, at which point in time, Senator?"
"Senator McCaskill","When they were deciding--when Paulson, who came to you to place a bet, and you put him in the room with the folks that were going to decide what they were betting on."
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, at----"
"Senator McCaskill","Who put him in the room?"
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, at that time, we had not discussed with IKB, this investment yet."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. So when you did discuss the investment with IKB, did you say we had a client--by the way, we are the house, we are supposed to be the bookie, but you need to know that we decided to let the client who wanted to bet against this deal, we decided to put them in the room with the people who were picking what was going to go in it? Did you tell IKB that?"
"Mr. Tourre","I did not tell IKB about the existence of Paulson."
"Senator McCaskill","And do you see how that seems weird?"
"Mr. Tourre","Well, IKB knew that this was a synthetic CDO transaction for which by construction there was both----"
"Senator McCaskill","I just need somebody to acknowledge that that seems weird, that one side is coming to you wanting to place a bet short. You put them in the room with the people you decide are going to pick what is in the deal to bet short on, and the people you sell the transaction to that you want to sell an equity position in never gets to know that Paulson is in the room picking the stuff. That just seems bizarre to me."
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, if I may say a couple of things. One, ultimately ACA selected the reference portfolio, so there were suggestions from many different parties."
"Senator McCaskill","Were they in the room with them or just Paulson? I do not think anybody was ever in the room but Paulson, were they, Mr. Tourre, really, honestly? I mean, let us be honest here. This was a Paulson deal. You were trying-- and you put ACA in there as some kind of fig leaf so you could do exactly what you are doing now and say ACA was a reputable firm and they had all this CDO experience. Why didn't you use ACA on any of the other deals? Why did you use--you know what the interesting thing is on Timberwolf? You know who Greywolf is? It is all your alumni. It is the former guys that sat at your desks. They are all Goldman Sachs people on the Greywolf deal. Why didn't you take any warehouse position on Abacus as you did on Timberwolf?"
"Mr. Tourre","We were left with unsold risk in the Abacus 07 AC-1 transaction, Senator."
"Senator McCaskill","Yes, I know. I mean, here is the thing. You have got these two transactions--and, by the way, they are very close in time, OK? One is March and one is April. And I-- well, maybe I will take some time to go through them. Let me go through some of the Timberwolf documents because--and I am not going to have you look at them because it takes too long if you look at them. I am going to make representations to you that I am going to read directly out of the documents, and then the record will bear out that I am reading directly out of the document, because I think it is important to get a sense of this."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, can I make a point that might be helpful on disclosure in this sector?"
"Senator McCaskill","Yes."
"Mr. Sparks","These securities are backed by assets. There are years and years of input that regulators, internal and external counsel, and investors and market participants have had with respect to asset-backed securities."
"Senator McCaskill","You are talking about the assets, these subprime loans that you were buying from Long Beach that you knew had--already you had to buy back $1 billion worth of mortgages----"
"Mr. Sparks","No, Senator."
"Senator McCaskill","Because half of them were fraudulent? Are you talking about those assets?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I am talking--this is a broad topic about this industry and disclosure for securities when they were sold, and I do think it is relevant, if that is OK."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. I understand that there is--we are trying to hone in on why I have got so many unemployed people in my State and why so many people that I work for in Missouri have lost incredible amounts of money in their pensions. That is what we are honing in on today. So I want to look at these two transactions, and I want to talk a little bit about Timberwolf. OK. Timberwolf, in a document dated November 10, 2006--this is the memorandum, and you were cc'd on it, Mr. Sparks.\1\ This is basically where you go through and you talk about the asset selector, and that is where you learn that this firm that you picked on the asset selector on that, you had Greg, who was a partner at Goldman Sachs and was co-head of the Structured Products Group. In addition to Greg, you had Joe Marconi, a former managing director at Goldman Sachs in ABS Finance, joined Greywolf and is focused on structured product opportunities.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 98, which appears in the Appendix on page 603.  Of the 26 members of the research investment team that were investing--that were researching these assets to go into this synthetic derivative--by the way, this is the same one that your folks called ``shi**y'' later. This is the same one, OK? Seventeen members of the research staff are Goldman Sachs alumni. Now, they are not charging any management fees, Greywolf is not, and they are committing to 50 percent of the equity. You guys were sharing the warehousing risk, and, by the way, you were approving every asset going into the warehouse. Every single one. Now, that is in November 2006. Now, keep in mind, this instrument does not----"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator McCaskill."
"Senator McCaskill","Yes."
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know what page it is, but that is correct that former colleagues of ours had started a firm or joined the firm and that we shared warehouse risk on that transaction, if that is the question."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. That was in November. And then in December, we have an email from Deeb Salem--I do not know if I said his name right. No, it is from Michael Swenson.\1\ It is from Michael Swenson, and it is to Kevin Gasvoda and Justice Mahoney, and it says, ``After initially passing at 65-00 - ollie hit us at 65-00.'' Then Deeb Salem says, ``This is worth 10. It stinks. I don't want it in our book.'' This is all on Timberwolf.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 98, which appears in the Appendix on page 603.  Now, keep in mind, this is December before you had gone out and tried to sell this thing, OK?"
"Mr. Swenson","Senator, I am sorry, but I do not believe that email is regarding Timberwolf. Could you please point us to the exhibit here in the book?"
"Senator McCaskill","Sure. I am sorry, it may not be. GSAMP 06-FMIN N2, is that Timberwolf?"
"Mr. Swenson","Senator, without the document I cannot answer your question. I am sorry. I am trying to be helpful."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. It just takes so long. It is--what document is it? It is under Tab 98, and it is immediately following the memorandum about the makeup of Timberwolf. Maybe 0277 is the page right in front of it. Did you find it?"
"Mr. Swenson","No."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Well, I will come back to it."
"Mr. Swenson","The Deeb Salem email----"
"Senator McCaskill","We will have another time, and I will make sure you have a copy of it in front of you. OK? I have got plenty more. Let us go to March."
"Mr. Swenson","Senator, I think this email does not have anything to do with Timberwolf. I am sorry."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. All right. Well, we will show it to you, and if it was placed in the wrong place, then that is fine. But in March, the subject line says--it does say Timberwolf. ``Great job, Cactus Razzi trading us out of our entire Timberwolf single A position.'' That is March. Now, then we have some interesting representations in May. This is Exhibit 103,\2\ where there is a series of emails, basically where there is some worrying about misrepresentations. And these are emails from Daniel Sparks to Donald Mullen. ``There are some people working on Timberwolf is continuing to work  sales person feels there is a decent chance (but it will be a week out as they are traveling). Also, Cornac team working on it. If we get strong bids, can't we hit them?''  \2\ See Exhibit No. 103, which appears in the Appendix on page 671.  And then a response back from Don Mullen to Daniel Sparks: ``I doubt they will sell over weekend. And Harvey is concerned about the representations we may be making to clients as well as how we will price assets once we sell them to clients. I think we need to sort these things out before we make sales.'' And then the next one is from Harvey Schwartz to Daniel Sparks and Donald Mullen: ``Don't think we should slow or delay discussions. However, we need to huddle quickly before hitting bids, I think.'' This is all in May. Then the next email from Daniel Sparks says, ``Sounds fine.'' Then the next email is from Tom Montag to Daniel Sparks and others: ``Of course we should but this is how we find value by showing assets and seeing where bid comes. If  can value bad debt from  they can do this. They don't look to us for guidance. They pay what they think it's worth. Is there a different issue? We will value where the market shows us . . . if we find a bid, won't we?'' And then the last one from Donald Mullen to Sparks and Montag: ``Agreed we just need to make sure the proper communication occurs with clients. And we have thought through post sale pricing.'' So what is clear--and then you have the one later about how shi**y it was, OK? What is clear here is that there did not seem to be a great deal of confidence in the long side of this particular instrument. But the salespeople were being pushed to move it, and, it just looks like that you guys are not only making the market, you are playing in the market and mucking it up. Do you understand that?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I just read this particular email, and the issue that was being discussed in this particular email was when you make a sale on an illiquid asset, what is your bid price, you show that client, because oftentimes you marketed it and sometimes you had financed it. So there is a bid-offer spread with respect to securities and market makers, and my recollection of this particular point was what are we going to show them as our bid after that, and let us make sure we thought that through. And so on this particular email, that is what I recall."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Well, I guess what I would really like more clarity on--and I will come back to this in my next questioning--is, where in the organization does the decision made about someone who is coming to you--was somebody wanting to bet one side or the other on Timberwolf? It says in the memo that ``we have been approached.'' Were you approached by Greywolf or were you approached by a client?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Greywolf is a client, and Greywolf wanted to grow assets under management. So that is something money managers do."
"Senator McCaskill","So Greywolf was--they wanted to do this to grow their assets under management as a client of yours?"
"Mr. Sparks","Correct."
"Senator McCaskill","In that instance, you did not have a client wanting to bet one side or the other. You were helping them be part of the house. You were not helping them bet one side or the other."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I would need to review it, but I believe that they were willing to take an equity stake in their own deal. I would like to review that just to make sure."
"Senator McCaskill","They did. They took a 50-percent equity stake."
"Mr. Sparks","And so I would like to avoid the betting analogy, but part of their goal was to earn fees by managing assets, and we were trying to be helpful to them in that regard."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. And who is it that picked ACA? Who picked ACA?"
"Mr. Tourre","Again, it is a combination of Goldman Sachs and Paulson."
"Senator McCaskill","Now, typically, when somebody wants to make a bet, do you let them pick who picks what is in it?"
"Mr. Tourre","From an ACA perspective, they achieved two objectives in that transaction. One, similar to what Mr. Sparks said, they grew their assets under management and earned fees; and, two, they invested close to $1 billion of risk in the transaction as well for their insurance company. So they achieved their investment objectives."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. But you did not answer my question. Typically, do you let a client who wants to make a bet, wants you to do an instrument so they can make a bet--that is what Paulson wanted. He wanted you to make up a synthetic that he could bet on. Typically, when somebody comes to you and wants to bet, do you let them help pick the assets that go into the instrument, typically?"
"Mr. Tourre","In every synthetic CDO transaction, the protection buyer has to be involved in some shape or form in the creation of the portfolio; otherwise, there would be no transaction. If only the sort of protection seller could decide in its sole capacity as protection seller, the end assets, the protection seller would only select Treasury securities, and the transaction would have no risk. And no protection buyer could be in a situation to buy protection on such transactions. So even though in these transactions ultimately the portfolio selection agent ends up selecting all the securities, there are always suggestions from different parties as to, what the portfolio selection--how the portfolio gets constructed."
"Senator McCaskill","You understand that this does not make common sense, right? That somebody would want to go long on a fund that they were letting somebody who was going short pick the stuff in it. You understand that does not make common sense?"
"Mr. Tourre","Once again, the portfolio selection agent approved every single security in the deal. However, without a protection buyer, there is no deal. So Goldman Sachs and Paulson had to be also buying protection on this portfolio."
"Senator McCaskill","My time is up, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator McCaskill."
"Senator Pryor",""
"Senator Pryor","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I would like to start, if I could, with Mr. Sparks. Mr. Sparks, I would like to follow up on a question that Chairman Levin asked you in his first series of questioning, and what he said was, ``Do you have a responsibility to disclose to a client when you have an adverse interest to the client?'' Do you have a responsibility to disclose to a client when you have an adverse interest to the client? What is the answer to that?"
"Mr. Sparks","And, Senator, by adverse interest, do you mean a position that is different than them, or that there is something that we can effect that could harm them? Because if it is the former, our positioning, the answer is no. If we can do harm to them, the answer is absolutely."
"Senator Pryor","OK. So you do have, at least in some contexts, but not all, a responsibility to disclose to a client when you have an adverse interest to the client?"
"Mr. Sparks","I mean, Senator, I am just trying to be careful with my words with respect to what adverse interest could mean. If we were positioned a certain way, that is one thing. Again, we could have positions, there could be other positions at the firm."
"Senator Pryor","Do you have a responsibility to tell them what your positions are?"
"Mr. Sparks","No."
"Senator Pryor","Why not?"
"Mr. Sparks","Market makers are going to have positions all the time, and that is not something that is a responsibility of a market maker to tell your counterparties at all times how you are positioned."
"Senator Pryor","But why not? Shouldn't there be more transparency there?"
"Mr. Sparks","That is a prospective question or a current question?"
"Senator Pryor","Either way."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, currently that is not an obligation."
"Senator Pryor","Should it be?"
"Mr. Sparks","I know you are trying to figure this out----"
"Senator Pryor","You have been in this business for close to 20 years, correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Sure. I think it would create a number of issues because those positions change a lot, and, frankly, you do not always know what the positions are with respect to the person making that transaction. So I think functionally it would be very difficult. I also think that there are some things about it that could create other problems, such as if you--let us say you sold something to somebody and you were long, and you told them you were long. And then you went short. Do you need to call them back and tell them, ``I am now short''? Or do I need to call them before I go short? I just think there are a lot of issues that it could raise with respect to that."
"Senator Pryor","But at the moment when one of your clients, one of your customers, is making their decision, don't you think you owe them all the information that you have, including where your company is and how your company is positioned?"
"Mr. Sparks","I think we owe them all of the information with respect to that instrument that they are going to take a position on. That is not necessarily where we are, including because how we are positioned is not going to affect how that instrument performs."
"Senator Pryor","Well, it may not affect how it performs. It could, but it may not. But it does indicate, how you understand the deal, and if you think this is a good investment or not, or, if you are anticipating it doing one way or the other, shouldn't they know how you internally evaluate this?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, we could be----"
"Senator Pryor","Put your money where your mouth is. You put your money somewhere. Shouldn't they know that?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, we could be long a deal and not think it is a great deal, and we could be short a deal and like the deal but have it that position. So I do not think it is the obligation currently to disclose what your position is at that time."
"Senator Pryor","Well, let me ask about the rules of the road, because you just said you do not think it is a responsibility. Is there an established set of ethics in your industry of certain things you have to do or cannot do?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, I am not in the industry anymore. I do know, Senator, that----"
"Senator Pryor","But you were in the industry for, what, you said 18 years? I think that is what you said."
"Mr. Sparks","About 19 years."
"Senator Pryor","Nineteen years."
"Mr. Sparks","There are things such as--and the comment about investment adviser and fiduciaries. There are also rules with respect to research that I know that market makers in the investment banking industry are very careful to make sure that they follow. But market making itself, so long as people understand what they are investing in, I do not think that knowledge of the position of their counterparty is something that has to be disclosed, and I do not think it currently is disclosed by market makers."
"Senator Pryor","So you are saying that there is a time in which you put on the market maker cap and the rules change for you?"
"Mr. Sparks","We are market makers--in my business, we were market makers."
"Senator Pryor","OK. But let me ask this: When you are selling a security such as a CDO, my understanding is you are not a market maker. Isn't it true that you are a placement agent and as a placement agent you have a duty of full disclosure?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, that is correct. It might be helpful if I talk about in our department we really had two--we had a number of business activities, but we had two major business activities. One was an aggregation and distribution business where we aggregated assets, loans or securities or synthetics, and then distributed them in new issue type situations. In those situations, disclosure with respect to the assets and how the deals work--and that is very specific disclosure that has had years and years of input from regulators, counsel, other investors. That is that business."
"Senator Pryor","And those rules work well, those disclosure rules work well."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, those disclosure rules are meant to provide an investor with what they need to make their decision investing in that particular product."
"Senator Pryor","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","The second part of the business is a market- making business, which is a trading business. Now, there are risks in both of those businesses, but I thought it might be helpful for you to understand how we approach things."
"Senator Pryor","But the market-making business does not have the same disclosure rules as the other one does."
"Mr. Sparks","Because it is not creating new securities. There is disclosure on new securities, that is, if it is registered, it is dictated by the SEC. If it is not, then it is not. But usually they follow guidance for similar types of transactions. In secondary trading, it is just trading products that were already created."
"Senator Pryor","So let me go back to my question earlier about ethics. I mean, lawyers have to follow certain ethical standards. A doctor has to follow certain ethical standards. CPAs follow ethical standards, and, most professions have some sort of manual or some sort of code of ethics that they follow. Are you saying that is not the case in all aspects of your industry?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, Senator. I know where I worked, ethical standards were very important."
"Senator Pryor","Were those done by the company, or were they done by the industry, or were they done by the government?"
"Mr. Sparks","At Goldman, ethical standards were a focus. Numerous times there would be various off-site--when I say off- site, I mean you would take people out of what they were currently doing to go and discuss ethics and how important it is and how you deal with complex issues."
"Senator Pryor","Were those Goldman standards, or were they some sort of national standard or some industry standard? When you talk about ethics, what are you talking about?"
"Mr. Sparks","Those were Goldman standards, but I would tell you that industry--they factored in industry standards, and I would say, I guess, national standards. But I think Goldman Sachs had its own view of what those standards should be, and I found them to be typically very well thought out and, probably more robust than what a number of people in the industry would have had."
"Senator Pryor","And I think this goes back to Senator Collins' question where she asked you do you have a duty to act in the best interests of your clients, and based on what you have just said, it just depends on the circumstances."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I was trying to be careful with the concept of fiduciary, and we should work with clients to help them achieve their objectives. That does not mean that we are always going to have the same view on a particular investment, and they may want to sell something that we want to buy or vice versa. And I do not think there is a problem with that in the role of a market maker."
"Senator Pryor","OK. I am not sure everyone agrees with you on that, but I will take your answer. Let me ask now about a statement. I have just jotted something down here, and it says, ``Goldman sold a synthetic collateralized debt obligation''--CDO--``without disclosing that a hedge fund manager, John Paulson, helped design the CDO and was betting against the CDO.'' Is that true?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I think you are referring to the ACA transaction, the Abacus transaction that has been discussed. Any CDO--well, let me tell you how we, at Goldman Sachs, when CDOs were constructed, they were not constructed in a vacuum. Typically, we knew people who had investment criteria that they wanted to fill and wanted to invest in various parts of the capital structure with various underlying assets at various prices. At the same time, we had to get that risk, which means somebody had to sell the risk to create it. That could be done in cash form. It could be done in synthetic form. So I think it is helpful to note that these deals were not created in a vacuum. In that particular transaction, the function of providing the risks to it is from Goldman Sachs Capital Markets, I believe is the correct entity. I would like to check it, but I am pretty sure that is correct. That Goldman actually provided the risk, meaning went short into the Abacus ACA transaction. Goldman Sachs then, in its hedging of its positions, laid that risk off to a client that Goldman knew wanted to take that. So, I am trying to be specific on that question, Senator."
"Senator Pryor","Right, but so let me ask again: Goldman sold a synthetic collateralized debt obligation without disclosing that a hedge fund manager, John Paulson, helped design the CDO and was betting against the CDO. Did you disclose to your customers there that John Paulson was on the other side of this transaction and he had helped put it together?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I did not disclose--I was not specifically involved in that, but I would tell you that the disclosure documents would show what had been industry standards and what were material to that deal, which were the assets and how the deal worked. How the assets got in there, who was short it or long it, other than Goldman--because Goldman was technically shorted into that deal. In making the investment decision, what people should focus on and what is relevant to focus on were the assets and how the deal worked, not necessarily whose idea it was or various people who might have had input, because in the asset-backed business, the focus and what determines the outcome of those securities are the securities themselves and how the deal works."
"Senator Pryor","Do you believe that Goldman's actions contributed to the financial downturn we experienced in 2008?"
"Mr. Sparks","We had clients who lost money, and that is not good. That is not good for us. That is not good for our clients. We dealt with institutional investors. But when you look at the overall economy, there were a lot of individuals out there who were harmed because of the financial crisis, and although we did not deal directly with them, I know that I do, and I think my colleagues do or my former colleagues do, have sympathy for them. With respect to regrets, which I think may be what you are asking----"
"Senator Pryor","I did not ask about regret. I noticed, though, from the record that----"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, if I could finish."
"Senator Pryor","Go ahead."
"Mr. Sparks","Regret to me means something that you feel like you did wrong, and I do not have that. What I do have, though, is, we made mistakes in our business, like I think any business does, and we made some poor business decisions in hindsight."
"Senator Pryor","So do you think you contributed, your actions contributed to the financial downturn that we experienced in 2008?"
"Mr. Sparks","Do I think my personal actions did?"
"Senator Pryor","Goldman Sachs."
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know. I would like to think about that and respond. I have not thought about that specifically."
"Senator Pryor","Let me go ahead and ask the rest of the panel that. Mr. Birnbaum, do you believe that Goldman Sachs' actions contributed to the financial downturn that we experienced in 2008?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think it is important to distinguish our role in terms of the products that we were trading versus making broader judgments about Goldman Sachs. So I just want to be clear. Are you asking about our specific role with the products that we traded? Or are you asking us to sort of editorialize about the financial system and how investment banks played a role?"
"Senator Pryor","Well, I was actually asking about Goldman Sachs, but if you want to editorialize on the financial system, you can. But I was asking about Goldman."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Look, I think that, not working in a lot of areas of Goldman, there are things that may have happened that multiple investment banks and commercial banks may have provided too much credit, and that may have contributed to a bubble. And I would second what Mr. Sparks said. We are all sympathetic to the negative impact of that bubble. There was a lot of human pain and suffering that came from the bursting of the housing bubble. And to the extent that investment banks and commercial banks may have extended too much credit at certain periods of time--and, again, that is just--I do not have any personal witnessing of that--then it is possible."
"Senator Pryor","I guess what I am hoping to hear from the answers here is that you all take responsibility for your actions, and I have not heard that really so far in the first two, but I would like to ask the third. Mr. Swenson, did--or excuse me----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I do not think--which actions are you referring to that I took that I am not taking responsibility for? And Mr. Sparks as well."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, just to clarify, I do take responsibility for my actions, so if I left you with that impression, I want to be clear. I take responsibility for my actions."
"Senator Pryor","And do you think that your actions at Goldman and Goldman's actions generally contributed to the downturn that we experienced in 2008? Or you think Goldman was not part of the problem here. Is that what you are telling the Subcommittee?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, and I think that the purpose of this Subcommittee is to talk about what the problem is. I think it is clear that credit standards overall got loose."
"Senator Pryor","Got what?"
"Mr. Sparks","Loose, too loose."
"Senator Pryor","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","And that there were assumptions made, and I think risk overall was not respected across the industry, and we participated in that industry. So I do not know--I am not trying to avoid your question, Senator, but, I mentioned my feelings of what I did, and I do not have regrets about doing things that I think were improper. But we were a participant in an industry that got loose."
"Senator Pryor","Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Swenson","I think the reservation here is on the contributed part versus what caused, and we did not cause the financial crisis specifically to the mortgage desk, which is what I am here to speak about. You have two panels in subsequent meetings to speak about Goldman Sachs and our businesses. I do not think that we did anything wrong. There are things that we wish we could have done better in hindsight, but at the times that we made the decisions, I did not think we did anything wrong."
"Senator Pryor","Mr. Tourre."
"Mr. Tourre","Senator, I would echo some of my colleagues' comments. First, I take full responsibility for my actions. Second, I am saddened and humbled by what happened, in the market in 2007 and 2008, in the overall financial crisis. But I believe my conduct was proper. And, again, to the extent excess credit contributed to the asset price bubble which ultimately magnified the crisis, Goldman Sachs was involved in some of these products that potentially could have excessive credit extension, but, again, I firmly believe that my conduct was correct."
"Senator Pryor","I think that is one of the problems here,"
"Mr. Chairman","I think as part of your oversight here, I think the American people are hoping that you help us all figure out what went wrong and how we can fix it, but also I think that there is a lot of concern with the general public--and I know I am speaking for Arkansas here--that people around the country feel like Wall Street has contributed, in fact, has largely caused--I am not talking about one individual or one company, but Wall Street has contributed to and caused a lot of the economic crisis that we have been going through, and hopefully most of that is behind us now. But, my sense is that people feel like you are betting with other people's money and other people's future because, for example, in the real estate area, someone gets a mortgage and that gets sold and it gets chopped up and bounced around; and, instead of Wall Street, it looks more like Las Vegas. But they look at that, and all of a sudden they are losing control of their financial security. And I feel like, the fact that all of you have said basically throughout the course of this hearing really there is not a real clear ethical standard, there are not real bright lines on what you can and cannot do, and you wear different hats, and it is complicated; and, the fact, as Senator McCaskill said, you are market makers, but you are also playing in that market. And whether that is truly a conflict of interest or not, whether you truly have a fiduciary responsibility or not, I just think that we need to spend some time as the Senate and the Subcommittee and various committees in the Senate thinking through that. And, anyway, some of the things that we have heard today are very troubling, and I do sense that you are not taking full responsibility for your actions at Goldman's and also Goldman's actions and also the industry's actions that helped contribute to this financial meltdown. So, with that, Mr. Chairman, thank you."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator Pryor. Senator Ensign."
"Senator Ensign","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is an incredibly important hearing, and I appreciate you holding this. I want to make a couple of comments before I get into your questions. First of all, Senator Pryor, I think most people in Las Vegas would take offense at having Wall Street compared to Las Vegas, because in Las Vegas actually people know that the odds are against them. They play anyway. On Wall Street, they manipulate the odds while you are playing the game, and I would say that it is actually--it is much more dishonest because it is almost like somebody was playing a slot machine and the guys on Wall Street were in there kind of tweaking the odds while you were playing it, and in their favor the vast majority of the time."
"Senator Pryor","That is a fair point. And also in Las Vegas people are betting their own money, and that is not always the case with----"
"Senator Ensign","That is very good. A couple other comments. First of all, I think that Wall Street definitely had a role in the financial crisis, but I also think we have a responsibility here on our end between the Community Reinvestment Act, Fannie and Freddie, out of control that we let them get, that is certainly--because without the real estate market doing what it was doing, I mean, that is where these bets were occurring, and everybody got the false idea that the whole real estate value was going to continue to go up and up and up, where bubbles never continue to go up. We know that. And, unfortunately, a lot of smart people on Wall Street got fooled by that. The point that I want to make also is that you all have mentioned that you are market makers, and I think part of this hearing is to find out whether you were actually market manipulators instead of just market makers. And I think that is a key part of it, and that is where I am going to take some of my questioning. I want to start with talking about the role of the credit rating agencies. Did you personally or do you know of Goldman Sachs employees who actually spoke to the credit rating agencies and tried to influence how some of these tranches were rated? Go down the line, just yes or no."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I personally did not typically speak with them, but people on my team worked with the agencies on new issues with respect to helping them understand it and how the deals would be rated."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Next."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I did not know anyone who would fit under that category."
"Mr. Swenson","I have the same answer as Mr. Birnbaum."
"Senator Ensign","OK."
"Mr. Tourre","I did work with rating agencies, Senator, similarly to explain to those rating agencies the products that needed to be rated."
"Senator Ensign","OK. This would be for Mr. Sparks and Mr. Tourre. How do you justify taking BBB-rated products, repackaging them, and getting the rating agencies to re-rate those as AAA-rated products? Because that is what they did."
"Mr. Tourre","Should I try to address that question, Senator?"
"Senator Ensign","Sure."
"Mr. Tourre","Ultimately, rating agencies have their own models to rate products. We were not influencing in any shape or form, the way they rated these transactions, at least their models. We were just applying their modeling assumptions."
"Senator Ensign","In their modeling assumptions, which nobody supposedly knows about, though, you both said that you either did yourself or you know people who did, went to the rating agencies and tried to convince them about the products. How can you justify taking BBB-rated products, repackaging those as AAA products--trying to sell those as AAA products? I mean, because that is what a lot of the CDOs did, correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes."
"Senator Ensign","That is correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, the rationale that the agencies gave, I believe, was because of an assumption of diversity, which meant that certain deals would perform differently than other deals. And so in that collection, the assessment from the agencies and I think the market assessment at the time was that deal performance had less correlation amongst themselves."
"Senator Ensign","Mr. Tourre, you were about to answer."
"Mr. Tourre","I would just add one more point, which is that rating agencies rely on, historical data to rate those transactions, and when rating the products I think you are referring to as CDO products, repackaging BBB securities, they relied on the historical performance of BBB-rated obligations to rate the CDO products."
"Senator Ensign","Do you think that their ratings made sense?"
"Mr. Tourre","I mean, the methodology made sense."
"Senator Ensign","You believe their methodology made sense?"
"Mr. Tourre","The mathematical methodology made sense. The assumption that, historical performance is a good indicator of future performance for certain asset classes proved to be not correct."
"Senator Ensign","Did you ever feel an obligation to people who were buying those products from you to let them know that these were BBB-rated products that were repackaged as AAA?"
"Mr. Tourre","I mean, the specifics of the products were always disclosed in the offering documents."
"Senator Ensign","That is not what my question was. Did you feel an obligation at all--this gets back to not necessarily a fiduciary obligation, but did you feel these people are buying this stuff from us, and do you understand that these are triple--I mean, did you tell them specifically that these were actually BBB-rated products that were repackaged and the credit rating agencies somehow in their wisdom repackaged them or rescored them as AAA-rated products?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, you are exactly right on point, and that relates to a point I am not sure if you were here for, which is what the underlying assets are is what is material. So that information would be disclosed at new issue as to what underlies the security."
"Senator Ensign","Goldman Sachs, though, is looked at, I think, by a lot of people--one of the reasons that people want to do business with Goldman Sachs and some of the other major players in Wall Street is that they feel that you have a certain level of expertise. And I think that is kind of what we are trying to get at up here, is whether or not you believe the modeling was correct, good modeling as far as rating agencies were concerned, Mr. Sparks?"
"Mr. Sparks","I do not have the specifics of their modeling. I think in hindsight the historical correlation was much higher than what the rating agencies assumed."
"Senator Ensign","I think for anybody to defend what the rating agencies did would be ludicrous at this point, and I think that there is plenty of evidence out there to show what they did. Do you all pay the rating agencies?"
"Mr. Sparks","Typically, that would be paid by people involved in the deal. So it could be a deal expense. It could be an issuer."
"Senator Ensign","Right. So Goldman Sachs does pay large amounts of money to the rating agencies. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","On those deals, oftentimes it did."
"Senator Ensign","And do you think that that maybe appeared-- has at least an appearance of a potential conflict of interest?"
"Mr. Sparks","With respect to maybe appearance of a conflict of--yes, I think that there is that concern with respect to that particular point."
"Senator Ensign","I want to go to a deal that Goldman Sachs did, known as Hudson 1. It was a synthetic CDO that referenced $2 billion in subprime BBB-rated mortgage-backed securities. Goldman selected the referenced assets. The purpose of the transaction appears to have been to get those assets off Goldman's own books. Basically Goldman was the only buyer to sell this CDO and then make a bet against it. Is that an accurate description of what happened with Hudson 1?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I believe that deal was purely static synthetic, which means----"
"Senator Ensign","Describe static synthetic, because one of the things that I think confuses a lot of people is the definitions that you all put on things. For instance, you called something that was actually the first floor, the bottom floor, you described it as a mezzanine so it did not sound so bad. There is a lot of spin that happened in your terminology in dealing with all these financial products to make them sound a little better than others. So could you please explain as we are going just for other people listening?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Senator. The term ``static'' meant that the assets that were set in the deal could not change. The reason that is important is there were other CDOs that were done where an asset manager or someone else could choose to change the assets in the pool under certain parameters. So in this particular case, static meant here are the reference notes, the reference obligations that you are exposed to, and this is what they are going to be. Synthetic meant that there were no actual cash securities that had been put in there, so, Goldman did not sell those securities into that because there were not securities with respect to the reference on that."
"Senator Ensign","Yes, but it operated the same way as cash being in there, didn't it?"
"Mr. Sparks","Correct. It had the risk of that, and that deal, my recollection is it had a combination of single-name CDS and some of the risk related to the ABX Index outright."
"Senator Ensign","And Goldman obviously recognized that there was some significant risk with that particular product, and that is why they sold them short, correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, this deal I think was done in October 2006, if I----"
"Senator Ensign","I do not have the date in front of me."
"Mr. Sparks","There were investors, a lot of investors, in 2006 and there continued to be investors in 2007 who wanted exposure and risk in certain forms. And so, I had mentioned that these deals did not operate in a vocuum----"
"Senator Ensign","Is that a little unusual, though, for Goldman Sachs to be the only part of it that did the entire deal on the short?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, most of the time--not all the time--on synthetics, Goldman would provide the synthetic short into the deal for a number of reasons, some of which included the fact that we were involved in the deal. But then what we did with our risk on the other side could vary."
"Senator Ensign","I think that one of the points that needs to be made, first of all, is--and I think it is evidenced by the hearings that this Subcommittee has been having--is that this is an incredibly complex area of not only our markets but of our law. And, Mr. Chairman, I think that the hearings that you are holding are very valuable. But I think that we are just scratching the surface, and I think it is one of the reasons that I believe very strongly we need to fix the markets, we need to have a lot more transparency, and we need to make sure that people are not being market manipulators, that, some of the lines of questioning today that have come out, actually probably some good suggestions in there, but a lot more needs to be done and a lot more research needs to be done. And I hope that the Senate actually takes its time, so one is that we do not end up hurting the little guys out there in Main Street and we actually go after the people that--whether it was AIG, Goldman Sachs, any of the other big traders, whether it was Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I hope that is what the financial regulatory reform focuses on. I do want to get--and just I hate to keep harping on this, but I think this is going to be an important part of what comes out, and that is, do you believe that--and since the two of you are the only ones who responded to this earlier, getting back to the rating agencies, do you believe that Goldman Sachs improperly influenced the rating agencies?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, Senator."
"Senator Ensign","Mr. Tourre."
"Mr. Tourre","No, Senator."
"Senator Ensign","I appreciate having that on the record. The other point that I think that needs--kind of an interesting point, when everything was going up, markets were going up, everybody was batting happy, people at your firms and people at other firms on Wall Street made a heck of a lot of money in bonuses. Would you agree with that? I mean, large amounts of money. A pretty factual statement, wouldn't you agree?"
"Mr. Sparks","Are you asking me?"
"Senator Ensign","Yes. Interesting when everything kind of came to a crash, incredible bonuses were still paid out, even in firms where their actual investors lost huge amounts of money, lost everything. Do you think that the incentives that are set up in firms like Goldman Sachs are the proper incentives to have folks engage in ethical behavior?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Senator, I think Goldman Sachs works hard to engage in ethical behavior in all aspects----"
"Senator Ensign","I did not say that. I said: Do you think the way that the pay structure and the bonuses are set up lead to the proper incentives to have the people at Goldman Sachs and other folks who do what you do on Wall Street, do you think that those incentives are there that lead to ethical behavior?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, Mr. Birnbaum and I do not work there anymore, so I do not know exactly what their----"
"Senator Ensign","That is why I am asking you just a general comment about the way that bonuses are paid on Wall Street. Obviously, when the bonuses are paid when everybody is making money, that kind of makes sense to me. But when everybody is-- all your people who are buying things from you who bought in the past, all of a sudden they lose huge amounts of money, and folks still get paid huge bonuses, that does not make sense. That does not make sense to a lot of Americans. That is what I am asking. Do you think the incentives are the proper incentives to have ethical behavior on Wall Street?"
"Mr. Sparks","Again, Senator, I do not know----"
"Senator Ensign","It is just your opinion."
"Mr. Sparks","I do not know currently what those are, so I do not want to----"
"Senator Ensign","The way that you were paid in the past, how about that?"
"Mr. Sparks","I believe consistent--yes, in the past, I believe at Goldman Sachs that----"
"Senator Ensign","You had proper incentives, bonus structures were proper?"
"Mr. Sparks","I believe at Goldman Sachs in the past I had every reason to be ethical with respect to what the firm did with me, including compensation."
"Senator Ensign","Mr. Birnbaum."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I mean, just to give some background on how people at Goldman--and I cannot speak for the way it works today because I am not there anymore. But the way people are paid there and the way people are promoted there, it is a function of performance, and a lot of that performance is indeed financial. But a huge component of performance at a place like Goldman is of a qualitative nature. It has to do with the culture of the firm, and it has to do with ethics, and it has to do with how one works within a team. And I can assure you that you can have enormous financial performance, but if you were not cognizant of ethics, you would not be promoted, you would not be paid; in fact, you would probably be fired."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Swenson","I echo the comments that Mr. Birnbaum said. The simple answer to your question is yes."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Mr. Tourre."
"Mr. Tourre","I would echo some of my colleagues' comments that the compensation structure which is based on the firm's performance, the business' performance, and, the personal performance, at least at Goldman Sachs, I think were aligning incentives correctly."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator Ensign. I think as all the questions have gone today, I think that we are seeing some of the problems. Thank you, Senator Ensign. Senator Tester."
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your holding this hearing. It has been a pretty long morning. I do not know if there is going to be anybody coming after me or not, but I want to thank you folks for being here today. I appreciate it very much. I think we will head in a couple different directions here. Mr. Birnbaum, why, how, and when did you become convinced that there was a housing bubble on the verge of collapse?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do not believe I used those words."
"Senator Tester","OK. You guys have got a bevy of attorneys that have briefed you on everything. If you do not want to answer my questions, you do not have to."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I want to answer your questions precisely."
"Senator Tester","I will rephrase it. Why, how, and when did you become convinced that there was a housing bubble that was in decline?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","My sentiment that I expressed in my opening statement was that there was a market in residential mortgage- backed securities in subprime that I thought was overvalued."
"Senator Tester","OK. So it was based on the housing bubble, and its decline or collapse, however you want to put--however I want to put it."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I did not say that, though. That is how you put it."
"Senator Tester","OK. So did you not think the housing market was in decline?"
"Senator Tester","Do you think the housing is in decline right now?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","At that point in time, housing was in decline already."
"Senator Tester","What point in time? I did not bring up a date."
"Mr. Birnbaum","You were referencing my opening statement, I think."
"Senator Tester","I was just asking you a question. When do you think the housing market started in its decline? When did you come about that?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","When did housing start to decline or when----"
"Senator Tester","When did you become aware of it?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","When did I become aware that housing values were declining?"
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I believe housing started to decline in the beginning or to the middle of 2006. It depends on how you track these things."
"Senator Tester","OK. Middle or end of 2006. And you base that--and I do not want to put words in your mouth--on the subprime market?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, no. You asked me about housing."
"Senator Tester","OK. The housing market, what did you base that decline upon?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, typically when people are talking about the housing market declining or going up, they are talking about housing prices. So we all have publicly available information on housing prices that is released, typically monthly, sometimes quarterly, and if that is what you are referring to----"
"Senator Tester","So the housing decline was based on housing prices around the middle to end of 2006. It was not based on subprime or--it was based on that pattern. I am not trying to set you up for anything."
"Mr. Birnbaum","No, I just want to understand the question."
"Senator Tester","I want to know when--look, a lot of these vehicles that were developed were based on housing. You guys are smart guys, and particularly I want to know from you, Mr. Birnbaum, when you saw the downturn, the potential collapse. You said the middle, end of 2006. I was wondering what you base that on, and you said the value of housing at that point in time. Or what did you say?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, we had all seen a deceleration--first, a deceleration and then a decline in housing values. That was one of many things that I think concerned people."
"Senator Tester","Did this change your view of mortgage- backed securities?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, the mortgage market is a big market. You have agency mortgages, you have non-agency mortgages, you have prime mortgages, subprime mortgages."
"Senator Tester","Sure."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I believe what I referred to in my opening statement was the subprime market."
"Senator Tester","OK. So based on subprime, did it change your view of the mortgage-backed securities?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","It changed my view of the likely direction of the market."
"Senator Tester","OK. Did you share your thoughts with others at Goldman, or did you keep them to yourself?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I did socialize my thoughts with some people. As I mentioned in my opening statement, there was a vigorous debate about Goldman about that issue."
"Senator Tester","OK. Given that knowledge, were you surprised by Mr. Tourre's statement that the Abacus deal was similar to others in terms of quality?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I was not surprised by that statement."
"Senator Tester","You were not surprised by it?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","No."
"Senator Tester","OK. Should we be reassured that the Abacus deal was no worse than any of the others, then?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I did not work on the Abacus deals. I could not be surprised because I did not work on those deals."
"Senator Tester","OK. All right. That is fine. They always say you always want to know the answer to a question before you ask it, and I do not know the answer to this question because it is--I am going to start with you, Mr. Sparks. Do you think that Goldman Sachs did anything wrong in this whole process of these synthetic CDOs?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I do not think Goldman did something wrong, meaning----"
"Senator Tester","So you do not think Goldman did anything wrong?"
"Mr. Sparks","But that does not mean that we did not do deals that were bad decisions to do and did not perform like we wanted them to do, and it does not mean that we did not periodically make mistakes like any other business does. But ``wrong'' to me has some qualitative comment about doing something inappropriate. That does not mean we did not make mistakes or do deals that did not turn out the way we had hoped they would."
"Senator Tester","OK. What is your definition of a synthetic CDO so we know if we are on the same page?"
"Mr. Sparks","Sure. It would be a collection of--well, there could be a number. Basically it is a CDO where there is no cash instruments involved, so the reference portfolio, although it is listed as a bunch of assets, it is clear it is actually not that. It is done by shorting in some sort of derivative into that, and from that you can either create cash instruments for people to invest in or synthetic instruments."
"Senator Tester","Do you know when this idea was thought up, the synthetic CDO idea? Is this a fairly new phenomenon or has it been around for decades?"
"Mr. Sparks","I believe it would have been--and I cannot give you an exact date, but I believe it would have been in the early 2000s. It happened to a larger degree in the corporate market."
"Senator Tester","And this was just to give folks that had money something to gamble on? You can say what you want, but it is gambling. I am not going to go down to bookie and all that line, but you are basically gambling on something that has--you are not going to get any money out of it to do the synthetic CDO."
"Mr. Sparks","No. Sometimes you can do a synthetic CDO and actually create cash bonds by putting in some collateral, but I think your question is why."
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Sparks","There are and were investors who wanted to invest in these types of structures at those market levels. They actually desired to get more exposure or exposure tailored to something that they wanted."
"Senator Tester","And in letting the people know about how they are designed and what is in them, does anybody have obligation to let those investors know what is in that financial instrument?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, and at new issue, disclosure is provided that shows both what the underliers are, how the deal would work with respect to any potential changes to the underliers, and then how the cash flows actually will work, because typically those transactions would be tranched with respect to risk layers, but not always."
"Senator Tester","OK. So the Chairman in his questioning asked--I think it was you, Mr. Sparks--how you got comfortable with sales. And I am just going to bring three of them up--four of them, actually. I am going to bring four of them that came out of documents the Subcommittee did. There was a Hudson 2006-1 synthetic CDO sold December 2006; 18 months later it was--these were AAAs--downgraded to junk. There was an Anderson 2000-1, set up the first quarter of 2007; 7 months later it was downgraded to junk. There was the Timberwolf that has been talked about here before, March 2007, AAA downgraded to junk in less than year. That was the bad deal one. There was the Abacus, closed end of April 2007; within 6 months it was rated down by 84 percent. Now, going back to the answer that Mr. Birnbaum gave that we could see some things happening in the middle of 2006, middle of 2007, all of these--all but one of these came after that effect. How can you in good faith set these aside and sell them out and collect the fees and make the dough?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, is that to me, sir?"
"Senator Tester","Yes, sure."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I just want to clarify. The things that I was referring to are things that every market participant observed."
"Senator Tester","That is OK. That is all right. I am not assuming that you were brilliant in that assertion. I think it is spot on. I appreciate that answer. I am just asking Mr. Sparks, after the fact we saw things happening, and every one of these were--it looks like a wreck waiting to happen because they were all downgraded to junk in very short order."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Senator, at the time we did those deals, we expected those deals to perform."
"Senator Tester","Perform in what way?"
"Mr. Sparks","To not be downgraded----"
"Senator Tester","Perform to go to junk, so that the shorts made out?"
"Mr. Sparks","To not be downgraded to junk in that short a time frame. In fact, to not be downgraded to junk. And so, if I could finish."
"Senator Tester","OK. Keep going."
"Mr. Sparks","I mentioned that we made some bad business decisions. These deals performed horribly. That is bad."
"Senator Tester","And there is a pattern of it, yes."
"Mr. Sparks","OK. That said, at the time, just because one person in my business unit or a few people might have had one view, I can tell you there were a lot of other people in my business unit that had a very different view, and there were a lot of other investors that had a very different view."
"Senator Tester","Do you feel confident that the information about each one of these that was about these was given to the investors, all the information that was out there, and the credit rating agencies, too?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I generally feel that the disclosure for the new issues that Goldman Sachs brought was good."
"Senator Tester","How about these?"
"Mr. Sparks","Including these."
"Senator Tester","OK. I think there was a credit rating agency that testified--correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Chairman. I know you are busy so you might not be able to--but that said that in the Abacus deal they did not know anything about Paulson; it would have changed the thing markedly if they would have. Whose obligation is it to tell the credit rating agency?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I do have a view on that comment, and I think I said earlier that I found the rating agencies to work very hard in what they did and trying to get the right answer. On that particular comment, the rating agencies rate the deal. That means what the assets are in the deal and--whatever the assets are, they are. And so I found--I was surprised by that comment because the deal is the deal, and the agency understood that, and so that was a surprising comment to me."
"Senator Tester","It does not--and this has happened before, but it really does not click--going back to Senator McCaskill's question, it does not click that there was something fundamentally wrong with Paulson being able to pick these?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Goldman Sachs--Senator, I just want to make sure you understand mechanically how that type of deal worked."
"Senator Tester","Are you saying Paulson did not have any role in this at all?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, sir, I am not."
"Senator Tester","OK. Then----"
"Mr. Sparks","Goldman Sachs----"
"Senator Tester","Then let us just leave it at that level."
"Mr. Sparks","OK."
"Senator Tester","Paulson had a role in picking these securities, and you do not see anything wrong with that? In fact, if the credit agency is saying that it would have fundamentally changed the way they rated it, you cannot associate yourself with those comments because you do not think they are right?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, Goldman Sachs provided the short risk to that transaction, a very specific set of names. Whatever Goldman did with those names, how that affects what a rating agency rates that, that to me does not make any sense."
"Senator Tester","OK. We have got--I do not know what you call it--a fault line or whatever it might be. That may be the wrong term. I want to go back to a previous question that was asked that dealt with--and you kind of all skirted it except for Mr. Birnbaum. But it has been brought up several times here, by the Ranking Member also. That is, who do you consider yourself working for? Who is in the best interest here, the client or the firm? Now, I do not want to go back and forth and go through the same questions that were answered before. But the question is that you have to work for one or the other when push comes to shove. You cannot be for both because there are certain times where you just cannot be for both. Am I wrong in that assumption? Go ahead, Mr. Sparks."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, that is a very complicated question, but if you do not prudently manage your risk, you will not be around to work for your clients."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","So I think you are looking for a broad response to that, and I would say clients are extremely important to Goldman Sachs and to market makers that I think are going to have a chance to succeed. But that does not mean that you should be imprudent with respect to risk."
"Senator Tester","OK. I think everybody--I should not speak for everybody on the Subcommittee, but I will try and they can correct me later if they want. But I think everybody understands that there needs to be some level of regulation here, mainly because from my perspective, because of the TARP bailout, it is probably why Goldman is still here, because of the taxpayers and because the Congress did what they did. But I guess the question here is that, as we move forward-- and I list Anderson and Timberwolf and Abacus, and all these where I think they were clients of yours that bought this stuff. It went south in a regular pattern. It just was not one, it was not a changed interest. And you guys made some dough on it, on the short selling of it. You did. And Paulson made out like a bandit on this thing."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, on each of those deals, I----"
"Senator Tester","So the firm did pretty well."
"Mr. Sparks","I do not think the firm did well on every one of those deals. In fact, it is possible and more likely that on those particular deals the firm lost a fair amount of money. I would have to go back and do the math on each one, but on those deals that you picked out that performed very poorly--and they did--Goldman Sachs I think lost a fair amount of money because Goldman retained a fair amount of risk on those deals."
"Senator Tester","Yes, I mean, even including the short selling you did on it?"
"Mr. Sparks","That is why I would need to go back and net it off."
"Senator Tester","Yes, I think the Chairman asked you for that information, so we will be looking forward to that. OK. If you were in my shoes and we are on the verge of doing some Wall Street reform, potentially--I hope we get pass the verge and get into the debate of it--what would you change? Anything?"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I think clearly some things need to be changed. I have not read what is proposed, so I am not in a great position to----"
"Senator Tester","You really do not need to read what is proposed. Actually, you are in the business. OK? I am a farmer, and if you asked me what we need to change in agriculture, I could tell you pretty quick. I am assuming that you are a smart guy in the financial services--I know you are, and I do not mean that as a derogatory comment. As you look at the regulations that fell in--and some people made a lot of money, some people lost a lot of money. I do not know if it was because people did not get told the whole story or not. If they did not, then I think there is a problem there. But is there anything in the regulatory that you looked at--you work and you are high up in management--what would you change?"
"Mr. Sparks","Well, again, I do not work at Goldman Sachs anymore, so I do not want to speak for Goldman----"
"Senator Tester","I know, but going back, I do not think things have changed with the regulatory structure at all since you worked there."
"Mr. Sparks","I feel like we worked really hard to manage our risk prudently. I think it is a very hard question, and I think that when you look at what gradually became too much credit available in the system and there were many people who participated in that system and actually, so long as that was going, it was good for those people. The kind of regulator, not meaning technical regulator, but there was not a defuse valve to monitor that."
"Senator Tester","OK. And, actually, the testimony says it. Even when the markets were going down--Senator Ensign talked about it. Let me see if I can find the exact statement here. You guys did pretty well--2009 Goldman Sachs' annual report states that the firm did not generate enormous net revenues by betting against residential-related products. Documents obtained by the Subcommittee, however, indicate two top Goldman mortgage traders, Michael Swenson and Joshua Birnbaum, discussed their 2007 performance evaluation as a very profitable year and extraordinary profits. So you guys made money going both directions."
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I would just like to clarify a couple of the numbers----"
"Senator Tester","And there is a lot of folks that did not make money going both directions. There is a lot of guys that lost their retirement, they lost everything they had when it dropped off."
"Senator Ensign","Senator Tester, one of the clarifying points is even if Goldman Sachs did not make it, the executives did."
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Senator Ensign","They made huge bonuses."
"Senator Tester","I am with you. We are together. Go ahead,"
"Mr. Sparks",""
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, there are two things I thought just to clarify. One, on the graph that was shown--I ran the Mortgage Department, and I was responsible for risk in my department. I do not think that was reflective of the risk that I managed. And two, I have heard a lot of numbers about what Goldman Sachs made. My department, which included these guys and other businesses, including commercial mortgages where we made money, the number was $1.1 to $1.2 billion in 2007. That is the revenue number. So that is the number I know. That was roughly 20 to 25 percent more than the year before. And the reason I give you that, I felt--and I said I was proud. I thought the firm managed it well."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","But that was not that typical a year in that business. So I just wanted to make sure that the numbers that I know--that I pointed that out, because I had heard some numbers that I felt like were not accurate."
"Senator Tester","OK. Well, first of all, I do want to thank you all for being there, and I mean that. I also would like to have you guys just go out and have a pop, and we will leave the attorneys out of this thing, because I know you have got to cover yourselves on a lot of this stuff. The fact is I think we have got a problem, and I think we have got a problem with what has gone on on Wall Street, and I do not want to see it reoccur again. And the truth is I need good information if I am going to make good decisions. A lot of that good information could come from you guys. I think you have had to temper it. I understand that. That is OK. I think it has been pretty obvious. But that is OK. That is what you were instructed to do, and you did a good job. But the fact is that the bottom line is we cannot let this happen again, or if it does happen, the chances have to be very slim of it. And when you have got folks out there that are betting basically on the weather or whatever it might be, I just think it can put the whole thing into a turmoil unless it is pretty tightly controlled. That is my own opinion. But I do not--we have got to figure out how to do that so it is done right and transparency is the bottom line. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I overspoke my time. Thank you very much."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator Tester. Turn to Exhibit 170c,\1\ if you would, Mr. Sparks. A number of my colleagues have raised the Hudson deal. This is the deal where you were selling your own stuff from your own inventory to people, and bet against it heavily. We are going to go into that deal now. You were selling this to others.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 170c, which appears in the Appendix on page   First of all, what are you selling to others? Here is what you are selling to others, according to your own employee, Exhibit 170c. You are selling junk. OK? That is what that employee says. The question from a man named Tetsuya Ishikawa to Sarah Lawlor. ``Understand AIB''--which is Allied Irish Bank--``do . . . deals but what specifically did AIB say was `junk' about the Hudson Mezz deal?'' What did one of your potential clients say was junk about the stuff you were trying to sell? And what is the answer to that? ``You may want to ask Sarah about this when she's there tomorrow and Friday. . . . She said''--this is now your employee--``AIB are too smart to buy this kind of junk''--that is the junk you are selling, Mr. Sparks. Now, let us see what is it you are selling. Take a look at Exhibit 86.\1\ This is an exhibit entitled--same thing--Hudson Mezzanine, sent by Peter Ostrem, who is the head of Goldman's Asset-Based Securities CDO Desk, to the Goldman team, announcing a new CDO. What is this new CDO? It is Hudson. ``We have been asked to do a CDO of $2 billion for the desk.'' That is the Goldman trading desk, and that is ``obviously important to '' folks. They say that in Exhibit 86. We have been asked to put together a CDO that contains our stuff from our inventory. Your inventory is too long. This is now towards the end of 2006.  \2\ See Exhibit No. 86, which appears in the Appendix on page 550.  Now take a look at Exhibit 90.\3\ Who do you think is betting against the stuff that you are referencing in this synthetic CDO? You are referencing your own stuff, and it is junk. That is your own employee's assessment. And you are trying to get out of this, and so you create a synthetic CDO so you can transfer that risk to your customers. OK? And who do you think is going to benefit when you transfer that risk on the short side? The so-called protection buyer. Take a look at Exhibit 90. ``Goldman was the sole buyer of protection on the entire $2.0 billion of assets.''  \3\ See Exhibit No. 90, which appears in the Appendix on page 588.  If you can sell your junk and shift the risk on that in a synthetic CDO, Goldman puts $2 billion in its pocket. Now, you have got a marketing booklet. That is Exhibit   \1\ See Exhibit No. 87, which appears in the Appendix on page 551. "
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, I missed the one before Exhibit 87. I apologize. Could you tell me----"
"Senator Levin","No, I am not going to waste any more time."
"Mr. Sparks","OK. I am just trying to flip through to make sure I understand exactly--there were a number of Hudson deals, and I am just making sure----"
"Senator Levin","OK. All right."
"Mr. Sparks","I remember which deal it was."
"Senator Levin","Maybe we can get an answer this time. Hudson Mezzanine. Are we ready? Which one didn't you understand? Did you understand the one about junk?"
"Mr. Sparks","I read the one where AIB called it junk and decided not to invest."
"Senator Levin","And your own person said they are too smart to buy this kind of junk."
"Mr. Sparks","I thought they said that it was junk and they were too smart to buy it. I will look at it again. I am just trying to go fast."
"Senator Levin","OK, take your time, Exhibit 170c. A Goldman Sachs person, Ishikawa, wrote: ``You may want to ask Sarah about this when she's there tomorrow and Friday. . . . She said `AIB are too smart to buy this kind of junk . . .' ''"
"Mr. Sparks","I see that now, Senator."
"Senator Levin","OK. Now let us talk about what you are selling."
"Mr. Sparks","So then I go to Exhibit 86----"
"Senator Levin","You are on the short side of this, right? You are going to make money if this synthetic CDO is sold. Is that correct? You are getting rid of----"
"Mr. Sparks","Senator, at this particular time, because I believe this email was September 2006. I believe at the time the firm was positioned very long with respect to the market at that time."
"Senator Levin","It was, and you are trying to be less long."
"Mr. Sparks","You had said the firm got short. I do not believe it got short."
"Senator Levin","You are creating a synthetic CDO, and there is a bet going on against stuff that is in your inventory; you are betting against that stuff, and someone else is betting for it."
"Mr. Sparks","We were long risk, and we were reducing risk."
"Senator Levin","That is exactly what I said. You are trying to shift the risk of that junk to somebody else. This is what is going on. It is a synthetic CDO, OK? The whole point of the synthetic CDO, if you will take a look at that exhibit that I just referred you to, Goldman is the sole buyer of protection. You got that?"
"Mr. Sparks","That is the one I was looking for, but I----"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 90.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 90, which appears in the Appendix on page 588. "
"Mr. Sparks","Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Do you see it there, the middle of the page? October 30, 2006. ``Goldman was the sole buyer of protection on the entire $2 billion of assets.'' You are trying to shift the risk, exactly as you said. You are trying to shift the risk, and you did it. So you are benefiting now from selling stuff from your inventory. You want to go less long, and you are betting against that. OK? We are together?"
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, any time we sell something to somebody, we have transferred the risk. I agree with that."
"Senator Levin","Right. That is all I am saying. In this case, it is junk from your inventory, and you are trying to go less long."
"Mr. Sparks","Well, I can tell you at the time, Mr. Chairman, I did not believe it was junk, and we did not believe it was junk. A salesperson said that. I think that is a salesperson who had an opinion, and as I mentioned, a lot of people had different opinions."
"Senator Levin","Right. That is true. Your salesperson believed it was junk. That is who was selling your stuff. Now, take a look at Exhibit 87.\2\ This is your sales pitch. ``Goldman Sachs has aligned incentives with the Hudson program by investing in a portion of equity and playing the ongoing role of Liquidation Agent.'' So now you are telling people that you are on the long side. That is your Executive Summary. You tell them in some fine print somewhere that you are shifting the risk, but this is what the Executive Summary says. It states you have ``incentives aligned with the program.''  \2\ See Exhibit No. 87, which appears in the Appendix on page 551.  No, you do not. Your incentives are aligned against this thing. Your incentives are to sell $2 billion and shift the risk. And so you are telling people, that you are selling this to--that Goldman Sachs has aligned incentives with the Hudson program by investing in a portion of equity. That means you are on the long side. You are investing a little bit on the long side. Two billion bucks of risk you are shifting, and you are telling people in the Executive Summary that the incentives are aligned. They are not aligned. They are the opposite. You are shifting risk. You are not taking on risk. This is one of your structured products that you are selling, these synthetic CDOs that nobody can figure out. Take a look at Exhibit 91,\3\ Mr. Sparks. This is another synthetic CDO that you guys are peddling, shifting risk, making money when you go short. You tell Mr. Montag, ``Need you to send message to Peter Ostrem and Darryl Herrick telling them what a great job they did. They structured like mad''--``they structured like mad''--``and traveled the world, and worked their tails off to make some lemonade from some big old lemons.'' Making lemonade from some big old lemons!  \3\ See Exhibit No. 91, which appears in the Appendix on page 589.  You say that--by the way, going back to Hudson----"
"Mr. Sparks","Is that in Exhibit 91, lemonade?"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 91. Look right in the middle. ``Need you to send message''--you see those words? ``Need you to send message to Peter Ostrem and Darryl Herrick''--who is Peter Ostrem?"
"Mr. Sparks","Peter Ostrem at the time was a managing director that ran our cash CDO business."
"Senator Levin","All right. And who is Darryl Herrick?"
"Mr. Sparks","Darryl was part of Peter's group."
"Senator Levin","``. . . and tell them what a great job they did. They structured like mad.'' What did they do? They made some lemonade from some big old Goldman Sachs lemons. You have got no regrets? You ought to have plenty of regrets. I do not think that you are willing to acknowledge them, but you ought to have them. I do not think you will acknowledge them. That is why we have got to do some regulation and reregulation. Take a look, Mr. Birnbaum, if you would, at your own assessment of what you did in 2007. You had a great year."
"Mr. Birnbaum","What page?"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 55c.\1\ Now, you had made a decision to shift the direction and go from a long position to a short position. And here is what you said, that the ``execution of strategies has clearly been a concerted team effort.'' Do you have this now, Mr. Birnbaum? Do you see where I am at?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 55c, which appears in the Appendix on page 447. "
"Mr. Birnbaum","I am catching up to you."
"Senator Levin","OK. Well, I will not make you catch up. I want you to read every word with me, so I will wait until your eyes are on the same words I am on."
"Mr. Birnbaum","So which page are you on?"
"Senator Levin","Page 2."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I am with you."
"Senator Levin","It says, ``Vision, risk taking, market calls.'' ``Whereas execution of strategies has clearly been a concerted team effort, I consider myself the initial or primary driver of the macro trading direction for the business.'' Got it? Macro trading direction for the business. Here is what you say. You made three major calls: ``December to February''--that is December 2006 to February 2007--``With the desk quite long and ABX trading down from par . . ., we had a rough start to the year.'' By the way, that year started in December. ``The prevailing opinion within the department was that we should just `get close to home' and pare down our long.'' This is what Mr. Sparks was talking about. There are differences in the department. Everyone does not agree. There is a difference of opinion. I am going to keep going. So there was some opinion that we ``should just get `close to home' and pare down our long.'' But you--and then reading at the bottom of the page, you had five reasons there why you should not just pare down, you ought to make a big bet going short. And then you said, ``I concluded that we should not only get flat, but get VERY''--capitalized--``short.'' That is not my emphasis. That is yours, that you should get very short. And what did you do? You began ``socializing'' the idea. You wanted to avoid group-think, so you independently went to a whole bunch of folks to see if anybody could poke holes in the plan. ``Although opinions varied on execution probability, primarily on the back-end, we all agreed the plan made sense.'' ``We all agreed the plan made sense.'' And then you socialized with Sparks and Ruzika, and what did you do? You ``implemented the plan by hitting on almost every single name CDO protection buying''--that means you are heading in the short direction--``in a 2-month period. Much of the plan began working by February . . . our very profitable year was underway.'' This is a very profitable year where you were working. You were betting against the market. You were going short. And then down at the bottom of that paragraph, ``Again, when the prevailing opinion in the department was to remain close to home, I pushed everyone on the desk to sell . . . aggressively and quickly.'' OK? You made a lot of money monetizing that. ``We sold billions of index and single name risk''--you sold them, and you cashed in. And here is what you said: ``when the index dropped 25 points in July, we had a blow-out profit and loss month, making over $1 billion that month.'' Now, what you said in the report is what happened. This is what you folks reported to the SEC. October 4, 2007. This is Exhibit 46.\1\ This is a letter from Goldman to the SEC. Take a look at the bottom of page 3.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 46, which appears in the Appendix on page 361.  ``t is important to note . . . that we are active traders of mortgage securities and loans and, as with any of the financial instruments we trade, at any point in time we may choose to take a directional view . . .'' That is your words, Goldman Sachs. You may choose to take a directional view."
"Mr. Birnbaum","This is Exhibit 46? I am just asking you."
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 46, bottom of page 3. I am not asking you this question. I am asking Mr. Sparks this question, or any of you. But basically making a statement and then asking if you want to respond to it. I mean, this is a statement of Goldman Sachs to the SEC. I am not sure you want to quibble on this one. But, in any event, October 4, 2007. So, ``at any point in time we may choose to take a directional view of the market and will express that view through the use of mortgage securities, loans and derivatives. Therefore, although we did have long balance sheet exposure to sub-prime securities in the past three years, albeit small exposure, our net risk position was variously either long or short depending on our changing view of the market.'' So your risk position was dependent on your changing view of the market. But now comes the line which we might as well all agree upon before the next two panels start--this is what you represented to the SEC and what the facts clearly show. ``For example''--presumably of your decision on directional view--``during most of 2007, we maintained a net short sub- prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market.'' Is there any doubt in your mind that was true? Is there any doubt in your mind that what Mr. Viniar said later on that year was also true? This is what Mr. Viniar said at the end of the third quarter. He is the Chief Financial Officer. This is Exhibit 45,\1\ by the way, if you want to track it.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 45, which appears in the Appendix on page 349.  ``Let me also address mortgages specifically''--this is the end of the third quarter. It was around September. ``The mortgage sector continues to be challenged and there is a broad decline in the value of mortgage inventory during the third quarter. As a result, we took significant markdowns on our long inventory positions during the quarter, as we had in the previous two quarters.'' That is getting out of the long position. And then he said the following: ``However, our risk bias in that market was to be short and that net short position was profitable.'' Do you disagree with that, Mr. Sparks? Do you disagree with that one statement?"
"Mr. Sparks","During the third quarter that we had a net short bias? I do not disagree with that statement."
"Senator Levin","And you disagree with this statement?"
"Mr. Sparks","I said I do not disagree. I am sorry."
"Senator Levin","Do you disagree with the statement that was made to the SEC, bottom of Exhibit 46, page 3, last line, that ``during most of 2007, we maintained a net short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market''? That was stated to the SEC. Was Goldman Sachs telling the truth to the SEC?"
"Mr. Sparks","I understand that. I did not write this."
"Senator Levin","All right. Mr. Birnbaum, do you know whether that was a true statement or not?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Again, these are not my words. I did not----"
"Senator Levin","I am just asking you if the statement is true that Goldman Sachs made to the SEC. That is all I am asking you."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, this is a long document. I mean, I have not even read it----"
"Senator Levin","I am asking you about that statement at the bottom of page 3, that ``during most of 2007, we maintained a net short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market.''"
"Mr. Birnbaum","There is only one thing I can comment on, and that is my position. And you read my self-review."
"Senator Levin","OK."
"Mr. Birnbaum","And I stand pat with what I wrote there, and----"
"Senator Levin","And is that review totally consistent with this?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Just to be clear, my review pertains to my business that I worked with----"
"Senator Levin","I got you. Is your review----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","This is only a small part of the firm."
"Senator Levin","Is your review consistent with what I just read?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","My review only----"
"Senator Levin","Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Birnbaum","My review only relates to my----"
"Senator Levin","I understand. Is this something that you agree was an accurate statement when Goldman Sachs made it to the Securities and Exchange Commission in October 2007?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Thank you."
"Mr. Swenson","And I would like to add the nature of our risk----"
"Senator Levin","Oh, I was just hoping for a yes."
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, but the nature of our risk changed over the course of that year, which I mentioned in my opening statement."
"Senator Levin","We understand. Thank you very much. Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for each of you that I would like just a yes or no answer. Is there a policy within Goldman Sachs that if you feel something is either out of the ordinary or unethical, that you are not to communicate that in an email? And have you ever been instructed on what you will or will not communicate on emails? In other words, are there things that you are not to communicate in emails? Mr. Sparks."
"Mr. Sparks","The ethical question, if there is something that you have an ethical question about, you are supposed to raise it to your superior. But with respect----"
"Senator Coburn","Have you ever been instructed not to raise that in an email?"
"Mr. Sparks","No."
"Senator Coburn","There is no policy within Goldman that you cannot raise ethical questions on emails?"
"Mr. Sparks","Not that I am aware of."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Birnbaum."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I am not aware of a policy like that."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Swenson","I am not aware of a policy."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Tourre."
"Mr. Tourre","I am not aware of a policy."
"Senator Coburn","Are you aware of any policy that would restrict your communication on emails about anything related to your business within Goldman? And, again, you all have been-- are under oath. All I want is a yes or no. Have you been instructed on certain things you will not communicate in an email relating to the business? I am not talking about personal now."
"Mr. Sparks","Within the firm, no. Personal stuff, the firm does not--prefers you not to, and then I would say there are things about what can go outside of Goldman that there are policies about."
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Birnbaum","It has been a little while since I worked there, and I do not remember all the policies. We had a lot of policy updates."
"Senator Coburn","Well, you would know this policy if it was there."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do not remember all the policies."
"Senator Coburn","So your answer is you do not know?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","My answer is, I do not remember all the policies."
"Senator Coburn","That is a very unsatisfactory answer."
"Mr. Swenson",""
"Mr. Swenson","There is no policy."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you."
"Mr. Tourre",""
"Mr. Tourre","There is no policy."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Thank you. I want to go just a little further on an email. If you all will look at Exhibit 26,\1\ this is an email dated July 25, 2007, from the executive VP and chief financial officer, and it was not necessarily communicated to you. This is a summary of revenues and estimates year to date, and this would be the estimate for revenues and estimate for pre-tax profit, and this goes to Mr. Cohn and copied to several others. It says, ``Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big short.'' It is not really fair to ask you to comment on that, but there were discussions about changing your positions in relationship to the mortgage market, the derivatives, and the packaged securities. There is no question about that, right? You all have testified you were changing position. Correct?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 26, which appears in the Appendix on page 306. "
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Everybody agrees with that? You were changing positions. You saw a market that was tanking. You were trying to limit your loss as good fiduciaries for your business, but also to balance that loss as a market maker. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","Can I just, Dr. Coburn, I thought you said we were changing our positions. We were oftentimes changing our positions. I thought you meant did----"
"Senator Coburn","I understand, but there has never been a position change like what took place in the last 4 years in this country in the mortgage markets. There has never been anything like that. Maybe when we shut off exports of commodities to the Russians during the Afghanistan invasion, but there has never been a change like that before in this country. So I understand you change positions all the time, but there has never been anything to compare to what happened in terms of the collateralized debt obligations and the residential mortgage-backed securities in this country. Would you agree with that? Do you know anything in your history? I am 62 years old. I have never seen anything like it."
"Mr. Sparks","It was definitely unique."
"Senator Coburn","I am not critical of it. It is smart, if you see a market tanking, to get out of the market. I mean, you are market makers, but you are also proprietary traders. So you are not only having to make a market, which puts you on exposure for some losses, but you also have proprietary trading, so you make more of your money now proprietary trading than you do any other way, at least the last few quarters you have. So it is a fact that you were changing positions as a firm in the mortgage-backed industry and the derivatives associated with that. Correct? Anybody disagree with that? I am taking it that means nobody disagrees."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I would just second what Mr. Sparks said. We were changing positions all the time."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Birnbaum, you did not hear what I just said. Everybody changed positions. As a matter of fact, they got so much change in their position they lost half of everything they owned, the vast majority of people who did not have access to the same data you did or were not smart enough to take care of it. So you cannot compare this change in position--this was a drastic change in position where you went significantly short on the basis of smart knowledge of what was going on in the market. You do not have to apologize for it, but do not compare it to a change in what the CPI might be one month over the next to changing positions. It is inappropriate, and it is also discourteous to us. We are not that stupid. Now, I am going to pass out for each of you copies of some things that are not in the reference binder, but they are copies of emails collected from your firm.\1\ Have they been passed out? So everybody has that, and I think our panel members have it as well.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 174, which appears in the Appendix on page   The first is related to Mr. Tourre, and I want you to go along with this and try to answer some of these questions for me, if you would. Tell me, in your mind what is an equity investor?"
"Mr. Tourre","It is a party who buys an equity position in a transaction."
"Senator Coburn","And describe an equity position. What are they buying, in your mind?"
"Mr. Tourre","They are buying the residual piece of a transaction."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And it may be long, it may be short, it may be a derivative, it may be a combined--or it may just be a pure equity, right? A stock."
"Mr. Tourre","It could be a stock."
"Senator Coburn","Right. OK. Did you ever tell ACA Paulson would be an equity investor?"
"Mr. Tourre","No."
"Senator Coburn","At no time did you infer that, tell them that, or state that, at any time with ACA?"
"Mr. Tourre","No, sir."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Did you tell ACA that Paulson was short on the deal? I am talking about the Abacus deal."
"Mr. Tourre","I do not specifically remember the words I used, but I did mention to ACA that Paulson's expectation was that they were buying credit protection on senior tranches of that portfolio."
"Senator Coburn","OK, but that is the same thing as saying they are going to buy a short position."
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","Was there ever any inference when you said that they were also taking a long position--that they were taking a long position and insure their long position by buying on the short side?"
"Mr. Tourre","To me, buying protection on senior layers of risk means being short."
"Senator Coburn","OK. So somebody would not necessarily buy long on the higher tranche and sell equity protection on the lower-quality tranche."
"Mr. Tourre","Correct."
"Senator Coburn","Nobody would do that?"
"Mr. Tourre","Correct."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Why wouldn't they? If the different tranches have different values, even though the whole thing is AAA rated, why would they not buy protection on the highest- risk portion of the deal?"
"Mr. Tourre","I am sorry. Can you repeat the question, Senator?"
"Senator Coburn","Why would somebody not buy protection on the lowest potential performing component of the deal and buy long on the top end of the deal?"
"Mr. Tourre","If somebody has an interest in buying protection on a portfolio, depending on the objectives from a carry perspective, that party may decide to buy protection on the first loss, the mezzanine, or the super-senior tranche. I think it is an investment decision that has to do with carry, and----"
"Senator Coburn","So they might straddle that for their own insurance, but that is it?"
"Mr. Tourre","Views on ultimate losses on the reference portfolio."
"Senator Coburn","Right. OK. Mr. Tourre, to your knowledge, of the securities that were kicked out by ACA of the Abacus deal, do you have any knowledge that anywhere in Goldman that they--once those were kicked out, that they bought a short position in the securities that were kicked out?"
"Mr. Tourre","I am sorry. Who bought a short position?"
"Senator Coburn","Goldman. Of the securities that were kicked out of the Abacus deal, do you have any knowledge anywhere available to you that anybody in Goldman created a short position on those securities that were kicked out?"
"Mr. Tourre","When you say ``kicked out,'' you are----"
"Senator Coburn","They were not part of the deal. In other words, ACA said, ``No, we are not taking these.'' Did anybody within Goldman take a short position on the ones that they were not included in the tranches?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not know, Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","Does anybody else have an answer for that question? Is there any knowledge anywhere about anybody knowing whether or not you specifically took short positions on portfolios that were rejected from the Abacus deal?"
"Mr. Sparks","Dr. Coburn, I do not know."
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Birnbaum","As I had mentioned earlier, I did not work on those transactions."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Mr. Swenson."
"Mr. Swenson","I do not know."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Thank you. Now to the documents. The first document is an email about a location--``Canceled: Meet with Paulson, potential equity investor.'' And this actually comes from Laura Schwartz, which is on January 8, 2007, 7:05 p.m. Laura is communicating to a gkreitman1@bloomberg.net, with a copy to Keith Gorman on a Paulson meeting. ``I have no idea how it went - I wouldn't say it went poorly, not at all, but I think it didn't help that we didn't know exactly how they want to participate in the space. Can you get me some feedback?'' She is talking about Paulson there, right? You have these in front of you, correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, sir."
"Senator Coburn","Is she talking about the Paulson group?"
"Mr. Tourre","I believe she is talking about the Paulson meeting, yes."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And then a phone call on January 10, 2007. Did you have that phone call?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not remember, Senator."
"Senator Coburn","You do not remember. All right. But it is in the record that it happened. You would agree to--this is your records."
"Mr. Tourre","I am sorry. When you say this is my----"
"Senator Coburn","These are not your records. I take it back. They are ACA records. On January 28, 2007, you have an email from Laura Schwartz to Alan Roseman and Ted Gilpin; subject: ``Not a boon doggle.'' And, again, the Abacus deal comes up at a per chance meeting in Colorado--no, in Wyoming. She went to a conference, hammered out collateral and structural issues on two deals with both the Paulson PM--does the PM refer to ``prime mover'' or ``principal maker'' or----"
"Mr. Tourre","Traditionally, it is ``portfolio manager.''"
"Senator Coburn","Portfolio manager, OK. That fits. And the Morgan Stanley proprietary head. ``The Paulson  wasn't even at the conference but came over to me in the mountain cafeteria and asked to get together.'' So here is a meeting between ACA and Paulson's portfolio manager, correct? You would agree that is what this implies?"
"Mr. Tourre","Reading this email right now, it looks like it, sir."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Thank you. So then back from Mr. Gorman to Laura Schwartz, ``Looks good to me. Did they give a reason why they kicked out all of the Wells deals?'' And then at the bottom of this email is, ``Attached is the revised portfolio that Paulson would like us to commit to - all names are at the Baa2 level. The final portfolio will have between 80 and these 92 names. Are `we' ok to say yes on this portfolio?'' OK. And, again, this is inside ACA documents. You probably have not been aware of this. And then Mr. Pellegrini with Paulson & Company sends to Laura Schwartz on February 13th, ``In answer to your question, the reasons we decided to go ahead with ACA are that, on the one hand, you have an impressive infrastructure and track record and, on the other hand, you are willing to execute a relatively less lucrative assignment with the same level of diligence and energy that you apply to all your deals. I also appreciated your direct personal involvement in selecting the deal's portfolio of reference obligations.'' Mr. Tourre, what does that say to you?"
"Mr. Tourre","Well, I have never seen this email before, so I am just----"
"Senator Coburn","But what would you infer from the fact that somebody at Paulson is saying that it was Ms. Schwartz who was directly personally involved in selecting the deal's portfolio of reference obligations?"
"Mr. Tourre","The way I read this email today is, Paolo Pellegrini is thanking Laura Schwartz for working on this transaction."
"Senator Coburn","Well, you do not think it is significant in light of the accusations that have been made about Abacus that a Paulson representative would imply in this email that he selected the deal's portfolio of reference obligations rather than them?"
"Mr. Tourre","Dr. Coburn, I think we went through this before. Goldman Sachs, Paulson, and IKB all made suggestions. I apologize because you were not here when I made my statement."
"Senator Coburn","Right."
"Mr. Tourre","But out of the initial list of obligations that Goldman Sachs and Paulson had identified, ACA removed more than half of them. So ultimately there is not a single obligation in the 07 AC-1 transaction, there is not one single one that was not selected by ACA."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Thank you. That is helpful. All right. Mr. Chairman, I am over my time. I will yield back."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Tourre, let me go back to where Dr. Coburn left off. When my staff talked to you, we asked you whether or not Paulson had established the portfolio selection criteria, such as FICO scores, loan-to-value ratios, etc. Was that true? And did you answer that was true, in fact?"
"Mr. Tourre","I think what I remember discussing with your staff, Mr. Chairman, is the fact that the very original portfolio that Paulson and Goldman discussed had been selected from a universe of 2006 vintage subprime RMBS obligations, removing, several obligations, and those obligations were removed based on certain criteria."
"Senator Levin","Right, and those criteria were selected by Paulson?"
"Mr. Tourre","As far as I can remember, yes."
"Senator Levin","And half of the portfolio was selected by Paulson then. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","Which portfolio are you referring to, Mr. Chairman?"
"Senator Levin","The Abacus."
"Mr. Tourre","The portfolio for Abacus 07 AC-1 was selected by ACA based on suggestions----"
"Senator Levin","Half of those items in the portfolio were suggestions that came from Paulson. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not remember the exact----"
"Senator Levin","You said they only used half of the suggestions. I am asking you--they did not use, you said--or they did use half. So either way, half of his suggestions were incorporated in the Abacus portfolio. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, I did not say half. I said more than half the securities were kicked out by ACA."
"Senator Levin","Kicked out, OK. So about what percentage of the securities were not kicked out?"
"Mr. Tourre","A small percentage."
"Senator Levin","A small percentage?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, Mr. Tourre, you misspoke."
"Mr. Tourre","Can you repeat the other question, Mr. Chairman?"
"Senator Levin","You said that more than half of the suggestions of Paulson & Company were not accepted by ACA. What percentage of their suggestions were accepted by ACA?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not remember the exact percentage, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Was it nearly half?"
"Mr. Tourre","Again, I do not remember."
"Senator Levin","Was it more than a few?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And this came to you as a reverse inquiry. Is that correct? Do you know what a reverse inquiry is?"
"Mr. Tourre","A reverse inquiry is a very loosely defined term. With respect to how I use it and how some of my colleagues use it, it is basically a party that comes in with a transaction idea and the party that basically drives a transaction."
"Senator Levin","And that party with the reverse inquiry is somebody who wants to sell short. Is that correct? Go short?"
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, it depends on the circumstances."
"Senator Levin","Well, is that what you mean by reverse, that the person that comes in--is that what is meant by that term?"
"Mr. Tourre","No, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","All right. Did Mr. Paulson or Paulson & Company come in wanting to go short?"
"Mr. Tourre","They came in and expressed an interest in buying protection on----"
"Senator Levin","Which means going short, right?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And did those criteria which Paulson gave to you, were they plugged into your model? Did they then generate a list of possible reference securities for that portfolio?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes. They were used to actually trim down the universe of RMBS."
"Senator Levin","Using his criteria. Now, take a look at Exhibit 152,\1\ if you would, Mr. Tourre. Do you see that, Exhibit 152?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 152, which appears in the Appendix on page 963. "
"Mr. Tourre","Is this the email from Michael Swenson to myself?"
"Senator Levin","It is from Michael Swenson--no. It is from you to Mr. Sparks."
"Mr. Tourre","Well, the first email----"
"Senator Levin","No, I am talking about the original message, the bottom."
"Mr. Tourre","Understood."
"Senator Levin","OK? Do you see where the second paragraph says, ``At the end of the meeting, the Paulson team''--this is you speaking--``told us that they were happy to have met''--and we do not put the name of the person in, obviously--``and assuming that (1) could get comfortable with a sufficient number of obligations that Paulson is looking to buy protection on in Abacus format.'' Do you see that, that he is looking to buy protection? That means to go short, right?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And those are your words, right?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","All right. Then take a look at Exhibit 107,\1\ the top of page 2. This is now the question of what managers are you going to work with. And do you see that at the top of page 2?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 107, which appears in the Appendix on page 677. "
"Mr. Tourre","One moment, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","OK."
"Mr. Tourre","Exhibit 107?"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 107, yes."
"Mr. Tourre","I am with you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","It says--well, first look on page 1, that you are looking for portfolio selection agents--and this is one of your criteria--who ``will be flexible with regard to portfolio selection . . . ideally we will send them a list of that fit certain criteria, and the portfolio selection agent will select 100 out of the 200 bonds'' that you send to them. Do you see your words there?"
"Mr. Tourre","I see my words, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Is that accurate? Did that reflect the facts at the time?"
"Mr. Tourre","This reflects the fact that we were----"
"Senator Levin","Was that accurate when you said it? Is that what you were looking for?"
"Mr. Tourre","The intention was to send a range of securities, to give some guidance to the portfolio selection agent."
"Senator Levin","And you were looking for an agent that would be flexible. Is that correct? That is your word?"
"Mr. Tourre","That is my word."
"Senator Levin","OK. Now, keep going. On page 2, by the way-- and this is from Geoffrey Williams to you. He said, ``There are more managers . . . than just . The way I look at it,'' he said--this is page 2 at the top--``the easiest managers to work with should be used for our own axes.'' In other words, I guess that means for Goldman's own goals instead of your clients'--here is another example where Goldman is putting themselves ahead of their own client, by the way. ``There are more managers out there than just . The way I look at it, the easiest managers to work with should be used for our own axes''--I think which means goals or our own ambitions. ``Managers that are a bit more difficult should be used for trades like Paulson given how axed Paulson seems to be (i.e. I'm betting they can give on certain terms and overall portfolio increase).'' So you think, hey, give the less flexible folks to our customers. We will save the more flexible for ourselves.'' Then you keep going. Take a look at Exhibit 112."
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, can I interrupt you one second?"
"Senator Levin","Sure."
"Mr. Tourre","With respect to your point about our own axes and your suggestion that they would be for--Goldman's own sort of use, if you will, again--and I do not remember the specific email, but the way I read it today is that there were transactions for which the best way to risk-manage those transactions was to re-offer the protection we were buying from the market directly in tranche format to certain investors."
"Senator Levin","I understand."
"Mr. Tourre","And there were other--and the other types of transactions and the other way we could risk-manage our risk was by writing single-name CDS protection on these obligations, and what I meant by, our own axes was I would rather risk- manage a tranche short with a basket of single-name credit default swap contracts."
"Senator Levin","OK."
"Mr. Tourre","So that is what I meant by this."
"Senator Levin","Now, take a look at--I said Exhibit 112, but I meant Exhibit 109.\1\ This is from Laura Schwartz at ACA to Gail Kreitman. Who is she?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 109, which appears in the Appendix on page 682. "
"Mr. Tourre","She is a salesperson who used to cover ACA."
"Senator Levin","For Goldman?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","So now ACA is writing Goldman. ``Gail, I certainly hope I didn't come across too antagonistic on the call with Fabrice last week but the structure looks difficult from a debt investor perspective. I can understand Paulson's equity perspective. . . .'' Where did they get that from?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not know, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Well, but Gail Kreitman sure was told that somehow or other Paulson had an equity perspective. Then she said, ``but for us to put our name on something, we have to be sure it enhances our reputation.'' So you do not know where ACA got the impression that Paulson was on the long side, right? You do not know where they got that?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not know, Mr. Chairman, but, again----"
"Senator Levin","Do you know where they got that impression?"
"Mr. Tourre","No, I do not know, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Now, take a look at Exhibit 108--well, we will skip that one. It is too long. Exhibit 118.\2\ This is the big formal memo that went to the Capital Committee from you, and a number of other people. This is what you said, on page 3, about the sixth line from the bottom. Do you see where it says, ``The Reference Portfolio has been selected and mutually agreed upon by ACA and Goldman''? Do you see that?  \2\ See Exhibit No. 118, which appears in the Appendix on page 713. "
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, I see that."
"Senator Levin","Was that true?"
"Mr. Tourre","Well, as I mentioned to your staff last week-- "
"Senator Levin","No, not staff. I am just asking you right now. Was that true, that statement that you sent to your own committee? Was that accurate?"
"Mr. Tourre","It is not very accurate. It could have been more accurate, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","It could have been what?"
"Mr. Tourre","It could have been more accurate."
"Senator Levin","I am not sure it could have been, but at any rate, you deny that is accurate."
"Mr. Tourre","I am saying it could have been more accurate."
"Senator Levin","Where was it inaccurate?"
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, before I answer that question, this was merely a copy paste from previous transactions where there was a portfolio manager involved."
"Senator Levin","Well, where is it inaccurate?"
"Mr. Tourre","Well, again, this could have been more accurate----"
"Senator Levin","No. I am saying where was it inaccurate?"
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, I did not say it was completely inaccurate."
"Senator Levin","Was it inaccurate in the reference to Goldman?"
"Mr. Tourre","Had I been----"
"Senator Levin","No. Are you claiming that was inaccurate now in reference to Goldman?"
"Mr. Tourre","I am claiming it is inaccurate in reference to the fact that it does not say exactly the----"
"Senator Levin","Was this portfolio mutually agreed upon by ACA and Goldman, yes or no?"
"Mr. Tourre","It was mutually agreed by Goldman, ACA, IKB, and Paulson."
"Senator Levin","All right. So you say it was mutually agreed upon by ACA and Goldman, you are saying that there were others that were left out."
"Mr. Tourre","Well, let me----"
"Senator Levin","And Paulson was left out. Is that correct? I think you have not answered the question the best you can, so let us go on. Take a look at Exhibit 123.\1\ Have you got it?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 123, which appears in the Appendix on page 843. "
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Do you see near the bottom there, it is an email from you to Josh Birnbaum? Do you see that?"
"Mr. Tourre","On page 1 or page 2, Mr. Chairman?"
"Senator Levin","Page 1 near the bottom."
"Mr. Tourre","Yes, I see that email."
"Senator Levin","It says here ``100  of the Baa2 RMBS selected by ACA/Paulson.'' Now, you are saying here that Paulson was one of the two people that selected this and the other was ACA. Was that an accurate statement?"
"Mr. Tourre","Mr. Chairman, I was responding to a specific question from Josh Birnbaum, and----"
"Senator Levin","I know. Was that accurate?"
"Mr. Tourre","With a view to actually type fast, I did not really----"
"Senator Levin","I know how fast----"
"Mr. Tourre","Write something accurate. What I should have written was that this was a portfolio selected by ACA with suggestions from Paulson, from Goldman Sachs, and from IKB. That would have been the factually correct statement. Here my objective was to write something quick to answer Josh, which was to answer a question that was more related to risk and risk management."
"Senator Levin","Right. But what you said then was that it was selected by ACA/Paulson, right? That is what you said at the time? Is that accurate--am I reading this accurately?"
"Mr. Tourre","That is what I wrote in this email, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","You now deny that it was accurate. Is that right?"
"Mr. Tourre","I am just saying----"
"Senator Levin","Was it accurate, yes or no?"
"Mr. Tourre","It could have been more accurate, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Let me just summarize this. You knew Paulson was on the short side of the trade. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","You knew Paulson had helped select the mortgages to be referenced. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","They made suggestions, yes."
"Senator Levin","And that a significant number of those suggestions were put into the document. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","I do not remember the exact number."
"Senator Levin","But you know that it is more than a few?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","You did not disclose to ACA that Paulson was on the short side of this deal. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","I did mention to ACA that the expectation was that Paulson was going to buy protection on senior layers of risk in the transaction."
"Senator Levin","That they were going to be only on the short side."
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","So you did say to ACA that Paulson was going to be on the short side of this transaction?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes. I do not remember the words, but I did mention that to ACA."
"Senator Levin","And was it reflected in the Goldman Sachs security offering to investors that Paulson had been part of the selection process? Was that represented in that document?"
"Mr. Tourre","Paulson was not disclosed in the Abacus 07 AC-1 transaction, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","It was not?"
"Mr. Tourre","No, it was not."
"Senator Levin","Did Goldman intend to keep a long stake in that transaction when the deal was structured? I know it ended up with a piece. Was it intended that it end up with a piece of that deal?"
"Mr. Tourre","We tried to hedge our risk by selling that piece as well, but were not successful in doing so."
"Senator Levin","So it was intended to sell that piece?"
"Mr. Tourre","For prudent risk management reasons, we were trying----"
"Senator Levin","Oh, I am sure for all the right reasons. But it was intended that Goldman not have any long stake on that piece. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Tourre","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","I just have a couple of other questions. Mr. Birnbaum, if you would turn to Exhibit 55c,\1\ your self-review, page 3 of your 2007 review: ``I have been the primary proponent of trading related equity names on the ABS desk.'' Can you tell me what that means?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 55c, which appears in the Appendix on page 447. "
"Mr. Birnbaum","Just let me get the exhibit first. You are on which page of the review?"
"Senator Coburn","Page 3."
"Mr. Birnbaum","OK."
"Senator Coburn","You state there, ``I have been the primary proponent of trading related equity names on the ABS desk.'' In plain English, what does that mean?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","That refers to trading equities as part of our hedging strategy."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Were you involved in or did you direct Goldman taking short positions on companies with exposures in the mortgage meltdown?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do not remember the names that we used as part of our--specific names as part of our hedging strategy, but as part of our macro hedging strategy, we did use primarily put options on equities as a component of what we did."
"Senator Coburn","You bought puts?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","We bought puts."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And you do not remember any of the names of the companies that you bought puts in?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","It was a while ago. I do not remember the specifics."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Exhibit 156 \1\ is a report in an email addressed to you dated March 28, 2007. It is a breakdown of Goldman Sachs' risk exposure to various companies.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 156, which appears in the Appendix on page 972. "
"Mr. Birnbaum","OK."
"Senator Coburn","Do you ever recall receiving something like this?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do not remember seeing this."
"Senator Coburn","But it was an email addressed to you?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I can confirm that, just looking at it here."
"Senator Coburn","OK. That email to me reflects that Goldman took a short position on Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, your former competitors. Is that what that would indicate?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","There is a lot of information in this email. It looks----"
"Senator Coburn","I will wait for you to assess it."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I see those names on this email."
"Senator Coburn","Were you responsible for those positions since you were the director of that?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I do not know if these names were as a result of my trading or someone else's trading within the firm."
"Senator Coburn","Well, it would certainly look like it would be since the email is directed to you. Go to Exhibit 155, if you would.\2\  \2\ See Exhibit No. 155, which appears in the Appendix on page 971. "
"Mr. Birnbaum","There are a lot of other people in this email."
"Senator Coburn","I understand, but you are the one that took credit in your own self-evaluation that you are the one that is responsible for that strategy."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Which I think is--just to give you some background, I mean, that is a perfectly----"
"Senator Coburn","I am not saying there is anything wrong with the strategy. I did not say that."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Exhibit 155?"
"Senator Coburn","Yes."
"Mr. Birnbaum","OK."
"Senator Coburn","This is a document that reflects that the biggest piece of Timberwolf was purchased by a division of what was formerly Bear Stearns, $300 million worth. Does this document show that Goldman took a short position on Bear Stearns?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Exhibit 155?"
"Senator Coburn","Yes."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I think Exhibit 155, which--is this an email or is this--what is this?"
"Senator Coburn","Well, it is in front of you."
"Mr. Birnbaum","OK. It is not an email. I have never seen this report before."
"Senator Coburn","I did not say it was an email. I said it was a document."
"Mr. Birnbaum","OK. I have never seen this document before."
"Senator Coburn","Do you have any recollection at all of ever recommending the short on Bear Stearns or buying a put?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I do recall, yes."
"Senator Coburn","OK. So here is the question I have for you, and I am not saying it is not fair, but I want to get your assessment. You are looking at what you see is a change in residential backed mortgage securities. You are changing positions within Goldman. At the same time, you are selling them Timberwolf, which you are now seeing and you are buying stuff on the other side of, which was used with a fairly humorous description by some in your sales department, and now you are carrying that even further by shorting a company that bought your product because the thinking is it is a smart way to hedge because you are already betting against it inside on a CDO product, and they have got $300 million of it, and you do not think it is going to be worth much, so it might mean that their stock is going to decline. Is that an accurate assessment of the trading strategy?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Absolutely not."
"Senator Coburn","OK. What was the indication for the trading--why would you short Bear Stearns after they had just bought $300 million worth of Timberwolf from you?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, keep in mind the Timberwolf transactions were not part of my job function."
"Senator Coburn","Were you aware of Timberwolf sales?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I heard the name Timberwolf. I was not----"
"Senator Coburn","You had no knowledge that Bear Stearns had exposure to multiple mortgage-backed securities?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I never had knowledge of that."
"Senator Coburn","So what did you base the idea that you would short a Bear Stearns for?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","When I spoke earlier, I used the word ``macro'' to describe some of those hedges, and sort of inherent in that description is that I had a portfolio of several names that I felt that would have some exposure----"
"Senator Coburn","More downside risk than others?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, keep in mind when you buy a put, you are not just betting on downside, you are also betting on uncertainty. And at the time there was a lot of uncertainty in the market as to which way the market was going to go, and you can buy insurance, buy a put----"
"Senator Coburn","I understand."
"Mr. Birnbaum","And that can be a very effective hedge against a portfolio. You are not necessarily betting----"
"Senator Coburn","Just as selling the call can be."
"Mr. Birnbaum","But you are not necessarily betting the market is going to go down, and I agree, just like a call can be."
"Senator Coburn","OK. All right. So you do not see any connection between Goldman's position in mortgage underwriting sophisticated instruments and your position looking at a macro sense of what you see happening there and taking and shorting your competitors or buying a put insurance against your competitors?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","None at all."
"Senator Coburn","There is no connection?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","No connection."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And you had never had any conversation within the firm about that connection when--do you deny any knowledge that the firm had taken a significant change in position in terms of mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, CDOs and CDS?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I can only speak----"
"Senator Coburn","Were you aware of----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","I am aware of my position."
"Senator Coburn","Were you aware of the firm's position that was communicated widely through a lot of emails?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, most of those emails I was not on."
"Senator Coburn","I did not ask you that. I said were you aware."
"Mr. Birnbaum","I was not aware of what the firm as a whole was--what the firm's position on mortgages was. The only thing I was aware of is the firm asked me to be a good risk manager."
"Senator Coburn","Right, OK. And I think----"
"Mr. Birnbaum","And I was long----"
"Senator Coburn","You probably were. But I cannot believe that when you execute a strategy to take advantage of greater knowledge within your firm to increase the return for your firm that you can at the same time sit there and tell you are not taking advantage of the knowledge from the other areas of the firm. You cannot have a strategy both ways. You are going to say we can build a strategy based on this, but we are not going to take any information inside the firm to make those decisions. I mean, that is not plausible."
"Mr. Birnbaum","It is plausible because that is what happened."
"Senator Coburn","In other words, without any knowledge--you had no knowledge that the firm took any short positions in the mortgage-backed security business?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, that is not what you asked me. You asked me----"
"Senator Coburn","I am asking you that now."
"Mr. Birnbaum","You asked me regarding Timberwolf."
"Senator Coburn","I am asking you about mortgage-backed securities. Were you aware that the firm had changed its position? You were testifying before--you jumped in when I was asking Mr. Sparks--that you do change positions. I understand that."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Right, and, again, I do not speak for the firm. I speak for my position. So I was not aware of any firm- wide guidance as to a direction on the mortgage market."
"Senator Coburn","So you would not think it would be prudent for somebody in risk management like you to maximize a position for Goldman Sachs to take advantage of that information and then make decisions about your competitors who were long in these areas?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Sorry. Which information?"
"Senator Coburn","The information of the fact that the housing market, the prices in the housing market, as you testified earlier, as an indicator, that you were seeing softness in that market, you were seeing a decelerating increase in prices, then you saw a flat price, then you saw a deceleration of price."
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I think taking publicly available information and trading a publicly traded equity is perfectly fine----"
"Senator Coburn","But that is counter to what you were promoting yourself and your own deal, that you were going to expand the use and leverage the use of the knowledge within the firm. All I am asking you is you did not use any of the knowledge anywhere else in the firm to advantage your ability to make a better return as a risk management?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","You were asking me about a specific----"
"Senator Coburn","No. I am asking you what I just asked you. You did not at any time use other information within the firm of what was going on, the coffee talk, everything else, all the emails, the positions, the SEC reports, the internal management report, you never at any time used that to enhance your ability to make Goldman money?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","The typical way that I would synchronize with other people within the firm was with a research group that might help me in the evaluation of some of these securities."
"Senator Coburn","Well, the research group would certainly know about whether or not the firm had been advised to take a different position in terms of collateralized debt obligations and residential mortgage-backed securities?"
"Mr. Birnbaum","Well, I was not advised of that, and I am not sure why they would be advised of that. I am not sure we have even established that there was a firm-wide change in position."
"Senator Coburn","Well, we will let the record speak to that. All right. I will give up on that."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Swenson, would you look at Exhibit 160?\1\ Do you have it?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 160, which appears in the Appendix on page 983. "
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","This is a financial summary. Take a look at page 2 where it says ``Mortgages.'' Do you see where it says ``Mortgages Performance.'' Do you see that box?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, up top."
"Senator Levin","It says there what your performance was for the year to date, YTD. Do you see that?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And then SPG. What does that stand for? Structured Products Group?"
"Mr. Swenson","That is correct."
"Senator Levin","And were you the co-head of that group?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And that group made, as I understand it, $3.7 billion on the short side, basically, right?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And the first three items there, residential prime, residential credit, and CDO-CLO, those were mainly from the old inventory, I gather, and they continued to lose money. That was the long that had been previously dragging the company down. And if you look at what was lost on that side of it, residential prime, residential credit, CDO, when you add those three together, those losses come to $2.9 billion. Does that look about right to you?"
"Mr. Swenson","It looks about right."
"Senator Levin","So you guys made $3.7 billion that year. The previous year's inventory, mainly, was deducted from that in order to come up with the total performance. But that is where that revenue number of $1.130 billion comes from, is that correct?"
"Mr. Swenson","As it is broken out on this sheet, yes."
"Senator Levin","Who put this sheet together? This is your sheet, isn't it? Isn't this a Goldman Sachs sheet that you helped put together?"
"Mr. Swenson","It is a sheet that I am not familiar with."
"Senator Levin","All right. Do those numbers look right to you?"
"Mr. Swenson","We are going back a number of years----"
"Senator Levin","Well, did your group have a pretty good year for 2007?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes, we had a pretty good year that year."
"Senator Levin","Did you start off that year with a value at risk number?"
"Mr. Swenson","The VaR was not broken out on the ABS Desk. It was broken out----"
"Senator Levin","It was broken out according to what?"
"Mr. Swenson","The business lines, the Mortgage Department line."
"Senator Levin","The mortgage line. So the Mortgage Department had a VaR at the beginning of the year, right?"
"Mr. Swenson","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Do you know what it was?"
"Mr. Swenson","No, I do not recall."
"Senator Levin","Do you remember what it was about?"
"Mr. Swenson","I remember what it was about, but I don't know----"
"Senator Levin","At the beginning."
"Mr. Swenson","A specific number. Since we are talking about----"
"Senator Levin","How does 20 or 30 sound to you?"
"Mr. Swenson","I don't know."
"Senator Levin","Well, it was around 20 at the beginning."
"Mr. Swenson","And, Mr. Chairman, where are you getting that number----"
"Senator Levin","The Mortgage Department."
"Mr. Swenson","Where are you getting that number, Mr. Chairman?"
"Senator Levin","From your numbers."
"Mr. Swenson","No, but in this book."
"Senator Levin","I don't know that we have it in the book. "
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 164.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 164, which appears in the Appendix on page  "
"Mr. Swenson","Thank you."
"Senator Levin","That red line there, that is your permanent VaR limit."
"Mr. Sparks","Mr. Chairman, would it be helpful if I helped on this point, because----"
"Senator Levin","I don't know that you have been very helpful on too many points, but give it another try."
"Mr. Sparks","OK. With respect to risk in the overall Mortgage Department, I would have been responsible for that number----"
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Sparks","So I might have more information."
"Senator Levin","The VaR for the overall Mortgage Department started off, it looks like, in December at around 20. It went up to a little over 30, and that was your permanent VaR limit, is that right?"
"Mr. Sparks","Yes, but I would like to point out, Mr. Chairman, that with respect to how I managed risk in our mortgage business----"
"Senator Levin","I am just asking if that was your permanent limit."
"Mr. Sparks","I don't recall what my permanent limit was because I didn't use VaR as a primary risk measurement or management tool."
"Senator Levin","Somebody else did, didn't they, in the firm? Someone else was using VaRs as a risk measurement, weren't they?"
"Mr. Sparks","That is correct. That is what the firm overall uses."
"Senator Levin","Right."
"Mr. Sparks","But I wanted to be clear with respect----"
"Senator Levin","Your department was given a permanent limit by the firm, is that correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","We had limits, and until things started to vary, they usually weren't an issue and----"
"Senator Levin","But you guys wanted to take a heck of a lot more risk on shorts, and that is, according to your own numbers, what happened, huge bets on shorts so that your VaR limit was allowed to go up to 100, which was at one point more than half of the whole risk the firm was taking, although you were only around 2 or 3 percent of the income of that firm. So that red line there, that was supposed to be the prescribed limit. That was the limit on the risk, a very cautious, prescribed limit. But that other line that is blue or green--I can't see from here--but the line that looks like mountains, those were big excesses above your VaR limit. It went way up there in February, all the way to 100. Then you cashed in on those shorts, it came down--you made billions there--went up in August to over 100, and then gradually came down and settled by the end of the year at something like 80. So you had a permanent limit of something between 20 to 30 that the leaders of the firm said was the right limit for the Mortgage Department, but you were allowed to go so far short that your risk limit and your short position pulled you up to a VaR, a value at risk number, that was probably unheard of, by the way, but represented more than half the risk that the firm was taking. We think 56 percent of the total risk of the firm was in your department, which was producing 2 percent of the revenue. Does that sound right to you?"
"Mr. Sparks","Chairman Levin, I think this is a very important point with respect to VaR and the mortgage business-- "
"Senator Levin","But just the numbers. Do the numbers sound right to you?"
"Mr. Sparks","VaR, with respect to the mortgage business, had some fundamental flaws, including not all the products were included, especially many of the long positions. The firm continually worked to improve that. I mentioned that we had made mistakes in the past and one of those mistakes was we had not invested enough with respect to this to have that accurately reflect our risk."
"Senator Levin","OK."
"Mr. Sparks","As the market got more volatile, that number moved up a lot. So when I said that was not the primary tool I used with respect to managing the risk in the department, that is accurate. That doesn't mean I didn't ignore it and that doesn't mean that the firm----"
"Senator Levin","That doesn't mean you did ignore it?"
"Mr. Sparks","No, it doesn't mean that I didn't ignore the VaR----"
"Senator Levin","Did not or did?"
"Mr. Sparks","I meant to say, I had to pay attention to the VaR because it affected the firm's overall VaR, so we had two issues to deal with: One, a flawed measurement that we had to try and work with, and the second was, though, it was still a very big number that was creating issues with respect to the firm."
"Senator Levin","Right, and the senior management was using the VaR, is that correct?"
"Mr. Sparks","The senior management was using the VaR and the senior--but the senior management understood my concerns that that was not reflective of what our risk was."
"Senator Levin","All right. In any event, using that measurement which you were using, it started off in January 2007 somewhere around 20, and then your permanent limit was at 30, and that is what happened. That is what you were allowed to do on the short. That reflects the short positions that you took. That is how big a short position you folks took. You made billions. At the same time, in many cases, and we have laid out many of them here, where you were taking short positions, you were selling securities to your customers, taking short positions on a number of those securities. We have laid out a number of those today in this morning's hearing. I think there is a clear conflict of interest when that happens. There is a big conflict of interest question that has to do with when you are betting big time against a whole market. Should your clients and customers know that? That is one issue. But for heaven's sake, it should be abundantly clear that when you are selling securities to clients and customers, that they should know that you are betting against those same securities. And what happened during that year is that you were making a lot of money, in the billions, from your short positions betting against the market and against securities that you were selling to customers. That is, I think, intolerable. There is a fundamental conflict of interest that needs to be addressed. We obviously have to address it either by legislation or by regulation, and unless Dr. Coburn has additional questions, I will----"
"Senator Coburn","I just want to make one remark to temper yours. Markets have to have people on both sides of them. My concern is where is the ethical standard on when you expose your position as a market maker and does there need to be some refinement in that so that people can see, transparency and trust and truth in a market."
"Senator Levin","No, I agree totally with that, and with that positive note, you will be excused and we will stand in recess for 10 minutes. "
"Senator Levin","We will now move to our second panel of witnesses for today's hearing, David Viniar, an Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs, and Craig Broderick, the Chief Risk Officer of Goldman Sachs. We appreciate your being with us today. Pursuant to the rules of this Subcommittee, which you are familiar with, I believe, all witnesses who testify before us are required to be sworn in. At this time, I would ask you both to please stand and raise your right hands. Do you swear that the testimony you are about to give to this Subcommittee will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?"
"Mr. Viniar","I do."
"Mr. Broderick","I do."
"Senator Levin","The timing system today will give you a red light in about 5 minutes and a yellow light in about 4 minutes so that you would have a chance to hopefully give us your oral testimony in 5 minutes. Mr. Viniar, we will have you go first, and then Mr. Broderick, and then we will go to questions. Thank you again for joining us. Mr. Viniar. "
"TESTIMONY OF DAVID A. VINIAR,\1\ EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., NEW YORK, NEW YORK"," "
"Mr. Viniar","Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Coburn, and Members of the Subcommittee, good afternoon. My name is David Viniar. I have been Chief Financial Officer of Goldman Sachs since 1999. I am responsible for risk management, financial control and reporting, and financing our business, among other duties. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before the Subcommittee and I will comment here on our risk philosophy and our approach to risk management.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Viniar appears in the Appendix on page 216.  As a global investment bank and financial intermediary, Goldman Sachs integrates advice and capital with its risk management capabilities to serve a broad range of largely institutional clients. In doing so, we often take on principal risk to help clients achieve their objectives. For example, we may facilitate block offerings, provide structured solutions, or extend credit. We routinely evaluate, price, and distribute risk across the spectrum according to the specific risk appetites of our institutional clients. We know that we will sometimes incur losses, but as a core part of our business model, we proactively manage our risk to minimize these losses. When we commit capital to buy or sell financial instruments, extend credit, or invest alongside our clients, we accumulate both long and short positions that give rise to liquidity, credit, and market risks. We deploy a range of risk management capabilities to price the risks of each transaction appropriately, keep the firm's overall exposures within risk limits, and establish offsetting positions, or sell and buy positions, as necessary to control overall exposure. Our approach is to understand the risks we are taking, analyze and quantify them, and keep a firm grip on their current market value. We carry virtually our entire inventory of financial instruments at fair market value, with changes reflected in our daily P&L. Such daily marking of our positions was a key reason we decided to start reducing our mortgage risk as market conditions were deteriorating at the end of 2006. I would like to give you a sense for how we managed our risk during the period leading up to the crisis. Through the end of 2006, we were generally long in exposure to residential mortgages and mortgage-related products. In that December, however, we began to experience a pattern of daily losses in our mortgage-related P&L. P&L can itself be a very valuable risk metric and I personally read it every day. I called a meeting to discuss the situation with the key people involved in running the mortgage business. We went through our positions and debated views on the mortgage market in considerable detail. While we came to no definitive conclusion about how the overall market would develop in the future, we became collectively concerned about the higher volatility and recent price declines in our subprime mortgage- related positions. As a result, we decided to attempt to reduce our exposure to these positions. We wanted to get closer to home. We proceeded to sell certain positions outright and hedge our long positions in an attempt to achieve these results. As always, the clients who bought our long positions or other similar positions had a view that they were attractive positions to purchase at the price they were offered. As with our own views, their views sometimes proved to be correct and sometimes incorrect. We continued to reduce our positions in these products over the course of 2007. We were generally successful in reducing this exposure to the extent that, on occasion, our portfolio traded short. When that happened, even if these short positions were profitable, given the ongoing high volatility and uncertainty in the market, we tended to attempt to then reduce these short positions to again get closer to home. This situation reversed itself in 2008, however, when the portfolio tended to trade long, and as a result, despite the fact that our franchise enabled the firm to be profitable overall, we lost money on residential mortgage-related products in that year. While the tremendous volatility in the mortgage market caused periodic large losses on long positions and large gains on offsetting short positions, the net of which could have appeared to be a substantial gain or loss on any day, in aggregate, these positions had a comparatively small effect on our net revenues. In 2007, total net revenues from residential mortgage- related products, both longs and shorts together, were less than $500 million, approximately 1 percent of Goldman Sachs's overall net revenues. And in 2007 and 2008 combined, our net revenues in this area were actually negative. For Goldman Sachs, weathering the mortgage market meltdown had nothing to do with prescience or betting on or against anything. More mundanely, it had everything to do with systematically marking our positions to market, paying attention to what those marks were telling us, and maintaining a disciplined approach to risk management. Thank you, and I am happy to take your questions."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much. Mr. Broderick. "
"TESTIMONY OF CRAIG W. BRODERICK,\1\ CHIEF RISK OFFICER, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., NEW YORK, NEW YORK"," "
"Mr. Broderick","Thank you, Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Coburn, and Members of the Subcommittee. Good afternoon. My name is Craig Broderick. I have been the Chief Risk Officer of Goldman Sachs since 2007 and prior to that was the Chief Credit Officer. I am responsible in this capacity for credit, market, operational risk, and insurance.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Broderick appears in the Appendix on page 221.  In summarizing my written submissions, I will focus my remarks on the firm's risk management framework to supplement David Viniar's comments on the topic and look forward to addressing your questions in more detail. As noted by Mr. Viniar, the nature of our role as financial intermediary requires a willingness to take risk on behalf of our clients. We seek to do so only within very carefully calibrated limits which are in line with our overall financial resources. Our clients expect us to facilitate transactions for them in all market conditions, and as such, the better that we understand and can manage risk, the more willing we are to transact with clients regardless of our views on markets. Our risk management framework has a number of core components. The central tenet is our daily discipline of marking all the firm's financial assets and liabilities to current market levels. We do so because we believe that it is one of the most effective tools for assessing and managing risk, providing the best insights into our positions and associated exposures. Goldman Sachs, as Mr. Viniar noted, is one of the few financial institutions in the world that carries virtually all financial instruments held in its inventory at current market value, with any changes reflected immediately in our risk management systems. The second core component is independence. Professionals in our risk management and key control functions have complete independence from their counterparts in the revenue generating divisions. This uncompromised independence, which exists in practice as well as in concept, gives teeth to the firm's risk management approach. The third is governance. The firm's governance structure provides the protocol and responsibility for decision making and implementation on risk management issues. A fourth component is our use of risk systems. We have developed and employed robust technology to track a variety of risk metrics across all the firm's trading businesses. And finally, our limit structure. The firm applies a rigorous limits framework to control our risk across multiple trades, products, businesses, and markets. These limits are monitored on a daily basis and they serve to maintain and promote constant dialogue between our traders and our risk managers, as well as the escalation of risk-related matters. Taken together, these core elements enable us to make informed decisions on a real-time basis about the risks we are taking and to rapidly attempt to make adjustments when necessary. We employ a variety of risk metrics and measures. In the case of market risk, value at risk (VaR), and Credit Spread Widening are frequently referenced. Both are highly useful, but both suffer from limitations as, in fact, do all risk metrics, which is why we apply multiple measures to assess the overall risk in our portfolio. These limitations can show up especially acutely during abnormal market conditions, such as characterized the 2007 through 2008 period. For example, VaR is highly dependent on market volatility of the underlying trade or product, and during 2007, volatility reached unprecedented levels in some products, in particular, in subprime mortgages. This had the effect of increasing our mortgage-related VaR by many multiples, despite the underlying portfolios in many cases actually decreasing. Between late 2006 and February 2007, daily VaR in the Mortgage Department increased from $13 million to $85 million. We estimate that much of this increase was the result of increases in volatility, as our underlying positions in many cases declined. Accordingly, an accurate assessment of the level and direction of risk in our mortgage business was and is a matter of expert judgment, with the ultimate validation coming only after the fact when we could see how the actual portfolio moved in response to market conditions. While we were relatively successful in flattening our risk, it involved a process of continual portfolio adjustments and interpretations. For example, during much of 2007, our VaR showed that our overall portfolio risk was increasing and reflecting a short position, whereas our Credit Spread Widening measures showed the opposite in terms of direction. During such periods, it was ultimately the experience of our business and risk management professionals and their appreciation for the nuances of each of these measures that helped guide the firm in assessing its exposures and maintaining risk within prudent levels. Particularly in light of events in the last 2 years, it is clear that no approach to risk management was foolproof and we have all learned valuable lessons from the recent experiences. However, we do believe the core elements that make up our risk management framework are broadly effective, despite the unprecedented turmoil in the markets. Thank you, and we look forward to answering any questions you may have."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Broderick. Mr. Viniar, Goldman Sachs issued a public statement, Exhibit 161,\1\ this past weekend which said that ``Goldman Sachs did not take a large directional `bet' against the U.S. housing market, and the firm was not consistently or significantly net `short the market' in residential mortgage products in 2007 and 2008.'' Our investigation focused on 2007, when the bubble burst, were you significantly net short in the market in residential-related products in 2007?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 161, which appears in the Appendix on page 985. "
"Mr. Viniar","Mr. Chairman, I would answer that by saying, across 2007, we were primarily, although not consistently short, and it was not a large short."
"Senator Levin","Was it a short that exceeded your permanent VaR?"
"Mr. Viniar","Well, limit structures at Goldman Sachs are put in place and occasionally we will bump up against them. In 2007, unfortunately, with the mortgage business, it was more than occasionally. And as Mr. Broderick talked about in his opening statement, the VaR increased quite dramatically early in the year and then throughout the year, largely based on the fact that the markets were so volatile that it was almost a little bit like salmon swimming upstream. No matter how fast we tried to reduce positions, the volatility increased at a faster pace, and therefore the VaR kept going up."
"Senator Levin","And did your short positions make a lot of money in 2007?"
"Mr. Viniar","The short positions themselves made a lot of money in 2007, but they offset long positions that lost a lot of money in 2007."
"Senator Levin","And those long positions had come to a significant degree from the inventory, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","Some of them had come from the inventory we had coming into the year. Over the course of the year, in our role as market maker, we also bought more positions."
"Senator Levin","Right. But do you know what percentage of those positions came from the inventory which were at least a year old?"
"Mr. Viniar","I do not."
"Senator Levin","According to the figures which we got, net profits from shorts, $3.7 billion. Net losses from longs, including the inventory pieces, which had been there for some time, were $2.9 billion. So you would agree that you were in a net short position for most of the year? Would you agree to that?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Levin","And would you not agree that it was a significant position, those short positions, since they were way above your VaR?"
"Mr. Viniar","I would not agree that it was a significant net short position----"
"Senator Levin","No. Was it a significant short position?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, it was a significant short position, but it offset a significant long position."
"Senator Levin","Yes. So you were significantly positioned in shorts during 2007, is that accurate?"
"Mr. Viniar","Not net----"
"Senator Levin","I didn't say net. I said, your short position in 2007 was significant and consistent. Is that true?"
"Mr. Viniar","We had large short positions, but they offset large long positions."
"Senator Levin","I understand that. I am not asking you now about the net. I am asking you about your short positions. You had a significant short position, significant and consistently in 2007, is that true?"
"Mr. Viniar","In the mortgage market?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","Just on that side?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Your public statements from the firm, I have got to tell you, give a totally different impression. That is my statement----"
"Mr. Viniar","Can I----"
"Senator Levin","Because you parse words. You talk about net. Obviously, you lost money from your long positions, much of which came out of the inventory. But you also then add 2008 to give yourself a hedge. You guys are good at hedging, but your words, when you tell the public that you did not significantly net short the market in residential mortgage-related products in 2007 and 2008 is misleading, because you had a significant short position in residential mortgage-related positions in 2007. That is a fact, which I think you will agree to."
"Mr. Viniar","But I don't believe our words are misleading because we only had that significant net short because we had a significant net long. If we had not had the significant net long, we would not--significant long, we would not have had a significant short."
"Senator Levin","Didn't you make a decision in December 2006 to basically head in a different direction? You were much too long and you wanted to go short. Is that not true?"
"Mr. Viniar","No. In December 2006, we made a decision to reduce risk."
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Viniar","That decision was not directional. It did not say that we should go long or go short."
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Viniar","It didn't say we shouldn't, and it didn't say we should take no risk. But it said that we should reduce risk."
"Senator Levin","Now, on October 4, 2007, Exhibit 46,\1\ you wrote the SEC. Page 3, at the bottom. You say that ``t is important to note that we are active traders of mortgage securities and loans and, as with any of the financial instruments we trade, at any point in time, we may choose to take a directional view of the market and will express that view through the use of mortgage securities, loans, and derivatives.''--We may choose to take a directional view of the market.--``Therefore although we did have a long balance sheet exposure''--long balance sheet exposure--``to sub-prime securities in the past three years, albeit small exposure, our net risk position was variously either long or short depending on our changing view of the market.'' You had a changing view of the market.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 46, which appears in the Appendix on page 361.  ``For example,'' now this is the example of choosing to take a directional view of the market, ``during most of 2007, we maintained a net short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market.'' Was that true when you said it?"
"Mr. Viniar","Absolutely, and totally consistent with what I said to you before."
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Viniar","We were largely short across 2007----"
"Senator Levin","Fine----"
"Mr. Viniar","Not consistently, and not large."
"Senator Levin","You were consistently short. As a matter of fact, you were very short. But you were consistently short in 2007. I mean, look at your own numbers. Look at your own chart, Exhibit 56.\2\ Look at your own chart.  \2\ See Exhibit No. 56, which appears in the Appendix on page 455. "
"Mr. Broderick","Is that the VaR chart that you were referencing earlier, Mr. Chairman?"
"Senator Levin","Your own VaR chart, not the one we took--you are looking right at it."
"Mr. Viniar","Exhibit 56."
"Senator Levin","Yes. Do you see that dark line there? What is the number you are looking at?"
"Mr. Viniar","Exhibit 56."
"Senator Levin","OK. Do you see that bottom line? That is adding up a bunch of lines. Do you see that, that dark red line there?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","OK. And that is the total, that is the net of the various positions. It is way below the line. Do you see that line in the middle there that looks like a railroad track?"
"Mr. Viniar","I do."
"Senator Levin","That total is consistently below zero, home, throughout the whole year. Is that true?"
"Mr. Viniar","It is, but I believe this is the SPG desk only."
"Senator Levin","That is the SPG desk. But is it any different from mortgages?"
"Mr. Viniar","Sure. It is only part of the Mortgage Department. And again, this was offsetting many of the other longs that we had."
"Senator Levin","We are talking here--this is net short."
"Mr. Viniar","But this is only one department within the Mortgage Department. This is only one business----"
"Senator Levin","This is net short. This is all synthetics across the Mortgage Department, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am looking at----"
"Senator Levin","Take a look at your own chart."
"Mr. Viniar","I know, but I don't know----"
"Senator Levin","RMBS----"
"Mr. Viniar","I am just reading it----"
"Senator Levin","Subprime notional history. Do you see that?"
"Mr. Viniar","This says, mortgage New York City SPG portfolio, so I don't know if there are others, but I believe this is just the SPG portfolio."
"Senator Levin","All right. Take a look at Exhibit 56b.\1\ ``The attached spreadsheet covers the single name and ABX positions of the entire Mortgage Department for the fiscal year   \1\ See Exhibit No. 56b, which appears in the Appendix on page 456. "
"Mr. Viniar","OK."
"Senator Levin","And it says, ``Understood. . . . the portfolio name is confusing. SPG portfolio in fact covers the entire mortgage department synthetic positions.'' OK?"
"Mr. Viniar","I see that. Yes."
"Senator Levin","Have you got it? That shows you----"
"Mr. Viniar","But again, this is only the synthetic positions. It does not include the cash long positions that we had----"
"Senator Levin","It does not include any long positions."
"Mr. Viniar","Correct. That was significant, and this offset----"
"Senator Levin","But this, at least for that big chunk, the synthetics, showed you net short, is that correct, all year long?"
"Mr. Viniar","In synthetics."
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Levin","OK. And overall, were you short most of the year, which is what you told the SEC, I believe, did you not?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, and it is consistent with what I told you. Overall, across the year, our portfolio was short----"
"Senator Levin","And did you----"
"Mr. Viniar","And that is why we were profitable. But it just was not very large."
"Senator Levin","Well, large is in the eyes of the beholder."
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Levin","Billions seem large to a lot of folks who have lost their homes. Take a look, if you would, at Exhibit 22.\1\ This is a presentation to the Board of Directors, March 26, 2007. OK? Have you got it?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 22, which appears in the Appendix on page 276. "
"Mr. Viniar","I do."
"Senator Levin","OK. Take a look at the ``Time Line of Major Events.'' If you look at the subprime sector----"
"Mr. Viniar","Are you on page 4, sir?"
"Senator Levin","Page 8."
"Mr. Viniar","I am sorry. Got it."
"Senator Levin","The first and second quarter of 2006, the long position grows. So you are going long in 2006. Third and fourth quarter, you scale back purchase of loans. You reduce your CDO activity. ``First quarter, Goldman Sachs reverses''-- reverses, sounds directional to me--``long market position through purchases of single name CDSs and reductions of ABX.'' Right? Am I reading that correctly?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","That you reversed your long market position?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","All right. That is what you told the Board."
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Levin","Then, keep reading there, you ``effectively halt new purchases of sub-prime loan pools through conservative bids.'' In other words, you made bids that were so low that you weren't going to be able to buy them. Your warehouse lending business reduced. That is now the direction that you took, according to what you told the Board. You reversed your long market position, pretty directional."
"Mr. Viniar","I would say, sir, all consistent with what I said, meant to reduce our risk and----"
"Senator Levin","I know you are going to talk about reducing risk. You made billions of dollars going short, not net. You made billions of dollars going short, so you can talk about that as reducing risk. I talk about that as making a jell of a lot of money. But you can characterize it the way you want."
"Mr. Viniar","But we only had the short because we had the long. If we didn't have the long, we never would have put on the short."
"Senator Levin","You blew right by zero."
"Mr. Viniar","Not materially so."
"Senator Levin","Materially."
"Mr. Viniar","If you look across----"
"Senator Levin","Billions."
"Mr. Viniar","If you look across all of--just 2007, leaving 2008 aside, residential mortgages, the net revenues were less than $500 million."
"Senator Levin","So you were able to overcome the long losses and still make a half-a-billion dollars, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","That is correct."
"Senator Levin","All right. Now, did you hear what Mr. Birnbaum said about what happened in December 2006? Were you here when he testified?"
"Mr. Viniar","I listened to it, but I am not sure what you are referring to."
"Senator Levin","OK. .\1\ ``revailing opinion within the department was that we should just `get close to home' and pare down our long.'' That is your argument about reducing risk as the motivator. Then he lays out here in his own words why he thought that you should go way beyond that, and here is what he said. ``I concluded that we should not only get flat,'' get your risk down to home, get it to zero, ``but get VERY short.'' He then began sharing that idea with a whole lot of folks, and then he said, ``e all agreed the plan made sense.'' The plan he is talking about is to go, as he puts it, ``VERY short,'' not just flat, but ``VERY short.''  \1\ See Exhibit No. 55c, which appears in the Appendix on page 447.  ``e implemented the plan by hitting on almost every single named CDO protection and buying opportunity in a 2-month period. Much of the plan began working by February as the market dropped 25 points and our very profitable year was underway.'' Do you disagree that plan was to go very short?"
"Mr. Viniar","That might have been his plan, but that was not the firm's plan."
"Senator Levin","Well, but he also said that the plan was accepted, did he not?"
"Mr. Viniar","That might have been his plan within the SPG desk. I actually don't know, other than what I have read, because I would look at the firm overall and the firm overall had what I would call, with hindsight, a small net short."
"Senator Levin","An amazing performance with a market that went under in mortgages. You were able, because of a huge short position that you took, to overcome what was a previously long position, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","We were able to get it very close--as close to flat as we could."
"Senator Levin","And as a matter of fact--well, these shorts were way above flat. The only way you got to that kind of a profit was by going way above flat. Look, this is his own words. It says that the plan was accepted."
"Mr. Viniar","That was his plan----"
"Senator Levin","I understand----"
"Mr. Viniar","On the SPG desk----"
"Senator Levin","You were just unaware that the department was doing that."
"Mr. Viniar","I would not have looked at what one part of the mortgage business. I would have looked at what the mortgage business overall was doing."
"Senator Levin","OK. And it was profitable, despite the mortgage business going south?"
"Mr. Viniar","It was. As I said----"
"Senator Levin","You guys were profitable, and you were profitable because you had invested heavily in shorts. And let me just read something else that he said. He said that he was ``able to identify key market dislocations that led to tremendous profits.'' And you are just saying, that was in his department."
"Mr. Viniar","I think he was just referring to his department, not to the firm or the Mortgage Department overall."
"Senator Levin","In terms of direction, here is what you told your Board of Directors in September 2007. You said that----"
"Mr. Viniar","Sir, can you point me to where you are reading so I can read with you?"
"Senator Levin","Yes. Exhibit 41.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 41, which appears in the Appendix on page 327. "
"Mr. Viniar","Thank you. I think I see it."
"Senator Levin","``usiness has taken proactive steps to position the firm strategically in the ensuing mortgage credit and liquidity crisis,'' and this is all the things you did."
"Mr. Viniar","Can you just give me a page, please?"
"Senator Levin","Yes, page 4."
"Mr. Viniar","Thank you. OK. I have it."
"Senator Levin","You ``shorted synthetics.'' You ``reduced loan and security purchases.'' You ``shorted CDOs and RMBS.'' You ``increased long correlation position,'' which is also a shorting operation. And you ``reduced the long inventory.'' That is what you did in quarter two and quarter three of 2007. That was a strategic positioning for the firm, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Am I reading that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","You are."
"Senator Levin","And if you look at page 5, the year to date, this is the mortgage business, you are still losing money on your longs, much of which came from your earlier inventory. You made a little money on real estate loans. You made money on non-mortgage asset backed securities. And then look at your structured products trading, $955 million. So altogether, your gross revenue is a billion dollars, and that billion dollars was because you made $955 million, is that not correct, basically in your structured products trading. Is that fair?"
"Mr. Viniar","Completely accurate."
"Senator Levin","OK. And this was a strategic decision which you told the Board about----"
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Levin","In March, and you also then told the SEC."
"Mr. Viniar","Again, what I have told you consistently, and I will not--I won't deny, we were short over most of 2007. On a net basis, it was not that large, which is why about 1 percent of the firm's revenue came from residential mortgages."
"Senator Levin","Goldman did have, then, a big short, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","Offsetting a big long, yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","And what was the amount of the short, do you know?"
"Mr. Viniar","It is very hard to give a number."
"Senator Levin","About. Was it over $3 billion?"
"Mr. Viniar","I wouldn't even know how to quantify it, because we had so many different securities----"
"Senator Levin","Have you tried to quantify it?"
"Mr. Viniar","No, I have not."
"Senator Levin","You won't estimate that it was even over $3 billion, which that one department produced?"
"Mr. Viniar","Are you talking about revenues?"
"Senator Levin","Yes. Short revenues."
"Mr. Viniar","Yes. The short revenues, and I would have to find the page, but I know the page you were looking at before, the revenues from the short were over $3 billion."
"Senator Levin","All right."
"Mr. Viniar","And they offset revenue losses----"
"Senator Levin","I know."
"Mr. Viniar","From long that were nearly as big."
"Senator Levin","But it was the big short which kept you in the black that year, wasn't it?"
"Mr. Viniar","It was the big short offsetting the big long which helped very much us get through that crisis."
"Senator Levin","Well, if it weren't for the big short, you would have been deeply in the red that year, wouldn't you?"
"Mr. Viniar","If we had not sold any of the long positions, yes, that would have been true."
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","That is why we put it on, to try to offset the long positions."
"Senator Levin","Your Exhibit 26,\1\ where you said the big short position of yours, in your own words--this is your words--``Tells you what might be happening to people who don't have the big short.'' Is that right? Did you say that?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 26, which appears in the Appendix on page 306. "
"Mr. Viniar","Those--that is my email."
"Senator Levin","And did you mean that?"
"Mr. Viniar","I meant what I meant, and this is a little bit of a response to a question I heard Dr. Coburn ask before about why we always tell people to be careful with emails, because I didn't give the full thought, which is it tells you what might happen to people who have the big short--who don't have the big short when they do have a big long."
"Senator Levin","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","This came, I believe, shortly after people had announced their second quarter results. Quite a number of people had disclosed how big their long inventory positions were, and without basically balancing those positions, there would be significant losses, which is what proved to happen across the industry."
"Senator Levin","All right. So the big short saved your rear end?"
"Mr. Viniar","The offsetting----"
"Senator Levin","As we put it in the vernacular, the big short allowed you to have a year in the black, is that----"
"Mr. Viniar","What I would say is the----"
"Senator Levin","We know what you would say, but without that big short, you would not have been in the black that year. You would be with a whole bunch of other firms that did not go short the way you did, is that accurate?"
"Mr. Viniar","Without managing our risk appropriately to largely reduce our risk in the mortgage business, we would certainly have had lower revenues than we had."
"Senator Levin","Was your risk bias to be short?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, it was."
"Senator Levin","My time is up. Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","Just to be clear, I have a little difference with the Chairman on the idea of shorts. What would happen to the financial markets if there was not the ability to go short against a long position?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think there would be significantly less credit in the market because people would not want to take exposures to various companies, be it in mortgages, be it in credit products, be it in equities. People would have no ability to manage their risk, and so I think rather than reducing risk through offsetting longs with shorts, you just wouldn't have the longs, and so there would be much less credit provided."
"Senator Coburn","And if a shareholder looked at Goldman and said, you all had the ability to go short, you had the research that said you should go short, and that you didn't go short, could they hold you liable? In other words, could somebody have a basis for a suit against Goldman if you, through your research and through managing your risk, you passed up an opportunity to improve the shareholder value of Goldman?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think it is, from a risk management point of view, we actually don't tell desks ever to go short or go long, but I think our shareholders could be quite disappointed in us if we didn't use the right tools to manage our risk appropriately, and when we thought our risk was too big, to not reduce that risk, either by selling it outright or by putting on offsetting short positions."
"Senator Coburn","Senator Levin asked you a question I was going to go to and you answered, yes, that you had risk bias that was short during 2007. Explain to the Subcommittee, if you would, the difference between your--and I am talking Goldman's definition of market making and proprietary trading, because that is what the SEC suit is about. That is what a lot of our inquiries are about. It is not about going short. Short is a legitimate market function."
"Mr. Viniar","Right."
"Senator Coburn","But explain to us the difference between those two as you see it and as you lead this firm."
"Mr. Viniar","OK. Let me try----"
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Viniar","And it is a little bit complicated, so stop me if you want me to go in a different direction. But market making is what the great majority of what we do in our trading business is. That is, we buy things from or sell things to our customers. In doing that, we will accumulate inventories, long inventory and short inventory, and we might have a bias of what we keep and how long we keep it, which might tend to make us longer or shorter at any time. But most of those transactions start and end with our clients. Now, it might be hard to track that inventory, so we might buy something from someone and then distribute part of it, but then buy something else that offsets it and buy something else that goes into the book, and a year later, we might still have it. And so someone might argue and say--you still have it a year later or 6 months later, so it sounds like proprietary trading, but it is not. It starts with a customer. I distinguish that from what I would call a purely walled- off proprietary business that generally has research coverage from other Wall Street firms and really does not deal with customers, but just goes long things, short things, offsetting positions, sometimes capital structure, purely for the account of the firm, without dealing with our clients."
"Senator Coburn","And that is where Mr. Birnbaum worked. He worked in strictly proprietary trading?"
"Mr. Viniar","No. He worked more in a market-making business----"
"Senator Coburn","That is right----"
"Mr. Viniar","He was buying and selling things."
"Senator Coburn","That is exactly the question that I was asking him. Did you hear his testimony?"
"Mr. Viniar","I heard most of it."
"Senator Coburn","Does it concern you at all that his position is that, in his own self-evaluation, which Senator Levin referred to, that he was taking positions and touting himself that he was utilizing the strengths of their analysis to take positions to enhance your return on equity?"
"Mr. Viniar","It is a little hard for me to comment on what he meant in his self-evaluation, but what I would view his role as is market making. So he would be buying and selling things. But he then did have discretion within the overall limits of the firm, again, of what he kept, how long he kept it, would he buy more than he sold, would he tend to keep the long risk and sell the short risk or vice-versa. So it was within a market making context, but he had a limit as to--we had an overall firm limit as to where we would go."
"Senator Coburn","Well, let me ask you this, if you would. Does it make sense to you somebody would tout a philosophy that says, I am going to take advantage of the knowledge that we as a firm have and make more money for the firm, yet ignore the information in terms of the Mortgage Department, what they were seeing and how you were changing positions? Is that believable to you?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't know what Mr. Birnbaum did know, didn't know, or why he said what he said."
"Senator Coburn","OK. All right. In what year did you all receive your payment from AIG? What fiscal year? The settlement on AIG, when we bailed them out. What fiscal year did you receive----"
"Mr. Viniar","Are you talking about the Maiden Lane transaction? I believe that was 2008."
"Senator Coburn","And that was $11 billion?"
"Mr. Viniar","Well, there are several. I am just not sure which one you are talking about."
"Senator Coburn","Well, in total, though, you are saying it is fiscal year 2008, you received $11 billion----"
"Mr. Viniar","The number that is, if this is what you are referring to----"
"Senator Coburn","You give me the number. I don't care what-- "
"Mr. Viniar","Generally talked about is $12.9 billion----"
"Senator Coburn","OK."
"Mr. Viniar","The number that he talked about in----"
"Senator Coburn","OK, $12.9 billion. I was trained as an accountant first, before I ever went to medical school, so you will have to pardon it."
"Mr. Viniar","Me, too."
"Senator Coburn","All right. That $12.9 billion really represents revenue from 2006, doesn't it, and 2007? In other words, when did AIG go belly-up?"
"Mr. Viniar","Can I describe to you the pieces of the $12.9 billion?"
"Senator Coburn","Well, you can, and I will give you that time, but what I am trying to get to is an accurate representation of what the positions that you bought, the insurance that you bought--that is really what AIG sold you, correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","That was some of that $12.9 billion----"
"Senator Coburn","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","But not all of it."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Well, whatever portion it was, in the year that it should have been paid, it wasn't. It was paid later. So that would have enhanced your revenues by a certain number of billions of dollars, is that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","No."
"Senator Coburn","You didn't recognize that payoff of those insurance products to you as revenue when you got it from AIG?"
"Mr. Viniar","No, we did not, because that position is marked to market. They were just basically paying us the money they owed us. But because we mark all of our positions to market, that revenue had come in already, and just so you know, those positions, again, were largely offsetting positions we had sold on the other side."
"Senator Coburn","Well, I am not disputing. I have no problem with shorting. I have no problem with buying insurance, or buying puts, or selling calls. I have no problem with that. What I am trying to do is match revenues with expenses, and the point is this was an insurance product that you had marked down the real product, and when you got paid, you had to show that as either an offset to that revenue loss in what you were buying insurance for or you were showing income."
"Mr. Viniar","There was very little revenue upon the payment because all of that had gone through our books already, all of the markdowns and markups on both sides."
"Senator Coburn","That is right."
"Mr. Viniar","There was very little----"
"Senator Coburn","Well, but if it wasn't collectable and AIG was bankrupt, there had to be a period in time when you had a material impact on your business that you had to give notice of, isn't that correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","We had collateral for almost all of what they owed us, and what we didn't have collateral for, we had bought CDS protection for. So although it obviously would have been a very bad thing for the financial markets, for our direct exposure to AIG at the time, we had either collateral or CDS protection, which again was collateralized, for virtually the entire exposure we had."
"Senator Coburn","So you double-insured, basically?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, we did."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And I told you I would give you an opportunity to explain the $12.9 brillion."
"Mr. Viniar","If you want me to."
"Senator Coburn","Yes, I do."
"Mr. Viniar","There were three pieces to the $12.9 billion. The first and simplest to understand is what is called securities lending. Basically, they had a portfolio of highly liquid treasuries and agencies that we had financed. So they had, I believe, the number was $4.8 billion of our cash and we had $4.8 billion of their treasuries and agencies. They gave us the $4.8 billion of cash, but we gave them back the $4.8 billion of securities. So if they had not, we would have just sold them into the market because they were highly liquid, as I said, mostly treasuries and agencies. There was $2.5 billion which was over the course of from mid-September, when the government put the money into AIG, until December, additional collateral that they owed us as markets continued to decline. So that was not a one-time payment. That came in over time. And the last roughly $5.6 billion was in settlement of Maiden Lane, and those were where they wanted to basically tear up the cash transactions. So they gave us $5.6 billion. We took most of that. We added to that the collateral they had already given us, took most of it, gave it to the counterparty on the other side, who added to it the collateral we had given them. They gave us back the bonds and we gave the bonds back to AIG."
"Senator Coburn","Exhibit 5,\1\ if you would turn to that, please, this is an email from Mr. Birnbaum to Mr. Lehman.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 5, which appears in the Appendix on page 253. "
"Mr. Viniar","Got it."
"Senator Coburn","In this email, the implication is that Mr. Birnbaum felt that we should keep these positions for ourselves. Do you have any heartburn with the fact that when those kind of statements are said, that it undercuts your position on proprietary trading and mortgage-related assets?"
"Mr. Viniar","Honestly, I don't know what he was referring to here. This is the first time I am seeing this."
"Senator Coburn","Well, let me describe a scenario for you, and we will make it a matter of fiction rather than fact."
"Mr. Viniar","OK."
"Senator Coburn","I work for you and I see a good deal, and rather than sell it to our loyal customers, I am going to keep it for us."
"Mr. Viniar","As a market maker, his responsibility is to buy and sell things, buy things from customers, sell things to them. As I said, that doesn't mean we won't keep things for some period of time and then sell them out, but largely what we want to do is distribute risk. We keep track of things. We will call aged item inventory to make sure we don't keep it too long. So if he kept it for some period of time, would it trouble me? Not necessarily. If he kept it for a very long period of time, would it trouble me? Yes, it would, because our job is to make markets, not to hold onto the inventory."
"Senator Coburn","Your job also is to keep customers, isn't it?"
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Coburn","And if you don't have customers with which to make markets for, you are not going to do that----"
"Mr. Viniar","That is correct."
"Senator Coburn","And that is why I was going that direction on that."
"Mr. Viniar","That is correct."
"Senator Coburn","You heard the testimony of Mr. Sparks and other managers that urged the sales force to sell Goldman's long positions, and it comes back to the question I raised in my opening statement, about the ethics of what we are doing here. Were they selling those long positions for the benefit of the customer or for the benefit of Goldman? In other words, you had a position. Your plan was to get back to zero."
"Mr. Viniar","As close as possible."
"Senator Coburn","Yes, as close as you could, and that is prudent. How do you control that from an ethical and character standpoint? How do you define the line for the people that are selling these products for you, whether it is your inventory or something you want to lessen? How do you weight off the balance, the benefit for Goldman versus the detriment for who is buying it?"
"Mr. Viniar","Really, in a way, the way you do that is through pricing, and so we may or may not like the security. Someone else might like it more, and they certainly might like it at a certain price. And so it is not a view of good or bad. It is really a view of, do you think the buyer, do they think that it will go up----"
"Senator Coburn","What is the value and what do I think the chance----"
"Mr. Viniar","What is the value? And then if we have bought something and we still have it and we want to sell it and we just think our risk is too big, we might have to cut the price and sell it at 80 cents on the dollar and the other purchaser may not think it is a great security, but they may think it is worth more than 80 cents. They may think it is worth 83 cents, which is still not 100 percent, but it is a price at which they want to buy it."
"Senator Coburn","Could you answer this question for me, and maybe you can't, but I would like for you to try because it concerns a lot of us. How is it that Goldman got 100 percent payback on this collateral dispute with AIG?"
"Mr. Viniar","All I can say is it was what they owed us."
"Senator Coburn","Well, but typically--we didn't pay off the bond holders at GM. So how is it that Goldman got 100 percent back of what was owed from AIG when everybody else didn't?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think everybody did from AIG."
"Senator Coburn","Well, how is it that you all negotiated that?"
"Mr. Viniar","I believe on the Maiden Lane transaction, we were sent the term sheet, which had the transaction that AIG wanted to do, which was to basically unwind those transactions at par, and we agreed to do that."
"Senator Coburn","So there wasn't a negotiation between the Treasury and Goldman on the AIG collateral?"
"Mr. Viniar","There was not."
"Senator Coburn","OK. So they made an offer and you accepted it?"
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Thank you. I am through, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Senator Kaufman."
"Senator Kaufman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Viniar, let me just ask you a philosophical question. I am sitting here looking at the segment operating results and I see that in 2009----"
"Mr. Viniar","Senator, can you tell me where you are looking so I can look with you?"
"Senator Kaufman","I don't think you need it. Because it is not----"
"Mr. Viniar","Sure."
"Senator Kaufman","I am not going to get into the details. I am just asking the questions. I mean, does it concern you? I mean, here is Goldman Sachs, known to be a great investment banker, the greatest, and I look at November 2007, November 2008, December 2008, and I see earnings of about $2 billion each one of those years. I look down at the trading and principal investments, and $13 billion in earning in 2007. You lost $3 billion in 2008. And you have made $17 billion in 2009. Does it concern you that more and more of your business is over in trading and less and less is in investment banking?"
"Mr. Viniar","No, I wouldn't say it concerns me. I would say, first of all, the segment revenues don't reflect the value of our investment banking business because----"
"Senator Kaufman","Can you explain that?"
"Mr. Viniar","Sure. Our trading and principal investing business is very much of a customer facing business. Part of that, we do with our customers based on a relationship which has developed over many years of giving them advice, and just because a transaction's revenues end up from a trade of some kind, you are making a market, doesn't mean that a good part of that value isn't from the investment banking relationship we have had for a number of years. So I think it understates their value. The second thing I would say is the trading or principal investing business, while it is growing, is growing largely because of the strength of our customer franchise, the same type of customer relationships----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, I understand that part. I have got it. But let me put it this way. Should it concern the people on this side of the dais that one of the major engines that has driven this country for so many years is the investment banking, the ability to have IPOs, the ability to fund major corporate enterprises, and the fact that now one of, if not the biggest investment banker in America is now making money trading as opposed to doing investment banking?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't think it should concern you, because again, it is based on, largely on making markets for our clients and helping the capital markets operate, and I think that is actually a good thing for the growth of the country."
"Senator Kaufman","To follow up on Chairman Levin's question, if you wanted to hedge your long positions, why didn't you just sell the securities and cancel or sell the CDs?"
"Mr. Viniar","That is a very good question, and in some cases we did, and the best way to hedge your risk is always to sell the position outright."
"Senator Kaufman","I mean, that seems to me--I agree with"
"Senator Coburn","Selling short is good and all the other things, and I have done it, but what people do to hedge risk is you reach a point where you decide that your long position is risky----"
"Mr. Viniar","Right."
"Senator Kaufman","And, as someone once said, smarter than me, the hardest thing is not the decision to buy, it is the decision to sell."
"Mr. Viniar","No question."
"Senator Kaufman","So most people--you get into a risky position, you have a risk meeting, you say, I am in--I mean, all of us do this in our own personal investing. You say, I have got invested in Stock A, B, and C. I don't like the new earnings on it. I sell it."
"Mr. Viniar","And it is a risk-reward judgment question at the time. You look at what price you could sell that position. You make an assessment of that versus what it would cost you to put on an offsetting position, and understanding that putting on an offsetting position is never an exact hedge."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","And you do have additional risk."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","And you make the assessment of--is the price where you would have to sell that security versus the price you pay to put on the offsetting? If it is a lower price, is it enough lower that it is still worth it or not. And you make that judgment at the time. And markets at the time, if you remember, for the securities that were long, were quite illiquid, and so we made judgments that in some cases we did sell, and I think you see that over the year, we did sell some. But in some cases, we thought it was more prudent to put it on offsetting positions."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But illiquid really, in this case, means you didn't like the prices that things were being sold for. It is not that you couldn't go into a market. I mean, illiquid to me means I go into the market and nobody is--like happened on certain days, bad dice, in our history, we just couldn't sell it at any price. You are basically saying, I didn't want to sell it because the price was so low----"
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","Correct, which means----"
"Senator Kaufman","And I have got that. I am just trying to figure out, but you mark to market, right?"
"Mr. Viniar","Correct. So we would have marked it down, but again, that is just an assessment which sometimes proves to be right and sometimes proves to be wrong, of what the value of holding that security would be----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","In the future, where we think it was going to go, versus what the price would be of buying an offsetting security."
"Senator Kaufman","But you can understand why some people would be concerned. At the same time that a number of people in your business, in Goldman Sachs, were saying, this market is going south, which I think was--I happen to be one of those not Monday morning quarterbacking, but just at the time, the way I felt, and I am not--but just looking at where the housing market was in terms of where it had been historically, looking at the rental market and seeing the rental market wasn't growing, classic sign of a bubble, that--so there was incentive, kind of. I know you keep--there is an incentive here to go short. I mean, based on--especially, you get to 2007. Let me put it this way. I personally have a hard time believing that folks as smart as you guys didn't see the housing market was having a bubble and that the idea of going short was a good decision based on prudent managers looking at a market that was clearly falling apart."
"Mr. Viniar","What I would say, again, as I have said repeatedly, is over the course of 2007, we were, for the most part, somewhat short----"
"Senator Kaufman","Yes."
"Mr. Viniar","And that was a decision. We wanted to be more on the short side than the long side."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","But it was not large, and we didn't know where the market was going----"
"Senator Kaufman","No one ever knows where the market is going. I am just saying, at that particular point in time----"
"Mr. Viniar","The other thing to remember back to 2007, it is hard to remember back then, but there was a very strong point of view, which didn't turn out to be correct, but it was very strong, that the decline was isolated to the subprime mortgage market. Again, that turned out not to be correct and different people had different views, but that was a fairly commonly held view through much of 2007, that the decline was just subprime mortgages. The rest of the mortgage market actually had not declined very much. It did later in the year. And if you remember, the equity markets actually peaked in October 2007."
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. No, I agree with that."
"Mr. Viniar","For most of that year, there was a lot of bullishness still in the market----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","Other than the subprime mortgage market."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But you could have sold the long, dealt with it that way, without going short. And the reason I think we all keep coming back to this is because it really is hard for me to see--I mean, there is a clear conflict of interest, right, when you have a client out there in a position that you put him in and you are at the same time selling that position short. I am not saying it is bad. I am just saying it is a conflict of interest, isn't it?"
"Mr. Viniar","Not necessarily."
"Senator Kaufman","No, I am not saying necessarily. I am just saying, in general, if you are selling a client something long, you are saying to the client--it is still time to buy RMBSs and we are selling them to you. And at the same time, you are going short. I think that just causes concern. I am not saying it is bad. I am not saying it is illegal. I am not saying anything else. I am just saying it just seems to me that it is a tough conflict of interest that you probably have to deal with every day, and that is----"
"Mr. Viniar","I actually don't view it as a conflict because we change--when we sell someone a security, their investment horizon is generally a fairly long time."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","We make decisions on a bias on where we want our risk to be, that could be a very short-term decision. It could change in the next day."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","And so what we do when we sell someone a security is we make sure we fully disclose to them what they are buying, what the risks are, and then they make their investment decisions over whatever time----"
"Senator Kaufman","But you were selling these mortgage-backed securities during this whole period. I am not talking about just buy and hold. I am talking about the day after you sold something short, you then were selling something long."
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure I----"
"Senator Kaufman","I mean, to clients, not for your own account."
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure I know, individual securities, what we bought, what we sold."
"Senator Kaufman","So you just stopped selling these mortgage-backed securities when you started to go short?"
"Mr. Viniar","No. We were still selling things, but again, as I said to Dr. Coburn, that just depends on the prices you sell it----"
"Senator Kaufman","I have got it----"
"Mr. Viniar","And if somebody thinks it is a good investment."
"Senator Kaufman","I am not saying there is anything wrong. I am just saying, just to me, if I am selling things short and the same day or the next day I am selling a client a long, that just seems to me there is a conflict in there. Whether it is resolved or not, or how it is resolved, but it just seems to me that is a tough call in terms of what is your--which we got into in the earlier panel. What is my responsibility to my client? And I know you used--and everyone does--this kind of, well, they are all big boys and they all are investing long and they know what they are doing. But that, to me, doesn't--and while I think that is true in many cases, that still doesn't rule out the fact that you are doing one thing for yourself at the same time you are doing something to one of your clients."
"Mr. Viniar","I don't view it that way----"
"Senator Kaufman","OK."
"Mr. Viniar","Because our positions change quite often."
"Senator Kaufman","We can just agree to disagree."
"Mr. Viniar","OK."
"Senator Kaufman","Have you heard about the Lehman Brothers use of so-called Repo 105s?"
"Mr. Viniar","I have heard about it, yes. I have read about it."
"Senator Kaufman","And what is your understanding of these transactions?"
"Mr. Viniar","Only from what I read in the newspaper----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","That they treated things as sells that were going to come back on the balance sheet. I don't know the details----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right. And why would they be doing that?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't----"
"Senator Kaufman","You don't know. OK. I think the best way to explain it, there was Lehman structures repo agreements to mask its true net leverage ratio through an accounting device known as Repo 105s, whereby it raised cash and repo transactions by selling assets that were 105 percent or more of the cash received, allowing it to treat them as a sale rather than financing. As explained by the New York Times Deal Book, that meant there were a few days, and by the fourth quarter of 2007, that meant end-of-the-quarter, Lehman could shuffle off tens of billions of dollars in assets to appear more financially healthy than it really was. What do you think about that? Not from Lehman Brothers, what do you think about the concept as reported by Deal Book?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think as far as Lehman Brothers, it is a better question for them----"
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Suppose there was a firm out there, and we are not talking about Lehman Brothers--or let me put it this way. Would Goldman Sachs ever do something like this?"
"Mr. Viniar","No. We did none of those transactions."
"Senator Kaufman","So you can say here that Goldman Sachs never engaged in a transaction near a quarter's end to improve its balance sheet?"
"Mr. Viniar","We never engaged in Repo 105 transactions."
"Senator Kaufman","No. I am asking----"
"Mr. Viniar","Anything we did near quarter end, if we took something off our balance sheet, it was because we sold it."
"Senator Kaufman","But I am just saying, you never--so, therefore, you never engaged in a transaction near the quarter's end to improve its balance sheet for investor reporting purposes?"
"Mr. Viniar","We would do transactions at quarter end where we would sell things."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","Then we had risk. We couldn't buy them back. We would do other transactions in other quarters where we would buy things."
"Senator Kaufman","And do you know how many transactions that you did at the end of the quarter that at the beginning of the next quarter you bought them back again or sold them again?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am sure we had transactions that we sold and bought back and then sold again."
"Senator Kaufman","No, but I mean----"
"Mr. Viniar","I am sure we had both."
"Senator Kaufman","In order to make the quarterly report----"
"Mr. Viniar","Everything was disclosed. Everything we did, we disclosed. End of quarter, we disclosed quarterly average. We disclosed all of those numbers. So anyone can see what we have at any point in time."
"Senator Kaufman","So essentially you never moved things on or off the balance sheet----"
"Mr. Viniar","In order to dress up our balance sheet? No."
"Senator Kaufman","OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator Kaufman. Senator Ensign."
"Senator Ensign","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just how well do you understand all of the various financial instruments that Goldman Sachs was offering, the CDOs, CDSs, all of those things?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am far from an expert in all of the individual transactions."
"Senator Ensign","But you understand basically how they work?"
"Mr. Viniar","At the highest levels. You had the experts here this morning."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Do you feel at all that--we asked this question of the panel this morning--whether Goldman Sachs was partially responsible, largely responsible, or had no responsibility in the financial collapse of the United States?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think Goldman Sachs is a major player in the world financial markets. The financial markets, I believe, got over-levered. I think lending standards declined."
"Senator Ensign","Do you feel that Goldman Sachs has any responsibility, not blame----"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes, I----"
"Senator Ensign","I am talking about blame in the financial collapse of the United States."
"Mr. Viniar","I believe that we share responsibility because we are a major player in those markets and we participated in those----"
"Senator Ensign","I appreciate you taking the responsibility, because this morning's panel would not."
"Mr. Viniar","No, I believe----"
"Senator Ensign","I want to follow along the lines of questioning I asked this morning. And this gets to the rating agencies and what they were doing. Do you understanding the modeling that they were taking these, not necessarily exact modeling, but do you understand that they were taking, for instance, these BBB tranches, repackaging, and then re-rating them as AAAs?"
"Mr. Viniar","No. I know nothing about----"
"Senator Ensign","Are you aware of anybody at Goldman Sachs who was talking? Were you aware of your folks talking to the credit rating agencies to try to convince them and basically kind of sell them, here is why it shouldn't be a BBB, here is why it should be a AAA?"
"Mr. Viniar","I know that the transactions were rated. I wouldn't know who had those conversations, what they said. My only conversation with the rating agencies concerned the ratings of Goldman Sachs itself."
"Senator Ensign","And so you had no knowledge of anybody at Goldman Sachs doing that type of, basically, lobbying with the credit rating agencies?"
"Mr. Viniar","I did not."
"Senator Ensign","Are you familiar with who Steve Eisman is?"
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Ensign","Or have you ever perused through the book, ``The Big Short,'' by Michael Lewis?"
"Mr. Viniar","I have not."
"Senator Ensign","Are you familiar with it?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am familiar with it----"
"Senator Ensign","I just want to----"
"Mr. Viniar","I have not read any of it."
"Senator Ensign","Because I think this goes to one of the-- when you said you had responsibility, I am glad you said that Goldman Sachs actually does have some responsibility. This is kind of an explanation of some of what was happening in the financial markets. According to Steve Eisman, Goldman Sachs and Deutsche Bank, on the fate of the BBB tranche of subprime mortgage-backed bonds without fully understanding why those firms were so eager to accept them. He didn't know at the time. Later, he figured, at least he thinks he figured it out. The credit default swaps filtered through the CDOs were used to replicate bonds backed by actual home loans. ``There weren't enough Americans,'' and I am quoting here, so excuse the language, ``there weren't enough Americans with shi**y credit ratings taking out loans to satisfy investors' appetite for the end product. Wall Street needed his bets in order to synthesize more of them. `They weren't satisfied getting lots of unqualified borrowers to borrow money to buy a house they couldn't afford,' said Eisman. They were creating them out of whole cloth, 100 times over. That is why the losses in the financial system are so much greater than the subprime loans.'' The premise that, or at least what his analysis was of the reason that it became--even though the subprime market itself was bad, the collapse of that market wouldn't have been nearly as bad for the entire rest of the economy if it wasn't for a lot of the synthetic instruments that were created by firms like Goldman Sachs and others. Would you agree with that statement?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't know what he meant or anything, but----"
"Senator Ensign","The statement that I made, would you agree with that statement?"
"Mr. Viniar","Just the math is, anytime you have something that declines in value that is levered, it adds to more losses. So that would be the case for anything that declines in value if it has leverage to it."
"Senator Ensign","We are dealing with financial regulatory reform right now, and obviously it is a hot political debate up here. From the inside, what would you do as far as the changes in regulation, not that addresses out there in Main Street, but just address Wall Street. What would some of your big recommendations be to the U.S. Congress?"
"Mr. Viniar","Well, some of the things, and I am an internal guy. I mean, I worried about Goldman Sachs and its finances, and I----"
"Senator Ensign","But at the same time, you said you took responsibility, Goldman Sachs."
"Mr. Viniar","Absolutely."
"Senator Ensign","You don't want to be part of the next financial collapse."
"Mr. Viniar","Correct."
"Senator Ensign","Being an insider, help us with at least your advice. We don't have to take it, but we can at least evaluate it, what we are doing right now. Because the one thing I do know is the Congress doesn't have enough expertise to draft this law right now."
"Mr. Viniar","What I would say is that a couple of places that I think are important to focus on, I think that if you look around financial institutions, the thing that tends to cause more problems than anything are liquidity problems within the institutions, and I think more stringent liquidity requirements for financial institutions would be important. And the second thing, I think it is pretty clear that we need higher capital charges for less-liquid assets, because I think holding less-liquid assets was one of the things that got firms in trouble. They didn't have enough capital against them. So those would be two things that I would tell you should be part of any regulation."
"Senator Ensign","What about the relationship between the credit rating agencies and those of you on Wall Street as far as how cozy it seems to have been, because you guys pay their bills and----"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't have a view on that."
"Senator Ensign","OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator Ensign. Mr. Broderick, the Subcommittee staff prepared a chart on VaR.\1\ . And between December 2006 and 2007, the VaR, the measure of risk, was almost continuously over the Mortgage Department's permanent limit. Do you remember that?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 164, which appears in the Appendix on page  "
"Mr. Broderick","Yes, I do."
"Senator Levin","And it peaks at or near 100 VaR, above the limit. Is that something that you approved?"
"Mr. Broderick","It is something that the firm-wide risk committee approved on an exception basis, on an ongoing basis, yes."
"Senator Levin","Well, all year, they were over your permanent limit. They were hugely over it. At one point, they had the majority of your risk tied up just in that one department, did they not? Were they at 56 percent of your VaR at one point?"
"Mr. Broderick","I would have to look at the figures precisely, but----"
"Senator Levin","Well, approximately. Were they at a huge percentage of your total firm VaR at one point?"
"Mr. Broderick","They were a large percent, but Mr. Chairman, let me just make one point, which is that the numbers may well not include the effect diversification, which is to say when you add the individual product by product areas, you get a number that is in excess of the total firm-wide VaR because firm-wide VaR gives effect to diversification. So that would tend to understate the--or, rather, overstate the impact of mortgage VaR specifically. But the general point you are making is entirely right, which is this was a large percent of the firm's VaR, certainly much larger than it had been historically."
"Senator Levin","And the short positions that they were taking during that year were the major contribution to that, is that correct?"
"Mr. Broderick","To the mortgage VaR, yes."
"Senator Levin","To the high mortgage VaR, is that what you said?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes, that is correct."
"Senator Levin","The Mortgage Department's contribution to that firm-wide VaR is shown over here. Take a look at Exhibit 35,\1\ if you would.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 35, which appears in the Appendix on page 320. "
"Mr. Broderick","OK."
"Senator Levin","Do you see it?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes."
"Senator Levin","OK. The percentage of contribution to the firm-wide VaR was shown in that exhibit at 53.8 percent for mortgage structured products, is that correct?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes. I believe that is the--I am not positive about this, but I think this relates to the entire mortgage group at the time this report was presented."
"Senator Levin","Well, this report was a Goldman report, right?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes."
"Senator Levin","It says, mortgage structured products, 53.8 percent of the firm-wide VaR."
"Mr. Broderick","Right."
"Senator Levin","And that, you agreed already, was a result of their significant short position, is that correct?"
"Mr. Broderick","The mortgage VaR was being driven primarily by the short positions at this time, yes."
"Senator Levin","All right. Now, if you look at Exhibit 48,\2\ this is a presentation which I believe you gave to the Goldman Tax Department in October 2007. Does that look familiar to you?  \2\ See Exhibit No. 48, which appears in the Appendix on page 376. "
"Mr. Broderick","Yes, it does."
"Senator Levin","OK. Take a look at page 2, the fourth full paragraph. I am going to read it to you. ``So what happened to us? A quick word on our own market and credit risk performance in this regard. In market risk - you saw in our 2nd and 3rd qtr results that we made money despite our inherently long cash positions. - because starting early in '07 our mortgage trading desk started putting on big short positions,''--big short positions--``mostly using the ABX index, which is a family of indicies designed to replicate cash bonds. And did so in enough quantity that we were net short, and made money (substantial $$ in the 3rd quarter) as the subprime market weakened. (This remains our position today)'' Was that accurate when you wrote it?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes, it was accurate."
"Senator Levin","OK. I think that is a pretty good description of what happened. Now let me go back to you, Mr. Viniar. I do have a problem with taking a short position on a security that you are selling to your customer. You can say, and I am sure it is true, that positions change all the time. That is your answer about the conflict of interest. You are selling a security--you are holding out a security to a customer, and at the same time have decided and are in a short position, and you are going to take the opposite position from your own customer. Now, you can say that your position might change. I am talking about at the time you are selling that security to that customer. Do you think that a customer has a right to believe that you want that security to succeed?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think that a customer has a right to believe that we--it is not a question of succeeding or not succeeding-- "
"Senator Levin","Yes, that is my question. You can say it is not the question. I am saying, from a customer's perspective, when you hold out securities to sell to a customer, do you think that a customer has a right to believe that you, Goldman Sachs, would like to see that security succeed?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure what succeed actually means, because when customers----"
"Senator Levin","That it would be a good security for them to invest in."
"Mr. Viniar","That customer thinks that the----"
"Senator Levin","No, not the customer thinks----"
"Mr. Viniar","Value of the security will go up."
"Senator Levin","No."
"Mr. Viniar","I don't think----"
"Senator Levin","I am asking, does that customer have a right to believe that you, Goldman Sachs, when you are selling something, believe that that is a solid security?"
"Mr. Viniar","Does that customer have a right to believe that----"
"Senator Levin","To assume----"
"Mr. Viniar","We think the value will go up----"
"Senator Levin","No."
"Mr. Viniar","In that security?"
"Senator Levin","No."
"Mr. Viniar","Because that is----"
"Senator Levin","No. I am asking you whether or not--you put your name on that security. You have got Goldman Sachs. You are selling it."
"Mr. Viniar","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Do you think that a customer has a right to assume that you would like to see that security succeed? That is my question. Look, put yourself in the customer's mind. Do you think that the customer has a right to assume that when you put your imprimatur on a security, that you, Goldman Sachs, would like to see that security pay off?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think when we sell securities to customers, we don't necessarily have a view that they are going to go up or down in value----"
"Senator Levin","I am not asking you that."
"Mr. Viniar","So I am not sure what succeed--I am sorry, Senator. I am not trying to not answer your question."
"Senator Levin","That you----"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure what you mean by succeed."
"Senator Levin","That you are holding out something to them because you think this would be something good, that it is good, it is secure. It is not insecure, it is secure."
"Mr. Viniar","When we sell to them----"
"Senator Levin","I am going to keep using that word, because I want you to understand what is in the customers' minds, that you don't think it is junk. You don't think it is crap. You don't think it is shi**y."
"Mr. Viniar","Well, it depends on how you mean that. We might----"
"Senator Levin","How I mean it? These are your employees who believe it."
"Mr. Viniar","Can I explain? If we sell something to a client, a customer, let us just say we have owned it and we sell it to them at 20 cents on the dollar. They buy it at 20 cents. It doesn't mean we think it is a terrific piece of paper, but they think it is worth more than 20 cents. Clearly, we think----"
"Senator Levin","If your employee thinks that it is crap, that it is a shi**y deal, do you think that Goldman Sachs ought to be selling that to customers, and when you were on the short side betting against it? I think it is a very clear conflict of interest and I think we have got to deal with it. Now, you don't, apparently."
"Mr. Viniar","I do not necessarily think that is----"
"Senator Levin","And when you heard that your employees in these emails and looking at these deals said, ``God, what a shi**y deal,'' ``God, what a piece of crap,'' when you hear your own employees or read about those in emails, do you feel anything?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think that is very unfortunate to have on email. ."
"Senator Levin","On email?"
"Mr. Viniar","Please don't take that the wrong way."
"Senator Levin","How about feeling that way?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think it is very unfortunate for anyone to have said that in any form."
"Senator Levin","How about to believe that and sell it?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think that is unfortunate, as well."
"Senator Levin","No, that is what you should have started with."
"Mr. Viniar","You are correct. It is."
"Senator Levin","We are going to stand adjourned for 10 minutes because we have a vote on. "
"Senator Coburn","Our hearing will resume. Senator Levin will be back and I will yield back to him when he comes. Mr. Viniar, I am reading a risk factor sheet on the Gray Wolf prospectus and I would just like for you--this is Exhibit 99a.\1\ It is page 23. It is probably standard boilerplate, but I want to read it to you and get your reaction in light of Monday morning quarterbacking, all right? And I am all the way down to the next-to-last paragraph.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 99a, which appears in the Appendix on page 614.  ``The obligations of the Collateral Manager to the issuer are not exclusive. The Collateral Manager and its affiliates may have other clients--''"
"Mr. Viniar","Excuse me, Dr. Coburn. I am sorry. Which page of this again?"
"Senator Coburn","It is page 23."
"Mr. Viniar","Thank you."
"Senator Coburn","``The Collateral Manager and its affiliates may have other clients, including certain holders of any class of notes, which may invest, directly or indirectly, in the same or similar securities or financial instruments as those in which the issuer invests or that would be appropriate for the inclusion in the issuer's holdings.'' And then the final paragraph, ``The Collateral Manager may make investment decisions for other clients and for affiliates that may be different from those made by the Collateral Manager on behalf of the issuer.'' Are you telling people by that disclaimer that you may sell them something long and then go short against it?"
"Mr. Viniar","I mean----"
"Senator Coburn","What is the purpose of that disclaimer?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am just not familiar with this document or this disclaimer."
"Senator Coburn","It is pretty well covered in almost everything you all have written, that same disclaimer. What does it say to you? You are an accountant, not a lawyer, and neither am I, but what does that say to you? Because you are telling people in this prospectus that you may sell to other clients or affiliates, which means your own business, that you may take a position opposite of that, correct?"
"Mr. Viniar","That is what it says."
"Senator Coburn","That is what it says. OK. I just wanted to clarify that. Now, I want to go back to something I asked the young man on panel one, which was associated with is there a policy at Goldman about directing conversations through corporate email and limiting those to things that should not be put in email? Is there a policy?"
"Mr. Viniar","There is no policy that I am aware of."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Thank you. Mr. Broderick, I want to spend some time with you, if I may. Would you go to Exhibit 63, please.\1\ I will just read it, if you have found it. This is from Patrick Welch to you, Mike Dinias, Robert Berry, Lee Hemphill, Wildermuth, and I guess that is Rapfogel.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 63, which appears in the Appendix on page 477.  ``Craig, I realize this may be too late, but two comments: Just fyi not for the memo, my understanding is that the desk is no longer buying subprime. (We are low balling on bids.)'' Why would this be excluded from the memo?"
"Mr. Broderick","I don't think that it implies that it was excluded from the memo. He just is referencing the fact that his comments may be too late for inclusion in the memo, but it doesn't actually say whether it was in the memo or not."
"Senator Coburn","OK, but the point is the desk was no longer buying subprime, and you knew that."
"Mr. Broderick","It says the desk is bidding lower than it would otherwise do with the effect of not certainly being aggressive as they were."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Which desk does that email refer to? Who are they talking about?"
"Mr. Broderick","It does not specify, but it was one of the desks within the mortgage----"
"Senator Coburn","One of the desks that would buy subprime mortgages, correct?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","And who is Patrick Welch?"
"Mr. Broderick","He is a gentleman in our credit function."
"Senator Coburn","Does he work within the mortgage----"
"Mr. Broderick","No. He works in the----"
"Senator Coburn","He works within the risk management----"
"Mr. Broderick","He works within the risk management group."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Who do you think they were lowballing on bids, clients or customers?"
"Mr. Broderick","These would have been clients from whom we buy mortgage product, subprime----"
"Senator Coburn","And then packaged and--OK."
"Mr. Broderick","Right. But lowballing in this case is not a bidding less than fair or anything----"
"Senator Coburn","No. It is just saying you are going low so it is not as attractive for them to bring them to you and they will bring them to somebody else."
"Mr. Broderick","And they will bring them to someone else."
"Senator Coburn","Understand. I have no criticism for that and I am not making any judgment on it. What happened, in your opinion, in the March time frame for your company to make the determination to no longer buy subprime? You are a risk manager. You are involved in that thought and decision making and research. What happened?"
"Mr. Broderick","This was entirely consistent with the strategy that--with the direction provided by David Viniar and other senior managers of the firm that we be less long in our mortgage business generally."
"Senator Coburn","OK. But as a risk manager, what are the inciting events for them to do that? You are sitting there looking at it as a risk manager. What caused them to make that turn? Was it, as testified in the first panel, we started seeing a deceleration and an increase in housing prices, or we started seeing subprimes not performing? What was it that led to that conclusion within your firm?"
"Mr. Broderick","Well, the meeting itself was chaired, and in fact initiated, by Mr. Viniar, so----"
"Senator Coburn","He was seeing daily losses, I know from his testimony----"
"Mr. Broderick","I mean, that is the feedback that we had, as well, which was that this was a business that had long been, a small but relatively stable part of the Goldman portfolio of businesses. We went into it willingly on the basis of low risk and comparatively low return. We thought we understood the risks pretty well. And therefore, when we started seeing, as Mr. Viniar has talked about in his opening remarks, when we started seeing profit volatility in excess of that which we would normally expect to see, it just raised in our mind the question that maybe we didn't thoroughly understand what was going on in the market and therefore maybe we should start getting shorter, and----"
"Senator Coburn","Can you give me, and for the benefit of those listening, can you give me another scenario in the past 5 years where Goldman has seen the same kind of thing happen in some other product that they handled, where you are looking like you are going to have to mark to market and you are seeing this decline? Can either of you give another example so that people can see that this is not a single event, that it is a multiple event?"
"Mr. Viniar","Sure. The same thing happened with leveraged loans in 2008. We were long in many leveraged loans, unfortunately, and the market clearly started to decline. We were marking things to market. We were marking them down and we sold them. We sold some at prices that people who bought them that continued to go down, and we sold some at distressed prices and since then they have recovered and they have made money on them. But we just felt our risk was just too big and our instructions were that we should reduce our risk, because that market was in very--ended up in severe distress."
"Senator Coburn","Now, there are some significant risk factors going on in commercial real estate. Do you all have big holdings in commercial real estate mortgages?"
"Mr. Viniar","They are not that big anymore. We have either marked them----"
"Senator Coburn","You have gotten close to home on that?"
"Mr. Viniar","Not as close as we would have liked, but a lot closer than we were."
"Senator Coburn","OK. And were there collateralized debt obligations on these, and were there mortgage-backed securities on these, as well?"
"Mr. Broderick","Yes, there were."
"Senator Coburn","Was it to the same extent that you had involvement in those as you had in the residential mortgage?"
"Mr. Broderick","I don't know precisely what the numbers are, but we were active in----"
"Senator Coburn","In both markets?"
"Mr. Broderick","We were active in both markets."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Thank you."
"Mr. Broderick","Multi-small sector CDOs were very often included commercial mortgage-backed securities."
"Senator Coburn","Mr. Broderick, do you think, or do feel any of the CDOs or the Abacus transaction had any reputational risk for Goldman?"
"Mr. Broderick","Do I think that Abacus had any reputational risk for Goldman? With the benefit of hindsight, one version certainly did."
"Senator Coburn","The last----"
"Mr. Broderick","The ACA 2007, yes."
"Senator Coburn","All right. How about any of the CDOs?"
"Mr. Broderick","We structured these products very carefully. We structured them with the best of intent. They accurately, I think, reflected in terms of disclosure and so forth, the underlying assets in the portfolios. They were purchased by sophisticated investors who had a great deal of detail on the underlying securities that went into them, the underlying assets that went into them. I think they performed in a manner consistent with that which the market itself performed."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Earlier, Senator Ensign asked the first panel about whether or not they thought the motivational system of payment based on year-end bonuses, production, etc., led to a less than ethical--or compromised an ethical position. I would just like for you to comment for a minute, what is the ethical creed of Goldman Sachs? How is it manifested? How does the Board look at ethics? Do they have an Ethics Department? Is there an Ethics Department that actually manifests those standards among the Goldman employees, and if not, why not?"
"Mr. Viniar","You asked a lot of questions there, Senator, but we care very much about ethics at Goldman Sachs and we don't believe in any way, shape, or form that our compensation is not consistent with people having good ethical standards. In fact, just the opposite, and I think some people on our panel said that this morning. When we look at people's reviews, our year-end review--you looked at just a self-evaluation, but if you looked at the evaluation of our people, what we call a 360-degree review that everybody at Goldman Sachs has, it is not just commercial production. There are questions in there that are asked to people in their department, outside their department, senior and junior, about leadership, culture, values, diversity, their ethical standards, etc. And if people do not do well there, something would happen between their compensation being reduced and them no longer being at Goldman Sachs. So we pay a lot of attention to that and we care very deeply about it."
"Senator Coburn","Is there a Board process that leads on that? What are the standards? If I go to work for Goldman Sachs, what am I going to hear about ethics when I am hired?"
"Mr. Viniar","You will get the Goldman Sachs Business Principles, which everybody gets, which are 14 business principles that we live by. You will have training. You will have orientation. You will have many different venues in which we will talk about what is expected of you, and that will not just happen when you join Goldman Sachs. That will happen when you get promoted. If you are a managing director, there will be training where that is discussed. So it happens throughout your career at Goldman Sachs."
"Senator Coburn","Looking backwards at Abacus, would you feel that the system worked for Abacus? Do you think there is any ethical question that can be raised on Abacus? Could a non- biased person look at the facts and raise an ethical question about that deal?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure I am non-biased."
"Senator Coburn","Well, I am not saying you are. You should be biased for Goldman. I understand it. But could a non-biased look at the facts as you see them and say there is a question of unethical behavior here?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't believe so."
"Senator Coburn","You don't think so?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't believe so."
"Senator Coburn","Do you think it was ethical for Goldman to release all the personal emails of Mr. Tourre?"
"Mr. Viniar","I have no view. I don't think it was unethical."
"Senator Coburn","You don't think it is unethical?"
"Mr. Viniar","No."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Did you release any of the other personal emails on any of the other people who have testified before this Subcommittee?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't know."
"Senator Coburn","I haven't seen them. I will yield to the Chairman, because I am fine. I am doing well."
"Mr. Viniar","Chairman Levin, can I just address the answer to the last question you asked before you left----"
"Senator Levin","Sure."
"Mr. Viniar","Because I want to just make clear what I said to you at the end, which is that I think you were 100 percent correct in what you said to me, how I should have phrased that, that I should have started with, yes, I feel bad that anyone would have thought that at all, not just whether they wrote it or put it on email. So I just want to clarify that and repeat it again, because once again, you were 100 percent correct."
"Senator Levin","I would have hoped you would have said you were appalled as your first reaction. I would have just hoped that you would have said, as someone who holds yourself out to customers, that it was appalling when you heard about that. The only other question that I have for you, and this goes to something which my friend, Dr. Coburn, said about short sales, there is a place for short sales. I happen to agree with that. My problem comes particularly where you are selling a security to someone, particularly when it is described as your employees described it, and we have gone into that as to their description of some of those sales, and at the same time, you are betting against it. You are going short. That does seem to me to be a very clear conflict, where it is your intention to hold a short position on a security where you are selling it to a customer. That is not a temporary position, and I know positions change. I understand that. The second thing which I am troubled by in this area the big picture is that I have difficulty when a firm such as yours, has a strategic position to basically invest against the market, to bet against the market, and to be selling securities that are long in the same market. I have a problem with that, but that is a hard issue to resolve. But if it comes to specific securities, particularly described as your employees describe some of these that they were selling, going short and intending to keep a short position, to bet against the securities that you are selling, does, to me, create a conflict unless you disclose to your customer that you are, in fact, taking a short position, not temporarily, not as a market maker, but that is your proprietary position. But there is another area where I think there has been a real difficulty displayed today and that is when I went into the subject with the first panel about a customer saying on the phone to you, you are holding out a security to a customer to buy and the customer says, how can you get comfortable with that deal given the fact that New Century, which was known as a very dubious supplier of these mortgages, it has all the New Century collateral? Now, in that case, there was a big problem because your people were asked a question, a direct question. How can you get comfortable? The answer to that question is, you weren't comfortable because you were going short. Instead, they kept trying to sell that security. That seems to me to be misleading, as well."
"Senator Coburn","Can I jump in here?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","I have a couple of questions for you. We have a proposed fix-it bill for financial regulation, and based on what you have heard and seen, do you have an opinion on whether that will solve some of the problems that led to the financial situation that this country has faced over the last 2\1/2\ years?"
"Mr. Viniar","We, as a firm, are generally supportive of financial regulation and I think there are some things in the bill that will fix some of the problems, but I don't think it addresses some of the other problems."
"Senator Coburn","Do you think that the Federal Government ought to fix the problems with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?"
"Mr. Viniar","I don't know enough to answer that."
"Senator Coburn","They have got about a trillion dollars worth of taxpayer money right now, all of it at risk, and one of the leading causes for over-speculation in the housing market, and you don't have an opinion on it? I mean, I don't want to get you in trouble with whoever your friends are around here, but the point is, we need to fix the real problems, not the symptoms, and you don't have an opinion on whether we ought to address the issues with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?"
"Mr. Viniar","Not really."
"Senator Coburn","OK. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","I have one more question. The firm claims that your clients come first, and we have seen many, too many instances today where that has not been the case, where you put Goldman's interest ahead of your clients, selling securities that you had real doubts about, betting against those same securities, taking a short position which your client wanted but you said, we will save that for ourselves. Your first business principle, according to your Exhibit 58,\1\ is, ``Our clients' interests always come first,'' and they don't. There is a conflict of interest in many cases where you put your own interests first. You are selling stuff out of your inventory which you call cats and dogs and you call bad lemons. So the conflict of interest issue and the fact that you don't always put your client first, you put your own firm's proprietary interests first in many cases, kind of goes to the heart of the conflict.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 58, which appears in the Appendix on page 466.  It is similar to the conflict which exists with those credit rating agencies. We can kind of talk about examples of the conflict, but at the heart of it is the problem that they are paid to give credit ratings by the people whose securities they are rating, and that means there is pressure on them to put AAA ratings on them. We went into that at our third hearing. And there is an inherent conflict of interest there, as well. So that is the area that I am most interested in in terms of the legislation, to strengthen it in the conflicts of interest area, where I think there is room to be strengthened. I now want to yield to Senator Pryor before we excuse this panel."
"Senator Pryor","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would like to really follow up with where you left off, and that is on the conflict of interest question. I guess really the question for Goldman Sachs is, are there times in which you recognize a conflict?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure what you mean by recognize a conflict."
"Senator Pryor","Well, I think for most Americans, when they understand that you create a market and then you also are playing in that market and you have clients that you are enticing into that market, it seems to me that is an area that is rife for conflicts of interest, because you want the market to be successful. You are charging fees. You may be advising clients. But your interests may be different than the clients' interest because you may be in a different position, like the previous panel said. So do you recognize that as a conflict of interest?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure I am answering your question, but we try to resolve conflicts all the time at Goldman Sachs. We, for example, could have two clients who want to buy the same company and they will both ask us to represent them. That is a conflict. We will have to resolve it. We could have a seller and a buyer who ask us. That is a conflict. We could have a situation where there is a company--a client who wants to buy something and our merchant bank wants to buy it, as well. We will have to decide principal versus franchise, and almost every time we will choose the franchise over the principal. So we wrestle with these all the time. We try our best to resolve them and make the right judgment, putting our clients first."
"Senator Pryor","But when it comes to doing something like selling CDOs, do you see any conflict there, or do you just see that as a function of the market?"
"Mr. Viniar","We generally try to create products that our customers want to buy and sell them to them at prices that they think are attractive and that they think will be profitable for them."
"Senator Pryor","So, in other words, in the CDO market, you didn't see any conflicts there?"
"Mr. Viniar","Not that I am aware of."
"Senator Pryor","OK. We haven't really talked a whole lot about credit rating agency reform. I know Senator Levin just mentioned the fact that I think the credit rating agencies, they played a role in all this, as well. I have actually had a bill here in the Senate to reform them. But regardless of that, do you think that there are reforms that should be made with the credit rating business?"
"Mr. Viniar","My interaction with credit rating agencies is basically limited to when they rate Goldman Sachs, and I think that process works pretty well. So I am just not close enough to the rest of it."
"Senator Pryor","And, in general terms, what is Goldman Sachs' relationship with credit rating agencies?"
"Mr. Viniar","We have a multi-faceted relationship. We have, of course, the relationship where they rate us."
"Senator Pryor","Right."
"Mr. Viniar","So they rate Goldman Sachs. They will rate securities, as we have talked about this morning, that we create and structure. And they also rate securities of our clients. So we will work with our clients to help individual corporations get ratings on the securities. Sometimes, clients who have not been rated before need help and advice in going to rating agencies and so we will help them and advise them, as well. So it is multi-faceted."
"Senator Pryor","And as part of your multi-faceted relationship with them, are there circumstances in which you pay them fees?"
"Mr. Viniar","Well, I know we pay them for sure when they rate our own securities, so if Goldman Sachs issues debt, we have to pay a fee for the rating on that. And, Craig, I believe there are some other circumstances where, if they are rating a security we create, sometimes it comes out of the transaction. Sometimes we as structurer will pay them."
"Senator Pryor","And does that present any conflicts of interest in your mind?"
"Mr. Viniar","I am not sure."
"Senator Pryor","Tell me what you mean, you are not sure."
"Mr. Viniar","There is an argument you are making that if the issuer of securities is paying the rating agencies, then there could be a conflict, as opposed to the purchaser of securities. So there is an argument on both sides of that."
"Senator Pryor","Mr. Broderick, did you want to comment on any potential conflicts of interest with the credit rating agencies?"
"Mr. Broderick","No. I think Mr. Viniar addressed it exactly as I would have."
"Senator Pryor","Let me ask, if I may, and I am not sure which one, but I will go ahead and ask this to Mr. Broderick. What is Goldman Sachs' policy on employees shorting asset- backed securities, CDOs, CDLs, and credit default swaps in which Goldman Sachs acted as a market maker or owned for its own account? Do you have a policy about that?"
"Mr. Broderick","We have very rigorous compliance policies which address the securities trading activities of all of our employees. I don't know the details of it specifically as relates to the instruments that you specifically noted, but our compliance group has access to all the securities trading activities of our employees and monitor it carefully and ensure compliance with these strict policies that I mentioned."
"Senator Pryor","And when you have compliance, are you talking about compliance with SEC and other rules and regulations, or are you talking about compliance with your own company policy?"
"Mr. Broderick","Both."
"Senator Pryor","OK. And you are not aware if you have any company policy about how you treat shorts when you are a market maker?"
"Mr. Broderick","Not beyond what I articulated initially. Mr. Viniar, I don't know if you have any more detail."
"Mr. Viniar","I don't know, Senator."
"Senator Pryor","OK. Mr. Chairman, thank you. That is all I have."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator Pryor. Senator Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","I just had two follow-up questions. You are generally supportive of the Dodd bill, was your testimony. Are you supportive of reinstallation of Glass-Steagall?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think it would be very difficult to reinstate Glass-Steagall."
"Senator Coburn","Very difficult to what?"
"Mr. Viniar","To reinstate Glass-Steagall."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Are you supportive of something similar to or the Volcker Rule?"
"Mr. Viniar","I think there are issues with the Volcker Rule. I think there are issues with what it would do to the competitiveness of the U.S. financial institutions, because I suspect nothing like that will be instituted anywhere outside the United States, and so I think you will find U.S. financial institutions----"
"Senator Coburn","The export of the derivatives market outside of the United States?"
"Mr. Viniar","I also think you will find non-U.S. financial institutions able to be stronger than U.S. financial institutions."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Thank you both. You are both excused. "
"Senator Levin","We now will call our final witness for today's hearing, Lloyd Blankfein, the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Goldman Sachs. Mr. Blankfein, we appreciate your being with us today. Pursuant to Rule 6, all witnesses who testify before the Subcommittee are required to be sworn, so we would ask you to stand and raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you are about to give will be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you, God?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, I do. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much. I don't know if you have heard the earlier testimony or not, but we use a timing system which will give you a red light in 5 minutes. The light will turn yellow after 4 minutes so that you can try to give us your testimony, if possible, in 5 minutes. "
"TESTIMONY OF LLOYD C. BLANKFEIN,\1\ CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, THE GOLDMAN SACHS GROUP, INC., NEW YORK, NEW YORK"," "
"Mr. Blankfein","Thank you, Chairman Levin, Ranking Member Coburn, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the invitation to appear before you today as you examine some of the causes and consequences of the financial crisis.  \1\ The prepared statement of Mr. Blankfein appears in the Appendix on page 225.  Today, the financial system is fragile, but it is largely stable. This stability is the result of decisive and necessary government action during the fall of 2008. Like other financial institutions, Goldman Sachs received an investment from the government as a part of its various efforts to fortify our markets and the economy during a very difficult time. I want to express my gratitude and the gratitude of our entire firm. We held the government's investment for approximately 8 months and repaid it in full, along with a 23 percent annualized return for taxpayers. Until recently, most Americans had never heard of Goldman Sachs or weren't sure what it did. We don't have banking branches. We provide very few mortgages and don't issue credit cards or loans to consumers. Instead, we generally work with companies, governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and other investing institutions. These clients usually come to Goldman Sachs for one or more of the following reasons: They want financial advice; they need financing; they want to buy or sell a stock, bond, or other financial instrument; or they want help in managing and growing their financial assets. The nearly 35,000 people who work at Goldman Sachs, the majority of whom work in the United States, are hard working, diligent, and thoughtful. Through them, we help governments raise capital to fund schools and roads. We advise companies and provide them funds to invest in their growth. We work with pension funds, labor unions, and university endowments to help build and secure their assets for generations to come. And we connect buyers and sellers in the securities markets, contributing to the liquidity and vitality of our financial system. These functions are important to economic growth and job creation. I recognize, however, that many Americans are skeptical about the contribution of investment banking to our economy and understandably angry about how Wall Street contributed to the financial crisis. As a firm, we are trying to deal with the implications of the crisis for ourselves and for the system. What we and other banks, rating agencies, and regulators failed to do was sound the alarm that there was too much lending and too much leverage in the system, that credit had become too cheap. One consequence of the growth of the housing market was that instruments that pooled mortgages and their risk became overly complex. That complexity and the fact that some instruments couldn't be easily bought or sold compounded the effects of the crisis. While derivatives are an important tool to help companies and financial institutions manage their risk, we need more transparency for the public and regulators as well as safeguards in the system for their use. That is why Goldman Sachs, in supporting regulatory reform, has made it clear that it supports clearinghouses for eligible derivatives and higher capital requirements for non-standard instruments. As you know, 10 days ago, the SEC announced a civil action against Goldman Sachs in connection with a specific transaction. It was one of the worst days of my professional life, as I know it was for every person at our firm. We believe deeply in a culture that prizes teamwork, depends on honesty, and rewards saying no as much as saying yes. We have been a client-centered firm for 140 years, and if our clients believe that we don't deserve their trust, we cannot survive. While we strongly disagree with the SEC's complaint, I also recognize how such a complicated transaction may look to many people. To them, it is confirmation of how out of control they believe Wall Street has become, no matter how sophisticated the parties or what disclosures were made. We have to do a better job of striking the balance between what an informed client believes is important to his or her investing goals and what the public believes is overly complex and risky. Finally, Mr. Chairman, the Subcommittee is focused on the more specific issues revolving around the mortgage securitization market. I think it is important to consider these issues in the context of risk management. We believe that strong, conservative risk management is fundamental and helps define Goldman Sachs. Our risk management processes did not and could not provide for absolute clarity. They highlighted uncertainty about evolving conditions in the housing market. That uncertainty dictated our decision to attempt to reduce the firm's overall risk. Much has been said about the supposedly massive short Goldman Sachs had on the U.S. housing market. The fact is, we were not consistently or significantly net short the market in residential mortgage-related products in 2007 and 2008. Our performance in our residential market-related business confirms this. During the 2 years of the financial crisis, while profitable overall, Goldman Sachs lost approximately $1.2 billion from our activities in the residential housing market. We didn't have a massive short against the housing market and we certainly did not bet against our clients. Rather, we believe that we managed our risk as our shareholders and our regulators would expect. Mr. Chairman, thank you for the opportunity to address these issues. I look forward to your questions."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Mr. Blankfein. We have heard in earlier panels today example after example where Goldman was selling securities to people and not telling them that they were taking and intended to maintain a short position against those same securities. I am deeply troubled by that, and it is made worse when your own employees believe that those securities are junk or a piece of crap or a shi**y deal, words that those emails show your employees believed about a number of those deals. Billion-dollar Timberwolf: A synthetic CDO-squared--CDOs get squared now--a senior executive called it a ``shi**y'' transaction, but the Goldman sales force was told that it was a priority item for 2 straight months. Goldman sold $600 million in Timberwolf securities to clients while at the same timeholding a short position, in other words, betting against it. The CDO went to junk status in about 7 months. Your investors lost big time, but Goldman won on that deal; you profited on that deal. In the $500 million Long Beach RMBS deal, Goldman shorted it at the same time that it was selling it to clients. The securities defaulted within a few years with a 65 percent delinquency rate. The bad news, in your own words, was that your clients lost money, but the good news is that Goldman Sachs made money on that deal. The next one, the $700 million Fremont deal. This was a RMBS of subprime loans from a notoriously bad lender. Your folks knew it. One of your clients talks to your sales force about it, and your sales force among themselves call it ``crap loans.'' They go out and sell them anyway. At the same time that your sales people are selling those items, they are shorting the deal. So you short them so that Goldman makes money when this security fails, which it did in 10 months. On the $300 million Anderson synthetic CDO, the CDO is stuffed with New Century loans. These are known to be shoddy loans. I think it was one or two on the list of bad loan producers. A client of yours asked, how did Goldman Sachs get comfortable with this deal? In other words, pointing out that it was New Century. Goldman Sachs didn't respond and did not say, we are not comfortable, we are shorting it. We are betting against this deal. Asked a direct question, how can you guys get comfortable with a deal involving those loans, and instead of responding honestly, we have got problems, too, we are not taking any chances on this deal, we may be selling it, but we are also betting against it, that is not what happened. Instead, the client was told that Goldman was an equity holder, which it was at the same time, but that was a half-truth because it was also betting against that same security. That CDO failed within 7 months. Your clients lost. Goldman profited. The $2 billion Hudson synthetic CDO: Goldman Sachs was the sole protection buyer on this CDO with a $2 billion short. In other words, they were betting against it. A Goldman sales person described it as junk, not to the buyer, of course, but inside. The CDO imploded within 2 years. Your clients lost. Goldman profited. Now, there is such a fundamental conflict, it seems to me, when Goldman is selling securities which--particularly when its own people believe they are bad items, described in the way these emails show that they were described and what your own sales people believed about them--to go out and sell these securities to people and then bet against those same securities, it seems to me, is a fundamental conflict of interest and raises a real ethical issue. I would like to ask you whether or not you believe that Goldman, in fact, treated those clients properly. As you say, if clients believe we don't deserve their trust, you are not going to survive. Those are the ringing words you give us in your opening statement. Given that kind of a history here, going heavily short in a market, which you did--you made a strategic decision to do that--but then on these specific examples to be betting against the very securities which you are selling to your clients, and internally your own people believe that these are crappy securities, how do you expect to deserve the trust of your clients, and is there not an inherent conflict here?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, Senator, there is a lot in your question and I am sure we are going to spend a lot of time on different parts of it. Our clients' trust is not only important to us, it is essential to us. It is why we are as successful a firm as we are and have been for 140 years. We are one of the largest client franchises in market making in these kinds of activities we are talking about now, and our client base is a critical client base for us and they know our activities and they understand what market making is."
"Senator Levin","Do you think they know that you think something is a piece of crap when you sell it to them and then bet against it? Do you think they know that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I don't know who the ``they'' is and----"
"Senator Levin","We went through it today."
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I know. I know, Senator, and there were individual emails that were picked out and some people thought something. But I will tell you----"
"Senator Levin","I am just asking you a question. Do you think if your people think something is a piece of crap and go out and sell that, and then your company bets against it, do you think that deserves your trust?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I want to make one thing clear. When you say we sell something and then our customer bets against it----"
"Senator Levin","No. You bet against it."
"Mr. Blankfein","We bet against it, we are principals. The act of selling something is what gives us the opposite position of what the client has. If the client asks us for a bid and we buy it from them, the next minute, we own it. They don't. If they ask to buy it from us, the next minute, they own it and we don't. We could cover that risk. But the nature of the principal business and market making is that we are the other side of what our clients want to do."
"Senator Levin","When you sell something to a client, they think, presumably, you are rid of it. It is no longer in your inventory."
"Mr. Blankfein","Not necessarily."
"Senator Levin","Not necessarily, but they have at least a right to believe that you want that security to work for them. That is a belief which I would think most customers would have. In example after example, it is not just that you sold something, which obviously meant someone was buying it. There is a seller and a buyer. That is not what we are talking about. We are talking about betting against the very thing that you are selling, betting against it, going short against it without disclosing that to that client. Do you think people would buy securities from you if you said, we want you to know this. We are going to sell you this, but we are going out and buying insurance against this security succeeding. We are taking a short position. We are getting this thing out of our inventory. We are betting against this very thing we are selling to you. That is a totally different thing from selling a security and no longer having an interest in it. Is there not a conflict when you sell something to somebody and then are determined to bet against that same security and you don't disclose that to the person you are selling it to? Do you see a problem?"
"Mr. Blankfein","In the context of market making, that is not a conflict. What clients are buying, or customers are buying, is they are buying an exposure. The thing that we are selling to them is supposed to give them the risk they want. They are not coming to us to represent what our views are. They probably--the institutional clients we have wouldn't care what our views are. They shouldn't care. We do other things at the firm. We are advisors. We manage their money. There are parts of the business where we are fiduciaries."
"Senator Levin","Yes, and that is the part that is very confusing to folks, they think you----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I know."
"Senator Levin","They think you are fiduciaries, and then----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Not in the market making context."
"Senator Levin","Yes, but they are not told that not only are you not a fiduciary, you are betting against the very security that you are selling to them. You don't disclose that. That is worse than not being a fiduciary."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator Levin."
"Senator Levin","That is being in a conflict of interest situation."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't think our clients care or they should care what our positions are----"
"Senator Levin","That you are betting against the security you are selling to them? They don't care?"
"Mr. Blankfein","You say betting against----"
"Senator Levin","Yes. You are betting. You are going short against the very security. You are holding a short position against the very security. I read you over and over and over again, you are selling securities, many of which are described as crap by your own sales force internally. Putting that aside just for a moment--we will come back to that. That makes it worse. But there is an inherent conflict when you don't disclose to your client that this security you are buying from us has obviously a short side, but we are the people who are keeping the short on this one. We are betting against this security succeeding, and you don't think that is relevant to a client?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We live in different contexts and this is a professional--this is a market----"
"Senator Levin","I am just calling it in an inhuman context."
"Mr. Blankfein","In a human context, the markets work on transparency with respect to what the item is. It doesn't carry representations just of what a position a seller has. Just think of buying from a stock exchange or a futures market. You are not even supposed to know who is on the other side. You could have the biggest mutual fund in the world selling all its position in something. They could hate it. You would never know that if you were the buyer of a stock, who was selling it or why they were selling it. Liquidity in the market demands transparency, that the thing is supposed to do what it is supposed to do. The people who are coming to us for risk in the housing market wanted to have a security that gave them exposure to the housing market and that is what they got. The unfortunate thing, and it is unfortunate but it doesn't--is that the housing market went south very quickly after some of the securities--not all of them, because some of them were done early--but they went south, and so people lost money in it. But the security itself delivered the specific exposure that the client wanted to have."
"Senator Levin","You don't believe it is relevant to a customer of yours that you are selling a security to that you are betting against that same security. You just don't think it is relevant and needs to be disclosed. Is that the bottom line?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, and the people who are selling it in our firm wouldn't even know what the firm's position is and----"
"Senator Levin","Oh, yes, they did."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, we have 35,000 people and thousands of traders making markets throughout our firm. They might have an idea, but they might not have an idea."
"Senator Levin","Oh. Now you are saying they might know."
"Mr. Blankfein","And the next day, it might be different."
"Senator Levin","They have an idea, more than an idea in these cases. But putting that aside, what do you think about selling securities which your own people think are crap? Does that bother you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think they would--again, as a hypothetical----"
"Senator Levin","No, this is real."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, then I don't----"
"Senator Levin","We heard it today. This is a shi**y deal. This is crap."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, Senator----"
"Senator Levin","Four or five examples. What is your reaction to that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think there are a lot of opinions about how a security will perform against the market it is in."
"Senator Levin","How about the sales person?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think that the investors that we are dealing with, on the long side or on the short side, know what they want to acquire and probably if they asked a sales person his or her opinion, that sales person owes a duty of honesty. But otherwise, the sales person is representing what that security is and what the position in that security will accomplish. And as far as whether something is a weak security or going bad, we are selling securities all the time that are weak, that we ourselves don't like. It is just a function of the price in the market. I bet some of those securities, and I don't know specifically, which are the subject of those comments can be bought today for a willing buyer and a seller at cents on the dollar. As long as people know--I think there are people who are making rational decisions today to buy securities for pennies on the dollar because they think it will go up, and the sellers of those securities are happy to get the pennies because they think they will go down."
"Senator Levin","I understand that. We are talking where you were the seller of the security and you, Goldman Sachs--believe it is a piece of crap, where you----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We were sellers----"
"Senator Levin","Where you, as part of the deal--I am talking about this. I am not talking about where you are selling securities out of your inventory. I understand that. People come to you, you buy securities. I am talking about where the deal is that you are selling as you in the short position and intending to keep that position. That is the deal, and whether there is not an obligation then to disclose to the people you are selling to in that deal--Goldman, we may be selling it to you, but we believe that this thing is going the other direction. We are taking the short position. You don't see any conflict in that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think in those transactions in which we underwrote, I believe, and I am not looking at specific--in fact, my understanding is that is disclosed, that we can have a short or a long position in those securities."
"Senator Levin","And where you take a short position, do you think that should be disclosed? Where you are betting against that same security you are selling--yes or no, do you think that ought to be disclosed or not?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, you keep using the word ``betting against''----"
"Senator Levin","Yes. You are taking the short position and you are staying. You intend to keep it. That is a bet against that security----"
"Mr. Blankfein","If somebody bought----"
"Senator Levin","Succeeding."
"Mr. Blankfein","As a market maker----"
"Senator Levin","No, just try my question."
"Mr. Blankfein","I have to be able to----"
"Senator Levin","No, just try my question. In a deal where you are selling securities and you are intending to keep the short side of that deal, which is what happened here in a lot of these deals, do you think you have an obligation to tell the person that you are selling that security to in that deal that you are keeping the short position in that deal?"
"Mr. Blankfein","That we are not going to cover it in the market?"
"Senator Levin","That is----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, no----"
"Senator Levin","That you intend to keep that short position. Not forever. It is your intention to keep that short position."
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I don't think we would have to tell them. I don't even know that we would know ourselves what we were going to do. Even if we intended----"
"Senator Levin","I said, where you intend to keep a short position."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't think we would--I don't think we would disclose that, and I don't know--again, intention for a market maker is a very----"
"Senator Levin","How about you are investing in these securities. This isn't a market making deal. This is where you have a decision to bet against, to take the short side of a security that you are selling, and you don't think that there is any moral obligation here? Put aside the legal obligation. You don't think there is an obligation to tell the person that you are selling this to that you are betting against that security by maintaining a short position in it? It is a very straightforward question."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't think so. I am trying to answer it. Or, for that matter, if a client came to us and asked us to buy something from him and we intended to hold the long position, I don't think we have an obligation of telling him that our intention is to hold it. In half of every----"
"Senator Levin","That is not the opposite side from that client. That is the same side."
"Mr. Blankfein","No, it is not. It is the opposite side."
"Senator Levin","No. You said a client comes to you and wants to sell you something. You decide whether to buy it or not."
"Mr. Blankfein","Every transaction, Senator, and this is--and I think it is important, and again, I am not trying to be resistant but to make sure your terminology--when as a market maker, we are buying from sellers and selling to buyers----"
"Senator Levin","But I am saying where you are not selling to anyone else, you are selling to somebody and you are taking the opposite position. You are betting. You are going out and getting a default swap, however it is done. You are betting against the very security that you are selling to that person. You don't see any problem? You don't see that you have to disclose, when you have put together a deal and you go looking for people to buy those securities, it just adds insult to injury when your people think it is a pile of junk. But the underlying injury is that you have determined that you are going to keep the opposite position from the security that you are selling to someone. You just don't see any obligation to disclose that. That is what seems to be coming through here."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't believe there is a disclosure obligation, but as a market maker, I am not sure how a market would work if it was premised on the assumption that the other side of the market cared what your opinion was about the position they were taking."
"Senator Levin","Do they have a belief that you, at least when you are going out peddling securities, that you want that security to succeed? Don't they have that right to assume that if you are going out selling securities, that you have a belief that is something which would be good for that client?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think we have to have a belief, and we do have a belief that if somebody wants an exposure to housing----"
"Senator Levin","They don't want--you are out there selling it to them. You are out there selling these securities. This isn't someone walking in the door."
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I want----"
"Senator Levin","You are picking up the phone. You are calling all these people. You don't tell them that you think it is a piece of junk. You don't tell them that this is a security which incorporates or which in some way references a whole lot of bad stuff in your own inventory--bad lemons, they were called. Over and over again, we have emails. You are out there looking around for buyers of stuff, whether it is junk or not junk, where you are betting against what you are selling. You are intending to keep the opposite side. This isn't where you are just selling something from your inventory. This is where you are betting against the very product you are selling, and you are just not troubled by it. That is the bottom line. There is no trouble in your mind----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I am sorry. I can't endorse your characterization."
"Senator Levin","It is a question, not a characterization. I am saying, you are not troubled."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not troubled by the fact that we market make as principal and that we are the opposite--when somebody sells, they sell to us, or when they buy, they buy from us."
"Senator Levin","And where you are betting, keeping a betting interest against the security. It is not just they are buying from you. That is not my issue. They are buying something from you where you solicit them to buy and then you are betting against. You are keeping the short side. You are going out and getting a default swap. Or you are selling the ABX. Whatever it is, you are taking a position against the very security that you are selling and you are not troubled."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, as I--again----"
"Senator Levin","And you want people to trust you."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I think people----"
"Senator Levin","Why would people----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Do trust us."
"Senator Levin","I wouldn't trust you. If you came to me and wanted to sell me securities and you didn't tell me that you have a bet against that same security----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator----"
"Senator Levin","You don't think that affects my thinking?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, we could do a public issue of an oil company tomorrow, an IPO of an oil company that goes out and searches for oil. It is not--when we sell that company, and as an underwriter, we make sure there is due diligence because our obligations of an underwriter are disclosure and due diligence and that is very well established. But we can tell our investors, if they want an exposure to an oil company and they understand the risks and we do a good job in diligence and we do all the disclosures that are required by ourselves and all the regulators, we can sell that security and we will not necessarily disclose and won't even know--and the buyer won't care--we could be negative on the equity market and negative on the oil market. It still won't matter----"
"Senator Levin","Speaking about that security----"
"Mr. Blankfein","To that buyer of the security."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Blankfein, stick to the point. I am talking about that security that you are selling out there. You go out and sell that security, oil security, I don't care what kind it is----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Right."
"Senator Levin","And that you are betting against that same security you are out selling. I have just got to keep repeating this. I am not talking about generally in the market. I am saying you have got a short bet against that security. You don't think the client would care?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't--Senator, I can't speak to what people would care. I would say that the obligations of a market maker are to make sure your clients are suitable and to make sure they understand it. But we are a part of a market process. We do hundreds of thousands, if not millions of transactions a day as a market maker."
"Senator Levin","This is much more than a market maker. You are keeping a proprietary interest in a position that is exactly the opposite of what you are selling."
"Mr. Blankfein","I think----"
"Senator Levin","We are going around and around on this and I don't think we are going to get an answer from you, basically-- "
"Mr. Blankfein","Sorry."
"Senator Levin","That you have any concern about that kind of a situation."
"Senator McCain",""
"Senator McCain","Thank you for being here, Mr. Blankfein. Would you agree that the financial crisis that brought on the greatest recession since the Great Depression was due to a collapse of the housing market?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think it was a number of factors. I don't know whether that was the initial factor, but that certainly was a major, major episode in the collapse."
"Senator McCain","And your involvement in the housing market is not in the direct mortgage business?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Correct."
"Senator McCain","And you received $10 billion as part of"
"TARP?",""
"Mr. Blankfein","An investment was made in Goldman Sachs, yes."
"Senator McCain","And why did you think you needed that money?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think we were part of a group of banks that were brought in, and at the same time had an investment made in by the government in order to stabilize what was a-- maybe it is too strong a word, maybe not--a panic of sorts that caused a lack of confidence in----"
"Senator McCain","But you didn't make any direct home loan mortgages."
"Mr. Blankfein","De minimis."
"Senator McCain","But since it was the housing market that collapsed, you needed $10 billion, and you recovered rather nicely, I guess. I guess you declared earnings for 2009 of some $13 billion, is that correct? Roughly?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know the exact number, but that would be in the ballpark."
"Senator McCain","And your bonus was?"
"Mr. Blankfein","About $9 million."
"Senator McCain","About $9 million. And you are doing pretty well this year, too, according to your earnings and your stock price. You are doing pretty well this year?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Financially, yes."
"Senator McCain","How do you think the community banks are doing, Mr. Blankfein? I think they are doing pretty poorly. They are being closed all the time. They are the ones that make the loans for the mortgages. Do you think they are doing OK, the community banks?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think there is a--the recession--well, whether or not the recession has ended, and I think most people believe it has ended, the consequences of it still grinds on and is creating a substantial hardship."
"Senator McCain","But Goldman is doing pretty well."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator McCain","And one of the reasons, obviously, why Goldman is doing pretty well, before they got the $10 billion of TARP money, of taxpayers' money, there was a November 2007 email from you that stated, ``Of course we didn't dodge the mortgage mess. We lost money, then made more than we lost because of shorts.'' That is a quote from your email that you wrote. How much did you make more than you lost because of shorts?"
"Mr. Blankfein","In this market, in residential housing, we made, for the entire year of 2007, less than $500 million of revenue, and in the succeeding year of the housing crisis, 2008, we lost $1.7 billion. We did not make big money. What I was referring to in my email was that--and this was on the back of a message that was looking at a part of our business and saying they made a lot of money on shorts when I knew that we had a lot of longs and a lot of shorts that netted to a very small position, as our goal during this period was just to manage our risk down."
"Senator McCain","Mr. Blankfein, there is a lot of animosity out there. I am sure you have seen that. We find in my State, for example, 48 percent of the homes are still underwater. In other words, they are worth less, as you know, than the payments that are being made. And the community banks continue to struggle and have great difficulties. You received $10 billion in TARP money and the community banks are the ones that are going under. Maybe you could--do you think that, in the minds of a lot of Americans, that there is a real contradiction there? You are doing fine. You are paid millions of dollars in bonuses. Perhaps you earned them. I am not qualified to say that. Meanwhile, community banks, the ones who were the direct lenders in the housing market, who had direct involvement, the ones that--not you, but that the homeowners relied on are the ones that are struggling and still having enormous difficulty, including my home State of Arizona. Do you see? Do you understand why people might think there is a dichotomy there, Mr. Blankfein, or even unfairness there? And I understand that life isn't fair, but a lot of Americans don't quite understand what went on there. They don't understand what hit them."
"Mr. Blankfein","Absolutely. I think community banks play a very important role. They are not necessarily--again, not knowing--I am not speaking in general or specifically--maybe some helped author their own situation by over-lending or making imprudent judgments. But I am sure for many, they just conducted their social purpose and lent out money against housing, that people who owe them the money can't pay it back, and the housing that they would have as collateral goes down in value, they may very well be victims of the recession and I can understand--and I share your concern for the situation."
"Senator McCain","And I know you are not a charitable organization. I know why you are in business. But has Goldman Sachs done anything to try to help these community banks and these homeowners who are struggling to make their mortgage payments?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, we have----"
"Senator McCain","I mean, you did get $10 billion of the taxpayers' money."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, we did, and I mentioned in my opening statement the disposition of that, the return, and the return with a high rate of return for the taxpayer, but we understand our obligations don't end there. We have always been a philanthropic organization. We don't tend to--again, we sometimes are invisible, but I would say in the last year, 2009, we allocated, and I don't mean just accrued, we delivered a billion dollars of the firm's funds to philanthropy, including $500 million to a program to support small businesses by giving education to small businesses through the medium and delivery mechanism of community colleges and with a view to providing finance for some of the graduates of the programs that we have for those small businessmen in order to make them bigger businessmen and to involve our people with it. Are any of these things enough? Not for the suffering existing in the world, but again, we are trying to do our part. We think in the main conduct of our business, we are also doing important things for the capital markets, but we do take account of communities and institutions that we normally don't reach as Goldman Sachs."
"Senator McCain","What about community banks? Any involvement with them?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We may help find--I just don't know."
"Senator McCain","Explain, perhaps for the benefit of the Subcommittee and for the record, what is a synthetic CDO?"
"Mr. Blankfein","A CDO----"
"Senator McCain","A synthetic CDO."
"Mr. Blankfein","I was going to build to it."
"Senator McCain","Sorry."
"Mr. Blankfein","A CDO is a pool of assets, in this case, mortgage assets, so mortgages that are pooled together and then can be sliced in a way that will yield a particular credit exposure. The reason why one would want to pool mortgages is it gives diversification so that you can pool mortgages not just from one community, but distribute it over the whole country. The reason why one would want to slice it is so you could pick your place on the credit spectrum and say, I would like the more senior mortgages. I would like the more junior risks. In a synthetic, you don't pool the actual mortgages per se. You pool reference securities that are indexed to specific pools of mortgages."
"Senator McCain","In other words, in a synthetic CDO, you don't really have any ownership. You are just betting on the fortunes of that CDO, is that correct?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. You are doing it in a way to get a specific risk in a specific place at a specific level of the spectrum without necessarily having to assemble the particular securities, and so you can do it more quickly and you can do it more precisely."
"Senator McCain","How does that differ from going out to Caesar's Palace to the sports book and making a wager on the outcome of an athletic event?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, I think the people who are participating in the synthetic CDO market are specifically trying to take particular risks with respect to the housing market, short or long, and presumably they want to take that to either initiate that exposure or to use that exposure to help hedge themselves or to adjust their risk profile, in the case of somebody who already has accumulated risk."
"Senator McCain","It has been alleged in the case of the Abacus----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Abacus."
"Senator McCain","Transaction that the credit rating agency was not informed that a hedge fund client was taking a short position. Is that true?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think the specific complaint was a lack of disclosure that a short--someone who was taking the short side of the position had an influence on the selection agent and that should have been disclosed."
"Senator McCain","Should it have been disclosed?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We don't think so, no, and that is in dispute."
"Senator McCain","The credit rating agency, the one that----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, it is complicated, because in the alternative, and again, this is a case, and in the alternative--and there is also some--and again, this is a litigation and obviously one side thinks one thing and another side thinks another--there is also a belief on our side that the selection agent did know, so----"
"Senator McCain","Let us assume that the agency didn't know. Is that--well, you would know whether you informed the rating agency or not, wouldn't you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I personally would not. The person, and he was here testifying, asserted that he believed the other side of the transaction did know and therein lies a factual dispute."
"Senator McCain","The rating agency would know whether they were told or not."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry, are we talking about the selection agent?"
"Senator McCain","The rating agency--the hedge fund--so there is a difference of opinion between the hedge fund client and Goldman?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't think there is a difference of opinion between the hedge fund client and Goldman."
"Senator McCain","Well, the rating agency rates the CDO, right?"
"Mr. Blankfein","A rating agency, yes, rates a CDO."
"Senator McCain","And it is alleged that the rating agency was not told that a hedge fund client was taking a short position."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, this may be a different point. This is not the subject of the legal proceeding, to the best of my knowledge."
"Senator McCain","Well, a lot of these things are fairly complicated, Mr. Blankfein, and a lot of Americans don't understand what happened, but they do understand that they are still hurting very badly, many of them across this country, and they believe that your handling and other financial institutions handling of the housing market and these complicated transactions were a direct contributor to the meltdown that America experienced and they haven't recovered. You have done pretty well. I don't think that is the vision that most Americans have of how this Nation and its economy should function. I thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator McCain."
"Senator Kaufman",""
"Senator Kaufman","Good afternoon."
"Mr. Blankfein","Good afternoon."
"Senator Kaufman","In your testimony, you say that Goldman has been ``a client-centered firm for 140 years.'' Clients come to the firm because, you say, ``one, they want financial advice; two, they need financing; three, they want to buy or sell a stock, bond, or other financial instrument; or four, they want the help in managing and growing their financial assets.''"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, sir."
"Senator Kaufman","Is it fair to say in the last 30 years that Goldman has focused more and more of its resources and gained more and more of its revenue from trading in its own account without the need for clients?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We have focused more and more in trading as a principal----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","But that is the way the client business has evolved, sir."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. But it has evolved away from the classic investment banking and gotten more and more to trading?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, I would say that, increasingly, and this is a change in the sociology of the business that took place over the last 15 or 20 years, I am not sure it was precipitated by the fall of Glass-Steagall or it caused Glass- Steagall to fall as U.S. institutions had to become more competitive with global institutions, but somewhere along the line, clients used to ask you for advice--if you were an investment bank and then went to other institutions and asked them for financing----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","And to take principal risk."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Somewhere along the line, they stopped asking necessarily to do things for them, but to do things with them, in other words, to be the other side. And today in the world, and this evolved over a long period of time, to be effective for your clients, you not only had to give them advice, but you had to have the financial wherewithal, in other words, the balance sheet to be able to accomplish their objectives, not just advise them on their objectives. And so Goldman Sachs, 12 or 13 years ago, actually had to reverse many years of being a private partnership and become a public partnership, public company, so we could, frankly, survive in the evolving world of needing to be a principal to accomplish our clients' objectives."
"Senator Kaufman","But also, it was very profitable. I mean, Goldman Sachs has clearly been one of the most profitable institutions on the face of this earth. So also, I mean, it wasn't just kind of the move of society. It was also a way, when you sat down and you had your meetings and everything else, you said, look, this is the way to go. And I am not saying that from a negative."
"Mr. Blankfein","I know, Senator, and I know you are not saying it negative, but just for the history of it----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","It was a very observed decision by the world of what Goldman Sachs was doing, done very reluctantly----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Not so much to--and the real rationale for it was not because to make incremental profits. It was done in order for us to survive as a leading financial institution. Had we not done it, had we not grown, if we were not effective for our clients in order to allow them to accomplish those objectives, I don't think--Goldman Sachs would be around, but it wouldn't be an important company today."
"Senator Kaufman","OK. We will just agree that--I think that you were one of the leaders in doing this. I mean, I am not saying it from a negative standpoint----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We were the last of the firms to do this."
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. And does proprietary trading activity ever run counter to the interest of your clients, do you think? Do you ever feel like it is a conflict of interest? I just think it is a conflict of interest, because one of the things that bothers me most about our society today is it is like when you say someone has a conflict of interest, it is like----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I understand."
"Senator Kaufman","You are accusing them of being crooked. I am not saying that. I am saying, but it seems to me that--does proprietary trading activity ever run counter to the interest of your clients, or present a conflict of interest, let me put it that way?"
"Mr. Blankfein","The fact that we are a principal--in other words, when you say proprietary, it means a business that is totally separate from our client business----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","In which no client is engaged."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I don't think so. We keep those--when we do proprietary trading, it is separate."
"Senator Kaufman","Oh, no, I know it is separate. I am not saying that----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Separate, and separate people----"
"Senator Kaufman","No. I know it is separate people. But your firm--I am not saying anybody is doing anything wrong----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I know you are not----"
"Senator Kaufman","I am saying that Jones over in Department A is talking to Smith over in Department B. But if Jones is doing one thing and Smith is doing something else, there is potential for a conflict of interest. Now, you say, I resolve that conflict of interest by saying, Jones, you can't talk to Smith. But when you are doing out of one firm these kind of transactions, there is a conflict of interest. Whether you handle it well, whether you have a wall down through the middle of Goldman Sachs or not, it just seems to me that it is just-- when you are trading for your own account, the potential for conflict of interest, as opposed to your clients, is just great."
"Mr. Blankfein","I think there are a lot--I think in our principal activities, which is more than our proprietary activities----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","For example, I think there is always that potential we have to manage. I think David Viniar said we always have to manage conflicts----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Because necessarily, if you are a principal----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","You are on the other side. I think our proprietary businesses actually have much less, although the perception of it--obviously, if you are asking the question, the perception of conflicts, but we keep those very separate."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. And all I am trying to do is get at the fact that this is a business where there is conflict of interest where there didn't used to be. I mean, when you were 100 percent behind your clients, you weren't involved in much proprietary trading for your own account. You could just worry about your client. But inherent in this is risk of conflict. How you deal with it, I am not saying, but just the fact the conflict exists. Now, to go back to what Chairman Levin does, just to go through it one more time, in the first half of 2007, Goldman Sachs sold long positions in CDOs to its clients, right?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Two-thousand-seven----"
"Senator Kaufman","The first half of 2007."
"Mr. Blankfein","We sold--we reduced our risk, which since the risk largely started out as long, it means we sold some of our long positions and put on other short positions."
"Senator Kaufman","Right. So you sold positions, and while-- CDOs that Goldman itself had created and marketed while simultaneously taking short positions in the CDOs in order to limit your risk."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. You said that quickly."
"Senator Kaufman","You were selling CDOs at the same time you were taking short positions on the same CDOs. There is a thing called the Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, supposedly where specifically you were selling CDOs in the marketplace and at the same time, for your own account, you were selling the same CDOs short."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. I don't have any knowledge of that----"
"Senator Kaufman","But you believe that could happen?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I believe that we can have--that some people can own--look, on the first day, somebody could buy a CDO from us----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right, and then you could sell it short."
"Mr. Blankfein","And, yes, we could. On the first day, we could sell more--if people came to us for a market the day after we sold our whole inventory and wanted to buy it, we would short----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, but I think in this case, I mean, just to get back to specifics, you were selling CDOs as part of a marketing plan, you had bundled together these mortgages and you were selling them as CDOs and you were doing that on a regular basis through 2006, 2007. And then at some point, as Mr. Viniar pointed out, you decided that--in this whole area that you had risk and therefore you started selling CDOs short in order to solve this risk."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. I can't answer--I am not--I know that we reduced our risk as per the instruction. The risk started out long. I just don't know to what extent, how much was it selling length, which was some of it, for sure, selling certain securities, shorting certain securities, but I can't tell you, because some of it was, I think, the new ABX index, also. I just don't know."
"Senator Kaufman","Well----"
"Mr. Blankfein","But I know the----"
"Senator Kaufman","But you don't think--I mean, we established with Senator Levin, you don't think there is anything wrong with that."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't."
"Senator Kaufman","No."
"Mr. Blankfein","But I am also, to the extent you are asking me about whether we were long or short a specific security and in what proportion, I just don't know."
"Senator Kaufman","But you don't rule out the possibility that could have happened?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I can't rule it out. I just don't know."
"Senator Kaufman","So to get back to--and I am not going to ask you 20 times. I am just going to ask you once. Does that have the appearance of a conflict of interest?"
"Mr. Blankfein","That we were short----"
"Senator Kaufman","That you were selling CDOs--trust me, according to this Mezzanine, you were doing it. Hudson Mezzanine 2006-1, you basically packaged CDOs, sold them, and then at some point, I think, based on what Mr. Viniar said, you were concerned about this and you decided to short, in other words, in order to offset it, the risk, to cut back your risk. And I am just saying, don't you think that has the appearance of a conflict?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I don't know. If we have pools of securities in our inventory----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","And we are trying to reduce our risk----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","We are going to be selling those----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Some combination of selling those, selling indexes, or selling other----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, but we talked about this with the last panel. You weren't here, but the last panel, we talked about this, and we decided that you did not want to sell those. We said, look, what most people do who aren't as sophisticated as Goldman Sachs, if they are in a position where you have a lot of stock or CDOs or bonds that you now think may be risky, you don't short something. People do short things, and there is nothing wrong with shorting things."
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator Kaufman","But most people cut back on their long, right? I mean, if they have 500 shares of stock they are starting to get concerned about, maybe they sell 100 shares. But the previous panel said that it was illiquid, that you didn't want to do that because of that. So what you did is you went out and Goldman Sachs actually sold short."
"Mr. Blankfein","May I speak generally----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","Not knowing about the specific security? The best way of reducing your risk is to sell what you have."
"Senator Kaufman","That is what I just said."
"Mr. Blankfein","Sometimes, as you said, you can't because it is illiquid."
"Senator Kaufman","Or you don't want to because of the liquid----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Or sometimes it is unattractive. But sometimes what people are doing is, gee, I am short something in this part of the capital structure----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","What I will do is I will sell something similar to it----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","But a little lower in quality-- "
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Because I think that will underperform against what I have."
"Senator Kaufman","No, I have got it. That is----"
"Mr. Blankfein","But that is what they are doing."
"Senator Kaufman","No, but that is not--I am talking about where you are actually out selling it, and this is what the concern is. I mean, in every other business--I think this is what the Chairman is getting at--in every other business for most Americans, if you were coming to me and saying--buy this car from me, and at the same time these are good cars, these things are great, but I just sold mine because I know it is a clunker--that is what the concern is, and let me tell you why this is so important and why your oil analogy really doesn't work. Because what is really at the heart of this is at what point did Goldman Sachs decide the housing market is going south and we want to get out of it? That is really at the heart. This isn't like you were carrying this oil deal that you talked about there. This is specifically we are now in 2007 and people were starting to see this market is bad, and guess what, Goldman Sachs sells a lot of stuff short, and guess what, they make a lot of money on it, but it is just a business deal. Do you see where the concern is?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Kaufman","It is like, at what point do--it is like the old Watergate thing. What did you know and when did you know it?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator----"
"Senator Kaufman","I mean, the key thing to this thing is, if you were still selling securities, mortgage-backed securities, RMBSs, residential mortgage-backed securities, after you really had decided that this was a down market and were evidenced by selling short, I think that is what people are wondering about."
"Mr. Blankfein","No, Senator, I realize that, and we are very much informed and we wouldn't be here but for the fact that there was such a collapse in the housing market. To go back to that oil analogy that I gave you, if we were sitting here and we had underwritten a new security like that, what we described to you instead of housing, and after we put it in the market, 3 months later----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","We were short that security in connection with our market making----"
"Senator Kaufman","That is OK because you are not continuing to sell those securities at the same time and you may be in a legitimate position."
"Mr. Blankfein","But it was the same security that we had underwritten----"
"Senator Kaufman","No, I understand that, but----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Three months earlier."
"Senator Kaufman","You had underwritten it, but the world has changed. I don't think people have a problem with you actually selling--I sell a series of securities, and then later on I see--let us say I sold out every one of them, and then 6 months later, I sell them short. I don't think anybody has a problem with that. That is it. Things happen. You sold it at the best time you knew what was going on. There is nothing inherently wrong with that. What is inherently wrong is if you start selling securities, a series of securities, and then at some point you decide, these are really bombs. I mean, we heard earlier about the fact that you were selling Washington Mutual, Long Beach securities, 90 percent of which were stated income loans. Ninety percent were stated income loans, home equity loans were stated income loans, and they all went bad. So, I mean, at some point somebody looks up and says--I just found out. We have been selling Long Beach securities. They are in our originator things and they have got all these stated income loans. We had better get out of this business. That is where the concern is. At what point did you know that? And here is the thing. Can I ask you really a----"
"Mr. Blankfein","May I ask----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","You asked me what we knew----"
"Senator Kaufman","Yes. What did you know when?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We did not know what subsequently occurred-- "
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","In the housing market."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","We did not know. By the way, we didn't behave like we knew it. In other words, there are emails going around where this one was nervous and this one really--and we are talking about relatively junior people in managing positions on desks----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","And then there are other emails where people were excited and thought the market would rebound."
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","We did not know that the housing market was going to happen like that."
"Senator Kaufman","At what point--I guess this is the----"
"Mr. Blankfein","And by the way, our positions reflect that, because had we known----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","We would have been massively short the market instead of just getting short----"
"Senator Kaufman","Can you tell me--I guess this is the real question----"
"Mr. Blankfein","About equal to what our longs were, and maybe a bit more."
"Senator Kaufman","We have heard from everybody, and I think it is totally credible until you ask the question, at what point--can you remember--I think it would be a pretty important day--that you decided to pull together the management of Goldman Sachs and say, what? This housing market is a bad place to be in. When was that day?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I never did."
"Senator Kaufman","You mean, right up until the end, nobody-- you didn't have as corporate policy that we should reduce our holdings in mortgage-backed securities and----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Oh, no----"
"Senator Kaufman","We should stop selling mortgage- backed securities. These things are just literally-- the whole market is coming apart. I mean, there had to be a time. I mean, it wasn't last week."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know that we--again, we are dealing with the same information. I think tomorrow--if tomorrow----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Tomorrow, I think there needs to be a--I think it would serve the public interest for a securities market in housing--again, learning from the mistakes----"
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Revealed, in other words, if you assume with me that we learned from all the mistakes, I think securitizing home mortgages is not inherently a bad activity."
"Senator Kaufman","No. I mean, at which point did you decide that this specific, that Goldman Sachs had to do everything it could to get out of this business, reduce your----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We never decided to get out of the business."
"Senator Kaufman","Well, how about the second quarter of 2007. You shut down your CDO warehouses. You took significant mark to market losses. You reduced loan purchase and reduced counterparty exposure. That sounds to me like you wanted to get out of that business."
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, to the best of my knowledge--again, and I am not close to that decision. There were other people. I don't know that a decision was made to leave that business as opposed to reduce the risks of the business----"
"Senator Kaufman","Shut down CDO warehouses? That wasn't an indication you wanted to get out of that business?"
"Mr. Blankfein","When you tell me, get out of the business, Senator, I don't know if--I don't know what that means."
"Senator Kaufman","But you can see why people were concerned about what went on in the second quarter of 2007, what was going on at this time. At what point did it reach a point where you are saying, I just can't sell this stuff anymore. It is just not right to continue to originate these loans. I mean, I just find it incredibly hard to believe. I mean, there is this illusion in this country, I guess, about how smart people are on Wall Street, and the people on Wall Street, and I know people going to Wall Street are really smart. And it is just hard for me to believe, and it is hard for the American people to believe that people this smart really never kind of decided that this thing was going south in a big way."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I heard your earlier remarks, as well. I think we are not that smart at--and maybe there were people who knew--and, by the way, even the people who with hindsight knew it, I think they thought it and then they turned out to be right."
"Senator Kaufman","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","I could tell you from my own self----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","At 20 percent down in the housing market, I didn't know whether it would go down 30 percent or rebound up 10 percent."
"Senator Kaufman","Well, even now is a different story. I believe----"
"Mr. Blankfein","But now----"
"Senator Kaufman","Because everybody--the problem is--the reason this is a problem is because one of the defenses you use is that these are all big boys, that we are dealing with the big boys and therefore, caveat emptor really doesn't apply. So big boys knew. And I am just saying, at what point--right now, big boys know that the housing market is a bad deal. You can get into the housing market now, but you are going to ask for one heck of a lot better documentation on what you are getting. You are going to ask for higher returns. You are going to ask for all kinds of things because you know that this is a very risky business. But the real question is that we have talked to Washington Mutual. We went through what they went through. They were just pushing stuff out the door as fast as they could get it. It didn't matter, stated income loans. We talked to the regulators. The regulators just basically--the head of Office of Thrift Supervision said he had no idea that Washington Mutual, 90 percent of their equity loans were stated income loans and 53 percent of the Option ARMs and so on. He had no idea of that, which he had previously said stated income loans are an anathema to the business. Then we go to the rating agencies. In 2003 to 2005, they were still saying, there is no problem--there is a problem. They were saying, there is a problem here. And you ask them, well, why in the thousands of RMBSs that they rated during 2006 and 2007 they rated 50 percent of them AAA and they are all now junk. So nobody knew? People were still doing things long after they knew there was a problem."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, there were a lot of business judgments, and maybe--I wish I had known, but if you just look at all the big Wall Street firms that lost tens of billions of dollars even after this period, in 2008----"
"Senator Kaufman","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","Holding on to these securities. I did not know. All we know is the discipline of mark to market and reducing our risk when the markets are nervous and when P&Ls are moving."
"Senator Kaufman","Let me just finish with this thought. This is the worst thing to happen to this country economically since the Great Depression. Millions of people were put out of work. Millions of people lost their homes. Millions of people are really hurting. And I think what really bothers people the most, at least the people I talk to, is not, the bailouts, although that bothers people a lot. I think what bothers them a lot is the incredible compensation. That bothers them, the bonuses to people that during 2006, 2007 made horrible decisions but still received gigantic performance bonuses, especially from CEOs and executives who said this should be based on performance, and the performance was lousy and still they made billions of dollars. But I think what really kind of gets them the most is here we are after this terrible travail and there is only one section of our entire economy that has to worry what it is going to do with billions of dollars for bonuses. That is the part. The fact that--and it may be totally a chance. It may be totally something beyond our control. But the idea that Wall Street came out of this thing just fine, thank you, is just something that just grates on people. And I think they think that you didn't just come out fine because it was luck. They think that you guys just really gamed this thing real, real well. Not that you caused the whole thing, although I would say you were a big part of the cause, but just that you came out of this thing fine. I think that is what disturbs them. So I think that is basically the point I was making. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator Kaufman. Dr. Coburn."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you, Mr. Blankfein, for being here. I have to disagree a little bit with Senator Kaufman. I think 90 percent of the problems associated with the meltdown in our mortgage system and the financial crisis sits on the lap of Congress. I have been adamant in my view on that because you can't record the last time we had an oversight hearing until the problems came up. We don't do oversight in advance to see whether things are working. Having said that, I have a few questions for you, Mr. Blankfein. The activities that you and your employees have been called here today to testify about, is it your understanding that your competitors were engaged in similar activities?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, and to a greater extent than us in most cases."
"Senator Coburn","Some of them aren't here anymore, are they?"
"Mr. Blankfein","That is correct."
"Senator Coburn","All right. Did you at any time have concerns--legal, ethical, or reputational--about any of the activities undertaken by Goldman employees about which we have heard today?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I did not."
"Senator Coburn","So you have not heard anything today----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Oh, I am sorry----"
"Senator Coburn","That has concerned you about actions or statements by Goldman or former Goldman employees?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think as I heard it, everything sounds correct. But when you say concerns, I mean, I am in the business--in my role, I will look deeply into everything that has surfaced here. What is going on in this hearing today is, of course, fact finding for you, but it is fact finding for everyone. So I heard nothing today that makes me think anything went wrong, but I won't--you raised transactions that I never heard of before and I will have people look deeply into them."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you. On Sunday, September 21, you made the following public statement about Goldman Sachs----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry, what date?"
"Senator Coburn","Sunday, September 21, 2008, about Goldman Sachs becoming a bank holding company. ``While accelerated by market sentiment, our decision to be regulated by the Federal Reserve is based on recognition that such regulation provides its members with full prudential supervision and access to permanent liquidity and funding. We believe that Goldman Sachs under Federal Reserve supervision will be regarded as an even more secure institution with an exceptionally clean balance sheet and a greater diversity of funding sources.'' Prior to September 2008, did you or anyone at Goldman Sachs have plans to convert the firm to a bank holding company?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Prior to September 21?"
"Senator Coburn","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","We had--yes. We didn't resolve to do it, but it was something that we were very much looking at."
"Senator Coburn","Was this something that was discussed at a Board meeting?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, it was."
"Senator Coburn","All right. And there are records of that Board meeting?"
"Mr. Blankfein","There must be. I haven't reviewed the records."
"Senator Coburn","Would you have your staff provide that to us?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator Coburn","If you would, please."
"Mr. Blankfein","It was decided at that Board meeting not to do it."
"Senator Coburn","Looking back today, would you rather be an investment bank?"
"Mr. Blankfein","You mean outside----"
"Senator Coburn","And not----"
"Mr. Blankfein","You mean not a bank holding----"
"Senator Coburn","Rather not be under the Federal Reserve today?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not sure how realistic--we will have to wait and see how the legislation unfolds. I am really not sure, and I will say it this way, how realistic that will be. The reason why we were looking at it at the time was it was hard to--we originally started with a whole regime for investment banks and then post-Bear Stearns and certainly post-Lehman, I think there was, at that point, it was clear there was not going to be a whole regime for----"
"Senator Coburn","For the classical investment bank."
"Mr. Blankfein","For the classical investment bank at that point, because there weren't that many."
"Senator Coburn","I think in your September 21, 2008 statement, you talked about access to permanent liquidity and a greater diversity of funding sources. Were you, in fact, referring to Goldman Sachs would be able to obtain access to the discount window at the Federal Reserve?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not sure. I think possibly. I am just not sure."
"Senator Coburn","Well, that would make sense to you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","It would make sense to me, but I am just not sure. I know there were a lot of facilities that were in place already, and I am not sure--I am just not sure."
"Senator Coburn","Let me ask a follow-up question. Prior to September 22, 2008, is it accurate to say that Goldman Sachs had temporary access to the discount window?"
"Mr. Blankfein","There are people, other people, even people here who might know that answer better than me. I know that we had access to certain funding facilities. I am not sure it was the discount window per se. I don't think so, but I am not sure."
"Senator Coburn","Well, that would be something that I would be interested in having----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, sir."
"Senator Coburn","Whether you did or didn't. Have you since becoming a bank holding company accessed the discount window?"
"Mr. Blankfein","To the best of my belief, other than to test it shortly after we became it, just to see if it would work, I would say no. But as you will notice, I am looking for confirmation from my CFO----"
"Senator Coburn","I understand. That is fair."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I feel much better having gotten it. No."
"Senator Coburn","Let me ask you a few questions about the bill that is being proposed. Your Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer said you embrace it. You are generally supportive of the Dodd bill. You have been fairly high profile in your support for it. Do you still maintain that support for this bill? Do you think it solves the problems that caused the problems that we got into?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think execution--well, first of all, some aspects of the bill, I think, have morphed over the last--maybe even over the last few days. I am not sure----"
"Senator Coburn","I don't think so. The vote was turned down."
"Mr. Blankfein","I see."
"Senator Coburn","I don't think we have gotten there."
"Mr. Blankfein","Right. I am generally supportive, and to be sure, there are details of it that I think I am less sure of. But I think, on the whole, financial reform is essential and I will say that last week in New York, I listened to a speech by Barack Obama at Wall Street and one of the points he made resonated with me because I had said it myself. He said that the biggest beneficiaries of reform will be Wall Street itself, because proper reform will make the markets safer, and then I will add my own piece, the biggest risks that financial institutions have are with each other. And so to the extent that is all made safer, I think America will be a big beneficiary, but specifically we will, as well."
"Senator Coburn","What do you think will happen to loan origination from the community banks and smaller regional banks if they are required to maintain 5 percent of every mortgage that they write? What do you think is going to happen to mortgage volume? Let us say the housing industry comes back. Do you think the small banks are going to be writing mortgages anymore in the future?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not--I think I should give a qualification to my--there are parts of that bill that we will--that affect us and that we have particular expertise and experience in, and that is really what I was addressing. There are other big parts of that bill that are just remote from our experience. How it affects community banks, how it affects mortgage originators, since we are only in that business in a de minimis way, and how it affects consumer banks, consumer legislation being a major part of it, is really remote from our experience because we don't engage in those activities. So I should give you that qualification."
"Senator Coburn","Do you have any thoughts on the fact that this bill doesn't address underlying core problems like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think----"
"Senator Coburn","I mean, you would agree that there was an incentive to make loans through the implicit guarantee of the Federal Government to people were less qualified than what we had seen prior to the onset of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac."
"Mr. Blankfein","I can't speak to the qualifications or standards of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. I can say that they were an instrument of policy to attract more money into home ownership, which is--I am not suggesting that is--but that is what they accomplished."
"Senator Coburn","But you would agree with an implicit Federal guarantee on a mortgage, that would make it more available to more people, because the cost of capital would go down----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","Because of an implicit Federal guarantee behind it."
"Mr. Blankfein","I would say there are two, and there may be a lot more, but coming to mind, there are two big policy facts that tend to draw more money into housing, at least two, one of which is that through the government-sponsored entities, money--the government implicitly--those entities were able to draw in money because they were perceived to be quasi- government credits. That is one. And the other is, of course, the fact that the tax code allows you to deduct mortgage interest. And so those two things would cause--would favor more money, all other things being equal, to flow into those sectors."
"Senator Coburn","Have you personally spoken with anybody at Treasury about the regulatory reform effort?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Since the beginning?"
"Senator Coburn","Have you had----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I might have."
"Senator Coburn","Let me rephrase the question. Have you in the last 6 to 9 months had conversations with people at Treasury about the regulatory reform effort?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I might have, but they were--they would be at a very general and high level, not specific, frankly, along the lines in which I am--the same way I am talking about it to you, at the same----"
"Senator Coburn","OK. That is fair. Do you know who you talked to?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I call, as part of what I do in my role, I try to see senior people in Treasury and at the White House and, frankly, in the legislature and introduce myself, offer to discuss things on their mind and offer them things, if they are interested in hearing it that are on my mind. But they are generally--but I wasn't involved in any kind of roll-up-your- sleeve effort on specific points."
"Senator Coburn","Let me change course for a minute. I just really want to pick your brain and your judgment."
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator Coburn","Systemic risk and the fact that it was there created the necessary program for us to eliminate that systemic risk. The option in the Dodd bill is to tax you so that we can have a fund, and I have real problems with how that fund is managed, but the idea is, is so that the government doesn't ever loan it again, i.e., the taxpayer, but, in fact, the taxpayer will, because if you are taxed, it is going to cost more to the people you do business with. So what are the other ways to handle systemic risk, in your opinion, that are different than creating a taxpayer-funded fund again that would limit this country's exposure to significant systemic risk, knowing that as we lessen that risk, we probably also lessen some of our competitive capability worldwide in terms of financial and capital markets?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, I think for sure we need the apparatus--it could very well be the apparatus proposed--for systemic risk regulation and observing systems and people who can look across all the different institutions and potential sources of systemic risk. I think that is very important. Second, and I think possibly the most important thing that is being discussed, is to recognize that despite every good intention, despite trying to see around every corner, you just will miss stuff, and to make sure that the system is better able to absorb the consequence of missing something. And so making financial institutions, including institutions like ourselves, have appropriate levels of capital and liquidity, which by and large means more of both----"
"Senator Coburn","Which means we would limit your leverage ratio to 10 to 12?"
"Mr. Blankfein","You might limit our leverage ratio. You might have us have certain kinds of contingent securities that cause people to have to give us money at times we need it. There are a number of proposals out to do it, but in general, the system would be made safer if financial institutions had more capital. There is, of course, a cost for this, because to the extent that you have more capital and lower leverage, loans will be more expensive. There will be less credit granted, but that is a tradeoff that after the experience of the last few years policy makers may well be interested in making, and it is a question of degree that----"
"Senator Coburn","Well, it is about a $10 trillion cost of what we have absorbed already, so----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Right."
"Senator Coburn","That may be cheap in comparison to what we have swallowed."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I think at least a third level, after you try to avoid all the problems and after you try to have more capital to absorb the problems, you have to have a resolution authority to make sure if No. 1 and No. 2 don't work, that an individual institution that was poorly run or undercapitalized doesn't bring down the system, and so no institution should be too big to fail or have to burden the public with the cost of its failure or being saved."
"Senator Coburn","Which brings to mind, do you think that the FDIC presently has the capable staff that would be able to come in and run Goldman Sachs if you got into trouble?"
"Mr. Blankfein","My answer----"
"Senator Coburn","The answer to that is absolutely no. Nobody is going to believe they have the capability to do that. But that is what we are setting up in this bill. We are going to give them broad power to come in. They will pick winners and losers. They will make the decisions. They have none of the expertise to do that, but that is who we are going to put this with."
"Mr. Blankfein","I can't answer your question. My experience with the FDIC, while limited, because as we started out in the beginning of this conversation, we have only been a bank for a short period of time, has been--makes me respect them to quite a great degree, but it has been in connection with their existing functions."
"Senator Coburn","Yes, but their existing function is they take over and immediately sell the assets and they don't run things, correct? And this bill is going to have them running things, a big difference. There is no question they do a good job when they close and sell the assets and open it up--close it on Friday and open it on Monday. But there are experienced people in the banking business that are making the decisions on that, not FDIC----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","And they have nobody near the capability of people inside Goldman to take over Goldman and run it, yet that is what we are writing into the bill. And you think that is a wise position?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not sure of the interaction of that. Senator, one thing I would say----"
"Senator Coburn","Well, no, the interaction is we are going to give a Federal bureaucracy the ability--who has never had any experience--to come in and run a company like Goldman Sachs, one of the most sophisticated financial institutions the world has ever known, they have no experience, no knowledge with how to do that, and we are going to write law and then they are going to write regulations that they are going to be able to do that, if you become too big to fail or you become a systemic risk for the rest of the financial institution. Do you all embrace that? I mean, that is totally different than anything we have heard from Goldman Sachs' business philosophy here today and what we have studied."
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I don't know how that interacts and I don't know the rules and I don't know how they will be applied in the details of the regulations, and the devil, of course, is always in the details----"
"Senator Coburn","But yet you all embrace the bill?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I said we support the direction of the bill, but with respect to this, I think it is very important for Goldman Sachs and I think it is very important for taxpayers, but let me come back and say this first--it is important for Goldman Sachs that we take away the notion that this is a very big burden on us if people think we are too big to fail. We don't think we are too big to fail. We don't want to be too big to fail. But a lot of the negativity that is associated with us is because people think we are getting the benefit of being too big to fail, and I don't think it is good for the country or for us to be in that place."
"Senator Coburn","Well, you would agree that $700 billion got allocated of taxpayer money to solve systemic risk problems, of which you were the beneficiary both directly and indirectly of a portion of that."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Coburn","So somebody thought you were too big to fail."
"Mr. Blankfein","Certainly at that time--the answer is, yes. At that time, even a small institution might have been too big to fail, just because of the fragility. There was so much tinder----"
"Senator Coburn","That is a legitimate point."
"Mr. Blankfein","So I would think----"
"Senator Coburn","What about the idea of taking the six largest banks that do similar things to you and make them into 60 with specialization in this over here, and this over here-- "
"Mr. Blankfein","I thought about that----"
"Senator Coburn","Where we divide up systemic risk so we don't have systemic risk?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I thought of that. I don't think that would be a good idea, and I am speaking, Senator, from a position of not being really one of those big banks. In other words, our balance sheet of something over $800 billion, I think is about a third or 40 percent of where the big banks are. So even though we are a big investment bank, because we don't do all those--we are not----"
"Senator Coburn","You don't do the commercial side, and you don't do----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We are not as big as those and don't have the balance sheet. But notwithstanding that we are one of the smaller ones, I would say there is a lot of--obviously, if someone is going to get to that position of failing, the fact that they are big makes it worse. But the fact that banks are bigger and more diverse and more activities in more places in the world probably makes them safer. And second, when you think of the big financing purposes in the world and what the United States needs to maintain its competitiveness, having financial institutions too small to conduct financing and a competitive basis as the rest of the world, I think will be a competitive disadvantage to the United States."
"Senator Coburn","OK. I have one final question. You are the leader of Goldman Sachs. There is no question about that, right?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, sir."
"Senator Coburn","All right. And you set the tone?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I do, sir."
"Senator Coburn","I have asked a lot of questions about ethics today throughout the period. I have a question for you. Why did Goldman Sachs decide to release the personal emails of Mr. Tourre and not everybody else in this hearing? It had no investigative purpose. We didn't expose any of that. We had deleted all of it. We weren't exposing it. Was that a right decision? And, is it fair to your employee? Is that a political ploy or a defense ploy, or why would you do that to one of your own employees?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I wasn't close to the decision, but can I give you--I wasn't specific about that, but I think what we have been--we wanted to get, and I wasn't thinking about that because we also put--we also provided some information from emails with respect to the business and these--there were elements here that were--spoke badly of the firm and we just wanted to come abreast of all the issues about which were bad to the firm. There was nothing in anything, to my understanding, about Mr. Tourre's subsequent emails that weren't evidenced by the emails that had already been out. And so I didn't think we were adding anything to distress----"
"Senator Coburn","Well, this Subcommittee had never released any of that information on him, anything that would get into his personal life or his personal thoughts. To me, I go back to the original question. The tone set by that, if I worked for Goldman Sachs, I would be real worried that somebody has made a decision that he is going to be a whipping boy. He is the guy that is getting hung out to dry, because nobody else had their personal emails released. You all made a very distinct, discriminatory decision that one of your employees is going to be made to look bad, because we didn't release those emails."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I don't know what it was, but there were emails that were extant and--again, this is all to the best of my knowledge----"
"Senator Coburn","I understand that. And maybe you weren't involved in it----"
"Mr. Blankfein","And I think what we wanted to do with respect to some of the issues was to just get information--get it out so that we could deal with it, because at this point, and I think you are aware that the press was just very--and maybe the press--I don't know where they came from, but I don't think we added, to the best of my knowledge, but I don't know, I don't think we added to the state of knowledge about those emails which our employee addressed, and I think needed to address."
"Senator Coburn","Thank you. I have gone over my time, Mr. Chairman. I apologize. Mr. Blankfein, thank you for your cooperation."
"Senator Levin","Thank you. Senator McCaskill."
"Senator McCaskill","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Mr. Blankfein for being here today."
"Mr. Blankfein","Thank you, Senator."
"Senator McCaskill","I want to start by saying that in many ways, the focus on just your firm is tremendously unfair. The activities that are being talked about, and I am sure we could compile the same kind of documents, the same kind of emails from all of your competitors on Wall Street. I mean, the conduct that we are looking at was not exclusive to Goldman Sachs and I think it is important to acknowledge that on the record. In fairness, there probably ought to be another four or five CEOs sitting up there with you, as we discussed----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I would welcome the company."
"Senator McCaskill","I am sure you would. And I know it seems like we are harping, but it is because so many of the cultural realities of what you all do is jarring to most Americans. This notion of selling a product that you are betting against is hard for people to understand that just have a basic sense of right and wrong and common sense. And we spent a lot of time going over that today. I want to talk about several details as it relates to that. One is that it is clear to me that you all had--there was kind of an orphan document in the documents that we got, and one of the orphan documents we got was from a woman named Manisha Nanik to a person named Loren Morris. And what it was was a summary of an analysis of mortgages that you all were going to slice and dice and do all the tranches. And it is a fairly detailed finding, and it is important, the date on this document is March 13, 2007. This is Exhibit 77.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 77, which appears in the Appendix on page 504.  This document says that 7 percent of the mortgages that the Goldman employee looked at had material occupancy misrepresentations, where borrowers took anywhere from 4 to 14 loans at a time and defaulted on all. You risk in the loan performance and difficulty foreclosing on the second liens would be potentially unsecured. Another 20 percent of the pool had material compliance issues. They are mainly missing final HUDs. We cannot put these loans back. We will need to consider option of our service or fixing the errors via refinance, refund, or disclosure."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. Could you give me the number again?"
"Senator McCaskill","It is Exhibit 77."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. I apologize."
"Senator McCaskill","She goes on to say, approximately 10 percent of the pool is flagged as potential REO or potential unsecured or second lien. Another 5 percent of the pool was originally fraudulently based on the DD results. Main findings, possible ID theft, broker misrepresentation, straw buyer, falsification of information origination documents. And then she says, there is a reputation headline risk, as well. Now, I am not sure if these--you did issue a bunch of New Century mortgages at or around that time in a CDO, in one of these instruments. I can't say that these are the ones that you issued, but what it tells me is you had internal analysis on these mortgages."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I don't know whether--I am reading the words. I don't know who these people are. It sounds like, just looking at it, it sounds like somebody is complaining and asking--recommending that we not do some of these things, from what I can see on this page."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, I think it is plain on its face that this is a Goldman Sachs employee that has analyzed a group of mortgages that you all were considering packaging up----"
"Mr. Blankfein","But I don't know----"
"Senator McCaskill","Either for somebody to bet on or bet against."
"Mr. Blankfein","But I don't know whether any of this was--I don't know who these people are and I don't know whether any of this was done."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, here is what I----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Are you saying that we did these?"
"Senator McCaskill","This is your document. This came from you----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I know it is a document----"
"Senator McCaskill","It is a Goldman Sachs document. I don't know whether you did these or not. The point I am trying to make is it shows that an analysis was going on on the mortgages that went into your instruments internally."
"Mr. Blankfein","There better have been. I think we are supposed to analyze and do due diligence with respect to securities and instruments that are created."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Well, if that is the case, then when you issued all the documents that you did when you did all the--what is the name of the company that had all of the problems--Long Beach Mortgage. When you did all the Long Beach Mortgage, do you think you did this same analysis on all the Long Beach mortgages?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know specifically about Long Beach. I know we have, in all our businesses, due diligence processes that are appropriate for the business. So I would say as a matter of process, I would assume appropriate due diligence was done on it, based on our standards and our protocols."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, in May 2006, you were the co-lead underwriter with WaMu to securitize about 532 in subprime second lien fixed rate mortgages originated by Long Beach. Now, keep in mind that this is the same Long Beach that had to buy back hundreds of millions of dollars of mortgages because of problems. At one point in time a few years earlier, they had been shut down because of problems. And I guess I would like to request, on behalf of the Subcommittee, that we see the analysis, first of all, that we figure out what mortgages these were that were analyzed, where you found fraud and you found 5 percent fraud, 7 percent material occupancy misrepresentation, 20 percent material compliance issues. I think it would be important for us to see those documents on the instruments you created for folks to take a side on."
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. I am not sure whether an instrument was created out of this, but I get the point and will look for it."
"Senator McCaskill","Yes. I mean, I think the point is that it is hard for us to believe that if you all were doing the due diligence that you have stated a couple of times in your testimony, now we know that these things were full of this kind of stuff. We know that. And you obviously knew it on one instance because we have a document from somebody in your employ that 38 percent of the loans are out of tolerance. I recommend putting back 26 percent of the pool, if possible. It doesn't make me comfortable that you all, after doing the due diligence, actually disclosed as much as you maybe should have disclosed about some of the problematic paper that you were packaging up for investors, and so I would like to follow that trail and get the same kind of documents on the instruments that you did put out in the market, both in 2006, "
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator McCaskill","OK. Let me ask you this. And by the way, in May 2006, right about when you did that, Office of Thrift Supervision just did a scoop at Long Beach and found all kinds of problems with their mortgages, almost at the exact time you were putting your instrument out. So that is why I question what kind of due diligence was actually going on and how much due diligence you were actually using in telling the buying public what was in these various transactions. In your testimony, you expressed regret that Goldman missed the signs of a system where credit was too easy, and you have said nobody could know when the housing market would crash or how bad it would crash. Looking back, do you think that you all did enough to look at what were in these instruments and how strong they were on their face? Do you think you exposed the kind of problems that these loans, the vast majority of these loans, represented?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Given that things didn't work out well, in hindsight, I wish we had done more. I think we thought at the time, and again, I don't have contemporaneous knowledge of it and I am not an expert on that area, I believe we believed we were doing appropriate due diligence and appropriate disclosure. Things went much further and got much worse than people realized. I don't know that we would have--I wish we had done--I don't know what due diligence would have picked that up, but I wish we had done more to get there."
"Senator McCaskill","Would more disclosure, in fact, harm your business model?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't----"
"Senator McCaskill","If you truly are just the house, if you truly are just trying to manage transactions on both sides of a proposition?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't think so."
"Senator McCaskill","And it is interesting to me that the investment banks that have created all these exotic instruments, that there has not been more effort to push for more disclosure, that it appears that we are dragging you along kicking and screaming. Is that an unfair characterization?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know. I am not sure what----"
"Senator McCaskill","There is no question that sometime in early 2007, you realized that there was a lot of--you had a lot of residual positions, equity residual positions on these CDOs and that you wanted those books cleaned up as quickly as possible."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am thinking in terms of risk. I am not sure they were equity residual--I am not sure. I don't know that I had formed a view of equity residual positions, per se."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, in Exhibit 130,\1\ there is an email from you to Tom Montag, and the email reads as follows. ``Tom, you refer to losses stemming from residual positions in old deals. Could/should we have cleaned up these books before and are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other books throughout the division.'' That was in February   \1\ See Exhibit No. 130, which appears in the Appendix on page 853. "
"Mr. Blankfein","I got to the page."
"Senator McCaskill","That would seem to be indicating that in early 2007, before you all had, in fact, marketed more of these synthetic CDOs, that you were basically saying, let us clean up the residual positions we have, the cats and dogs, and push them to traders."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I don't remember typing this, but I could tell you clearly how I used those words and what I meant. I hope I have this right, but when I use the expression ``cats and dogs,'' I mean miscellaneous stuff. I hope everybody thinks of it that way. That is how I use the words."
"Senator McCaskill","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I am referring--this is just my normal rant about aged inventory, just as a matter of risk management. When somebody tells me they are losing money on old stuff, my reaction is, why do you--part of the discipline of our business is to manage risk and sell inventory, and so here, I am not even thinking about the particular asset class he is talking about. I am saying, could/should we have cleaned up these books--in other words, I am yelling at him--before, and are we doing enough right now to sell off cats and dogs in other books throughout the division? I am basically saying that you are head of the division. You are supposed to be managing an aged inventory--we have something called aged inventory, which is just as a matter of discipline, let us not accumulate residuals, parts of other deals. Sometimes we have little pieces left over, but those little pieces, if you don't pay--they are not big enough to pay attention to, but in the aggregate can hurt you. So I am saying, I am just being----"
"Senator McCaskill","Well, I will just tell you, I won't take the time to read through the whole email chain, but it is clear if you read through the whole email chain, this whole email chain was about risk in the whole loan trading business, and it is clear that what was going on here is there was a lot of internal noise about the fact that you had long positions, equity positions in a lot of this stuff as you guys were moving--I think we have beaten this horse until it is almost dead--into some major short positions throughout 2007. As the Chairman said, in earlier questioning of other witnesses, as you all keep talking about your net for 2007, no one has been able to delineate specifically how much of the long position that you were suffering in 2007 is this really old stuff as opposed to any notion that you guys were actually participating in long purchases through 2007."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, it wouldn't matter to me one bit. If we had risk on our book, it wouldn't matter to me whether it was there for a long time or a short time. Risk is risk----"
"Senator McCaskill","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I would want them--if we would ask people to manage their risk down, they would manage their risk down. By the way, I found on the front page--I am sure I didn't look at this whole document--the fellow who wrote to me said, most of the risk is in old residual positions from deals done over the last few years, and that is what I was responding to."
"Senator McCaskill","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","In other words, a person--it is undisciplined to hold stuff because it is small for years. It just is probably because it was too small to pay attention to, and that is not the way you are supposed to be."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, I am not sure when you look at all the documents that the older long positions you had would be considered small by most people's standards, but maybe it would within the context of your organization."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, I am referring to most of the risk is in old residual positions. Anyway, that is what----"
"Senator McCaskill","And I guess what I am trying to get at is the point we have been trying to make, and this is where I think--this notion that you guys are market makers and you also are sometimes taking positions outside of your just market making, that is what is hard for many of us to kind of get our arms around. I guess, I have been talking sports analogies today because I think there is a lot about this that relates to gambling on a sporting event, because the synthetic CDOs didn't represent anything but gambling. It was folks taking one side or the other. It wasn't real mortgages in there. It was just stuff saying, take a bet, just like you bet on a football game. Is there anything that you would not create a market for if a client came to you to create a market? I understand that some people are trying to create a derivative market now in how movies are going to do."
"Mr. Blankfein","I haven't heard about or been involved in it. And I am sure there is, but if there is somebody who has-- and if somebody whose business depends on--would be able to do their business better if they were able to hedge or eliminate a financial risk and they came to us and asked us to eliminate that risk and it was legitimate, proper, and honest and susceptible to being understood, I think we would--they would come to us and ask to do it."
"Senator McCaskill","But didn't Mr. Paulson just want to make money because he thought the market was going to tank? He didn't have a--he just was looking for a place to score on a bet, wasn't he?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I can't say what Mr. Paulson is thinking, but there is nothing wrong--speculating--if he was, which I don't know what he was thinking, if he was just a speculator, there are people who speculate in corn and speculate in all sorts of commodities----"
"Senator McCaskill","I understand."
"Mr. Blankfein","That allow the professional users of those markets to complete their hedges. That is a socially acceptable----"
"Senator McCaskill","Mr. Blankfein, there is a big difference between finding the opposite side of a certainty in a commodity hedge for a farmer that needs certainty or an airline company that needs to figure out what jet fuel is going to cost and two sides of a deal that are both just betting. There is nothing in a synthetic CDO that is essential to certainty to anybody's business other than somebody just deciding they want to take one side of a deal and the other side of a deal. That is what a synthetic CDO is."
"Mr. Blankfein","Every futures contract on oil or anything consists of you could characterize it as a bet, but not the underlying commodity. Some of these things just don't even settle in physical form, but they provide the liquidity and the opportunity for people who want to hedge themselves to get in and take that position."
"Senator McCaskill","And we can't take this too far."
"Mr. Blankfein","Oh, for sure."
"Senator McCaskill","I mean, you don't think that there is a point where we make up stuff to bet on and you guys are securitizing it and tranching it, and especially the situation in this instance."
"Mr. Blankfein","Let me be clear----"
"Senator McCaskill","You put one side of the bet in the room with the people who are picking the product, which is, I think, bizarre. I guess your representatives this morning acted like it wasn't any big deal----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry, that what wasn't a big deal?"
"Senator McCaskill","That the person who came to you that wanted to bet against the deal, you put them in the room with the people who were going to pick the stuff in the deal. In other words, you didn't put both sides in there. You put one side of the bet in with the people who were picking the product that was going to be gambled on. That seems weird. You know what it reminds me of? It reminds me of this notion--I think most Americans think it would be really wrong for one of the football players to be able to be in the room with the bookie trying to influence what the line was going to be, and then they turn around and bet on the game they are playing in."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, Senator----"
"Senator McCaskill","That is what this feels like. It feels like that you guys are betting on the game you are playing in and that maybe it is not a level playing field."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, on these transactions, and I feel it--I know there is an inherent distaste for the short side of things as opposed to the long side of things. But for every transaction, there is a buyer and a seller and there is nothing immoral about somebody structuring a position--and by the way, some of the people who are taking the short position may just be wanting to restructure their portfolios, as well."
"Senator McCaskill","I understand that. But you understand that----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I do."
"Senator McCaskill","It feels like you guys were pushing a product that you were betting against at the same time you were letting somebody who wanted one side of the deal in the room with the people who were picking the product, not the other side of the deal. None of that seems like even- steven. None of that seems like you are an honest bookie who is trying to manage risk on both sides and just get it down to the vig."
"Mr. Blankfein","In that transaction, ACA, the selection agent, I think, was the buyer itself of something like 80 or 90 percent of the transaction. The biggest buyer, the biggest long in that whole transaction was ACA itself. I think it took a position of a total deal of around $1.1 billion. I think it took over $900 million of the transaction itself. So the biggest buyer of that transaction was very well represented. It was the selection agent itself."
"Senator McCaskill","Well, that also seems weird. I mean, it seems like to me that if you--and it is hard for me to believe that the selection agent was excited about that deal if they really knew the person who was helping them pick all the deals wanted to bet against it."
"Mr. Blankfein","The selection agent had engaged in a lot of these portfolios and was one of the biggest portfolio managers in that asset class. When we talk about investors and deals, it sounds like this is a broad distribution. There were only three professional investors engaged in the whole transaction. This was--in effect, there was no transaction--this was not a transaction that had to be done. This was a transaction that only worked if the longs and the shorts agreed on what the portfolio was. And I realize that is not intuitive, but those professional investors wanted those exposures."
"Senator McCaskill","And I am not sure that, frankly, it is a thing of value that most Americans would be comfortable that we would be backing up and providing taxpayer bailouts to companies that were engaging in that, especially if you weren't actually really dealing with a commodity or dealing with a product at the base of the transaction, that you were making up securitizations for people to, in fact, take positions on only for that reasons. It seems like hamsters in a cage trying to get to compensation as opposed to societal value that investment banks in this country, I think, have represented for many years. I really appreciate you being here today. I hope you stay at the table with us as we work on this legislation. I think, clearly, this hearing has shown in the work this Subcommittee has done, and the staff has done amazing work here, that we have conflict of interest issues, we have disclosure issues, and we have transparency issues, and we need to get all of those fixed to make sure we don't have a repeat of this debacle. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Levin","Thank you, Senator McCaskill. Senator Pryor."
"Senator Pryor","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to start, if I can, with the topic of asking you about credit rating agencies. In retrospect, how accurate were the credit rating agencies in rating the various tranches of CDOs?"
"Mr. Blankfein","In retrospect, they were inaccurate."
"Senator Pryor","And so, these got rated as AAA, and I know they were downgraded later, but why do you think that they missed the rating so bad?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think they never anticipated that the market could fall as much as the market fell. Again, this is not contemporaneous knowledge. This is not anything in depth; I know about the--I mean, I read articles, too, but it just--and that is where I get some of this from. But it just seems that they never contemplated--they never worked into their models the kind of move that occurred in the market, and I think that is why they didn't work."
"Senator Pryor","From your standpoint, what ability, if any, do investment banks have to influence a rating by a credit rating agency? Can you kind of, as lawyers say, forum shop and try to find a better rating with a different agency?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know. The first panel that you had today included people who execute deals in connection with obtaining ratings. In my entire career at Goldman Sachs, I never dealt directly with a rating agency other than with the rating of Goldman Sachs."
"Senator Pryor","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I have been very--and I am not sure that I have been able to influence them."
"Senator Pryor","OK. That is fair enough. Let me ask a question I am not sure anyone has asked you on a topic that no one has touched on yet, and that is the use of off balance sheet limited and special investment partnerships. I have a concern about those and----"
"Mr. Blankfein","SIVs?"
"Senator Pryor","What is that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Go ahead. I am sorry."
"Senator Pryor","The off balance sheet limited and special investment partnerships. Why would your company ever want to use an off balance sheet investment vehicle? Why would you all ever do that? What is the motivation to move it off balance sheet?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not sure that we do."
"Senator Pryor","But Goldman does that, right?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am not sure. I think some deal trusts may be--I am just not sure."
"Senator Pryor","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","I could tell you that as a matter of our policy, we mark to market all the risks of the firm, whether they are on balance sheet or off balance sheet, so there would be no P&L consequence to us----"
"Senator Pryor","So they are disclosed? The off balance sheet is disclosed?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know."
"Senator Pryor","OK. Well, we may follow up in another context on that. I would like to ask you about the Securities and Exchange Commission case, if you are comfortable answering these questions, and if your lawyer says you are not, I understand why you wouldn't be, but I do have some questions based on the press release that the SEC sent out back on April 16. If you will answer, I would just like to get a feel for what you think really happened, and I guess I would like to give you a chance to explain some of this. It says, ``Goldman Sachs failed to disclose to investors vital information about the CDO, in particular the role that a major hedge fund played in the portfolio selection process and the fact that the hedge fund had taken a short position against the CDO.'' Is that true, that you failed to disclose that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, well, you obviously know I wasn't there----"
"Senator Pryor","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","But I think our person who testified in the first panel, Fabrice Tourre, maintained that he believed that they did know, and I think that--look, some of these things, it is not a question--you give me license in the sense that you know I wasn't there and I don't know. I am doing the best I can. I think there is a lot of elements of the transaction and reputations and things that suggest they should know and must have known, and then there is also a lot of opinions that are floating out in which some people say they did know. But I think it is not a question of not wanting to tell you. I can't tell you more. I know that one of the contested facts in the case is whether the selection agent knew or didn't know."
"Senator Pryor","Let me ask the follow-up question about your standard of behavior, I guess we can say. Should that information have been disclosed to investors?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I am not sure. In other words, the legal--the complaint is whether the--I mean, at least part of the complaint is whether the influence had an undue--of that person had an undue effect. I don't think there would be anybody--I am not sure that anybody--there is any duty on us to disclose the existence of that short position. This is a synthetic, so there had to have been a short position. If it wasn't them, it would be us. So everybody in the transaction knew, to the extent there was a long, there had to have been a short. The issue is not whether there was a short and whether we were disclosing it. It just has to be a short. The question was, did that short have undue influence on the placement--on the selection agent, and then you get to the situation where our person says--thinks--believes they knew. I think Paulson may have--person may have been quoted as having an opinion on that. And then there is the issue with, well, how could you not know, that kind of element to it. So you get a factual thing, and obviously it is a legal case, so there are people on one side and people on the other, and I don't want to diminish it, but that is the best I can do. That is what the case is. That is the factual issue over which the case is."
"Senator Pryor","Right, and let me go to the next paragraph. It says, ``Goldman wrongly permitted a client that was betting against the mortgage market to heavily influence which mortgage securities to include in an investment portfolio while telling other investors that the securities were selected by an independent, objective third party.'' So the first question is, is that allegation true, and if it is----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, I will do the best I can----"
"Senator Pryor","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","Not knowing any of these facts firsthand. But one of the facts, and I think it is in the SEC's complaint, was that the portfolio that was initially proposed, in which the hedge fund at least participated, and maybe, for all I know, gave--I am not sure, maybe proposed all the names-- more than half those securities were thrown out by the selection agent. Now, in throwing out more than half, they are obviously looking and making a judgment about all of them. They just turned back more than half of them, but that doesn't mean they only looked at that half. They looked at all of them and asked that more than half of them be eliminated. Then Paulson, I guess, proposed others. Some of those were accepted. Some of those were turned back. And then IKB also proposed, I think, some. So there was a healthy back-and-forth over--so it looks like they were--and so every decision that was made, people may have been--there is no deal unless the long and the short agree to it. So there was no doubt because it is part of the record there were conversations between them--but whether the selection agent that had the responsibility and duty to pick that portfolio picked that portfolio. They did. That is our point of view. The SEC, I think, has its point of view. Now, I hope I am doing a good job representing both sides of this because I am really trying to be cooperative and not resort--and not not answering, but that is my best understanding that I have."
"Senator Pryor","This press release also says, ``The marketing materials for the CDO known as Abacus 07 AC-1, all represented that the RMBS portfolio underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management, LLC, a third party with expertise in analyzing credit risk in RMBS.'' The SEC alleges that ``undisclosed in the marketing materials and unbeknownst to the investors, the Paulson and Company hedge fund, which was poised to benefit if the RMBS defaulted, played a significant role in selecting which RMBS should make up the portfolio.'' Is that true, that all the materials represented--that the RMBS portfolio was selected--underlying the CDO was selected by ACA Management? Is that true?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, on the basis of what--that is consistent with what I just said and that is consistent, in my view, that they did select the portfolio. We have an independent auditor. It doesn't mean we don't interact with them. It doesn't mean that we don't give them our views if they have an opinion of how they should treat an accounting item at Goldman Sachs. But at the end of the day, they are the independent auditor and they make the judgment."
"Senator Pryor","And do you have documentation there at your company about what was disclosed to whom and when?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know, but if there is a disclosure document, which I assume there is--I mean, there were disclosure materials, yes."
"Senator Pryor","And so on these type transactions, there are documented disclosure materials that pass among all the parties?"
"Mr. Blankfein","There are disclosure materials, yes."
"Senator Pryor","OK. In the past 25 years, America has seen an increasing number and severity of financial crises. You have the savings and loan crisis, Enron, the dot-com bubble, the housing bubble. What steps will Wall Street take to assure that there is not another financial crisis?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Listen, I think the financial reform is a good step----"
"Senator Pryor","That we are working on now?"
"Mr. Blankfein","That we are working on. There will be gives and takes in it, and I am not sure myself where it would-- nobody is--where it would come out, so the need for reform. I mentioned earlier the need for higher capital standards, systemic risk regulation. That is general. And obviously every firm needs to manage its risks very well and better than they have been doing in most cases. And I think in our case, particularly, you have to look also through every aspect of your business practices to make sure, and to not be defensive, which there is a tendency to be, but to learn from prior situations, including the one we are in now, and make sure that you do a better job."
"Senator Pryor","Well, that was one of my questions that I was going to follow up with, is what are the lessons learned from this most recent financial crisis and what is Goldman doing differently internally now that you have had to go through the bailout and all the other strains and difficulties that we have all gone through the last year and a half?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, even as I am explaining what we did and why I thought it was adequate at the time, there is not a thing that will arise here and elsewhere that won't be the subject of some big soul search and some tightening up of some standards. We have a high level committee in our firm going over every--we call it Business Practices Committee chaired by our vice chairman, one of our named executive officers, that involves the seniormost people in the firm, and it is not with reference to legal requirements, law, whether we can win a lawsuit or lose a lawsuit, what happened, what the standards of the day were, and we are going over everything. Now, we always do things--it is a little bit like painting a bridge. You get to the end of the bridge, you go back, and you paint the beginning because things are evolving. But if we have to--everybody has to tighten up and ratchet their standards up and learn from these elements. You asked me--we were just talking about the standards in that particular transaction that is the subject of the lawsuit. We have the position that we do, and we believe everything is adequate, but given the criticism that we are going under and given the position that the SEC has taken with our duties, we wouldn't do it that way--guess what. We would tighten that up now. Of course, everything that has been the subject of criticism will be tightened up."
"Senator Pryor","There is a company that is based in Little Rock named Stevens, Incorporated. I don't know if you know Stevens, Inc."
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know them well, but I have heard of the company, of course."
"Senator Pryor","And Jack Stevens, one of the founding brothers of that--there were two Stevens brothers that founded that company--he always said that he had the philosophy of, we want to be in business tomorrow, and what he meant by that, and apparently the way Stevens still operates is they want to service their customers, do an excellent job there, and also they want to be prudent and jealously guard the trust of their investors. So Stevens, as far as I know, has never gotten into some of these 20-1, 30-1, 40-1 type leveraged deals. They just don't do that. And I am sure they haven't made as much money as some in the industry have, but also, I think that they have remained very sound through this process. Is Goldman Sachs and/or the industry changing those really high leverage ratios and going back to something that I think is more appropriate, and you may say more conservative, but that is based more on reality rather than just how much money you can make off one transaction?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. I think the industry is substantially less leveraged. I will tell you, we thought we weren't leveraged going into the crisis as much--and we weren't as much as other investment banks like ourselves. With the benefit of hindsight, we were too leveraged even at what we thought at the time was fine and we are substantially--we are less than half as leveraged as we were then. The recency of this crisis is going to reverberate with me for the rest of my career and my life. So I will be--the image of it and the fear and the anxiety that we all had. And so I agree, I think the firm--all firms will be run much more conservatively and I hope for a long time, and I tell you that society will not rely on the good will and the memory of financial firms. I think Congress and regulators will impose tighter-higher capital requirements and liquidity requirements, and I think that is appropriate, because as we also found out in the crisis, we all have interrelated obligations to each other and it wouldn't suit me to have Goldman Sachs be conservative if everybody else is going to take too much risk and put the system at risk, which is why, again, I echo making the world safer and ending too big to fail, I think, is something that is a substantial interest of society at large and also of the industry and Goldman Sachs."
"Senator Pryor","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, thank you for your diligence on this matter. Like I said, this didn't start with you 2 weeks ago. This has been going on for a year and a half and you have just done yeoman's work on this. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Thank you so much, Senator Pryor. Senator Tester."
"Senator Tester","Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to echo Senator Pryor's remarks, and Mr. Blankfein, I appreciate you being here. I am going to get into some questions here that I have prepared, but is Goldman too big to fail?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't believe so."
"Senator Tester","OK. So if Goldman went down, the financial markets wouldn't go into a tailspin that wouldn't be recovered?"
"Mr. Blankfein","If we went into a tailspin in a normal world, one in which everybody else wasn't doing the same thing, which is another issue and, by the way, one you can't rely on because it is very--I said this before. A lot of institutions would have been too big to fail if you were afraid that one spark would set off the whole forest. But I think that, generally, if people's credit is eroding, the market starts to move funds away, stops credit, so firms start to shrink when they get into trouble. But I do think some additional legislation with respect to too big to fail is warranted. I think that, for sure."
"Senator Tester","All right. I really want to follow up on some questions on the first panel and drill down some of the specifics of the Abacus deal, and hopefully you can help me on that. I think we have pretty well established that Goldman and Paulson and Company both played a role in selecting the assets in the Abacus deal. We know that Paulson wanted to short the mortgage market and he picked securities, 84 percent of which were ultimately downgraded within 6 months. We also know from some of the emails included in the exhibits that Goldman was eager to complete the deal. So, Mr. Blankfein, we know you wanted to get the deal done. Goldman wanted to get the deal done. And we know that at least in the previous Abacus deals, of which there were about 15 in total, you did not use an independent portfolio management agent. Why did you ultimately decide to use an independent portfolio management agent in the Abacus 2001 deal and why would you use a manager if the assets had already been selected?"
"Mr. Blankfein","The assets weren't selected. The assets, I think, were being proposed, and what was proposed, more than half of them were rejected by that agent that was picked."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","And I wouldn't--I don't know the circumstances under which you use an agent and in which you don't."
"Senator Tester","I understand. It is a big company. ACA was not the first choice of the portfolio management agent. In fact, they described the arrangement as highly unusual. What I was wondering, was the selection of a portfolio management agent in Abacus 2001 due to the fact that the only investor that could be found was IKB and they indicated they were only interested in the CDOs if you used an independent portfolio agent?"
"Mr. Blankfein","One thing I know for sure is that there was at least another investor, because the independent selection agent itself looked at the portfolio and bought the biggest piece of it. So ACA also invested. But on Abacus and how it was--I am sorry."
"Senator Tester","No, go ahead. Keep going. That does bring up another question, but I will let you finish."
"Mr. Blankfein","But Abacus and how it was structured, I don't know anything more other than what I learned from the questions you asked Fabrice Tourre."
"Senator Tester","OK. I guess I need to know the role, because IKB was hung out for a lot of dough. You said that ACA was an 80 to 90 percent buyer of $1.1 billion----"
"Mr. Blankfein","That was just in my head----"
"Senator Tester","That is OK. Are you saying that IKB only had 10 percent of it? What are we really saying here?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think IKB--we can provide the exact numbers, but to the best of my recollection, that IKB had a total position of something like 150, and I think--and these numbers, I think, are in the complaint--I think the ACA ended up having a total position that was multiples of that, something--I seem to recall something in the 900s of millions."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. IKB, I think, had 150 and ACA had 910 plus 42, representing different parts of the capital structure, so 952 million."
"Senator Tester","And we are talking about these folks were on the long side of things when Paulson was on the short side?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Correct."
"Senator Tester","And when it was marketed to IKB, because this is a question that has been brought up, because we are talking about disclosure and transparency and conflict of interest and all that stuff, but was IKB told that Paulson was a part of the process in selecting the securities?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, all I have is the testimony, the information we have from Fabrice Tourre. I don't have independent knowledge of it. I just don't."
"Senator Tester","OK. Well, all right. I listed off about four or five different--four, I think it was, different arrangements that Goldman had, and I do agree with Senator McCaskill that there should probably be four or five other folks up beside you as we move forward and try to dig down into this. I have been sitting here trying to really figure out a good analogy of how this happened, and I get the impression from the fellows that were up here earlier today and you that this is kind of--works well at times that folks can pick securities with their perspective that they are going to fail because they sell them short and then try to market them to somebody else who thinks they are going to be successful. And that is kind of the way business is being done----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I am sorry, the securities weren't meant to fail. They succeeded by conveying the risk that people wanted to have, and in a market, that is not a failure. Somebody had asked me----"
"Senator Tester","We are like we are speaking a different language here, and that is not being critical of you----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, that is my fault----"
"Senator Tester","No, it is not. But it seems to me more than just a little bit odd that Paulson picked these securities because he was going to make some dough on them because they were going to go down, and so he sold them short so that would happen. He picked the securities that he could sell short so he could make money on, and somebody else, somebody else that maybe didn't have the information that Paulson had--so that is where the disclosure and the transparency comes in--figured that they were going to be OK, so they bought the long side. That may be oversimplifying. It seems to me, and it is not like selling a lame horse or an unsound horse. It is not like selling a bin of corn that has been through a cow and you are calling it corn when it is really something else----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Right. I think in these transactions, sometimes the buyer comes to you and reverse inquires and wants somebody to offer the other side. Most of these transactions are initiated--most transactions are initiated by one side or the other, and in the absence of two sides, usually we provide the side."
"Senator Tester","OK. Because what I have read here indicates that this independent portfolio selection agency on Abacus 07 AC-1 was selected, that ACA was selected because there was an outfit by the name of IKB that wanted to buy it, and the only way they would buy it is if you had this independent portfolio selection agent. You are saying that is not correct?"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I am not saying that is not correct. I read that, too. What I am saying is I don't have--I just can't go through the ins and outs of it because I just don't know more than what I have heard."
"Senator Tester","OK. Well, I can tell you here, right and wrong are indifferent. It really sounds like there was a failure to disclose information relevant to the parties in the transaction. That is what it sounds like to me. The vehicles, synthetic financial vehicles, and I know you said everybody has the right to hedge their risk, but these go beyond that. I mean, they really do. It is more like a scam. I came in and I heard you talk about your clients being critically important. This is early on."
"Mr. Blankfein","Right."
"Senator Tester","And I think anybody would think that-- anybody would know that. I mean, that is probably the most important thing you can do, although the previous folks who were up here today said that they really wouldn't say whether they worked for the clients or worked for the company. They said they were market----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Makers."
"Senator Tester","They were market makers. That is what they said they were. But the fact is, it was ironic to me that they wouldn't say they worked for the clients."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, the----"
"Senator Tester","And that speaks volumes in and of itself. Why would the clients believe in Goldman Sachs?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, there are parts of our business that are fiduciary--and it will sound splitting--but there is a market and you can't--when you are a principal--I can understand their confusion in answering the question. I am trying to explain it, and I wish I were better to explain it. There are parts of the business where you are a money manager, where you owe a duty to the client. There are parts of the business where you are a principal and you are giving the client what it wants and it is understood where you have to know that they are suitable, you have to know that the product you do delivers what they expect to have, but the markets couldn't work if you had to make sure it was good for them."
"Senator Tester","So what you are saying, in one case, you are working for the client. In the other case, you are setting markets."
"Mr. Blankfein","But they are also--and I will tell you, in the business world, if we are not the biggest, most important market maker, we are right up there."
"Senator Tester","OK."
"Mr. Blankfein","In other words, we do well at this and our clients value us for this."
"Senator Tester","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","In other words, it is not--what I am describing to you----"
"Senator Tester","And one doesn't bleed over into the other, or vice-versa?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think the market understands when these people are buying--I will say it like----"
"Senator Tester","So what are your responsibilities----"
"Mr. Blankfein","They are buying for their own P&L."
"Senator Tester","OK. And so what are your responsibilities when you create a product? Do you have any?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, huge, fairness, that it be effective. We have a whole process in our firm----"
"Senator Tester","Is disclosure part of it when you create a product?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think there are disclosure requirements in connection with underwritings, and we are talking about these are underwritings, what you are talking about."
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. But the disclosure is the disclosure of the risks associated with that. It is not related to whether you are long or short also or whether housing is going up and down."
"Senator Tester","I guess the point is, is disclosure----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Does the product work? Does the product deliver what the client seeks?"
"Senator Tester","Yes. But disclosure----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Disclosure is very----"
"Senator Tester","If disclosure isn't given equally to both sides, because you said there have got to be two sides for this to work, if it is not given equally to both sides, whose responsibility is that to make sure that the information is given to both sides? It is not you, or is it you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","The disclosure requirements in an underwrite, again, are very well evolved."
"Senator Tester","OK. So is it you? Do you have to disclose to both sides what is in so that both sides know?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think the disclosure document would disclose to the world of buyers of that instrument. I mean, I think it is in the----"
"Senator Tester","So you think IKB knew that Paulson was part of selecting the securities?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Again, this is what the lawsuit is, over whether we satisfied it, and that is a factual and a legal dispute now."
"Senator Tester","OK. You know the instruments. Do you, on behalf of Goldman, accept any responsibility for the collapse of 2008?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Tester","Are you in any way embarrassed that the U.S. taxpayer had to bail out Goldman?"
"Mr. Blankfein","We got funds from the government, and it was an embarrassing situation then and it is embarrassing now."
"Senator Tester","Do you think that those funds were critically important as to you being able to stay in business?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think they were critically important. I don't know what would--I can't say what would have happened otherwise----"
"Senator Tester","I understand."
"Mr. Blankfein","But they were critically important for the system and, therefore, critically important to us."
"Senator Tester","Do you feel you owe anything to the taxpayers because of that bailout?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I think, yes, and we owe--we live in the good--yes, we--and for many other reasons. I would like to say, Senator, also, on the--and I am answering you without qualification on all those points----"
"Senator Tester","That is right."
"Mr. Blankfein","But we were not waiting for government bailout. We--and I think this was quite famous and observed, that weeks before that, we did a transaction with Warren Buffett where we gave him equity warrants on a substantial portion of Goldman Sachs in exchange for his investment in Goldman Sachs, which I could tell you, he wouldn't do in a million years if he thought we were going to fail because he makes money and he doesn't give it away, even if he liked us. And then a day after that transaction, we did an equity deal, a common equity deal in the market where we raised another--his was $5 billion--we raised another $5.75 billion dollars. Those deals closed, I think, 3 or 4 weeks before the TARP. So I think the TARP and the action that the government took was--you used the word critical, I will echo that critical. It was critical for the overall environment. If the market seized up and no one could get financing again, it would have affected everybody including us. And so we are grateful for it. We expressed that gratitude. But we could get financing in the world. We got it. And, frankly, when we took the five-and-three-quarters, we could have gotten more if we wanted. So it was critical because I think there was a--I don't know whether the system would have gone completely out of kilter if it hadn't been done, but it was too much of a risk and I am really glad--and we were beneficiaries of what happened."
"Senator Tester","Well, I appreciate it. I can tell you that there are some things in my job as a U.S. Senator from Montana that don't make a lot of sense. One of the things that doesn't make a lot of sense to me is why these synthetic--and I know you have got an answer for it--but why these synthetic instruments came about when there is nothing in them. And Senator McCaskill is right. It is just like betting on a sports event. It is like betting on whether it is going to rain. It is like betting on a bunch of stuff that doesn't make any sense. It is not like hedging as a farmer would do it or as an airline or a coal company or whatever might be. This is just playing around, from my perspective. And the fact is that I think part of this playing around is why taxpayers had to bail out part of what went on on Wall Street. I have got some issues with that, and I, like other Members on this Subcommittee, think you are a smart guy and I would like to work with you. I think this country is in dire need of Wall Street reform and I think that you could add some to the equation as long as we can bore down and get to the facts----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I----"
"Senator Tester","And transparency is critically important, and making sure that consumers are protected. I can't tell you how many stories I have heard of folks who have lost their retirement, lost their college tuition for their kids, lost all sorts of bad things while other folks that got bailed out are making literally millions of dollars."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I agree and I would like to be helpful and I will be helpful. And I would like to say another thing. I can tell you, and I tried to, what the hedging purpose was of having people be able to take long or short positions synthetically in housing in order to shape their portfolios. But that is not the end of the inquiry. If at the end of the day, even if that--so I am explaining what the purpose is. But even at the end of the day, if they are too complicated and too risky and generate the kind of risk that apparently these did, then notwithstanding--finding a social purpose or a hedging purpose in them is not the end. Notwithstanding that, they may be something that should not be permitted, and so, therefore, I am not making a spirited defense that anybody could think of should be done."
"Senator Tester","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","Clearly, the world needs more regulation."
"Senator Tester","And I think part of this, as I look at it as a regular person, you have a guy by the name of Paulson who is picking out--who had a role in it. He may not have been the only person, but he had a role in picking out these securities and I firmly believe, from what I have read, he picked them so they would fail so he could sell them short, and I think somebody else may have not been told the story that Paulson knew on the one side of the equation. And I think that is where the problem is, also. Thank you very much. I appreciate it, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for being here, Mr. Blankfein."
"Mr. Blankfein","Thank you, Senator."
"Senator Levin","Thank you very much, Senator Tester. Let me just pick up where Senator Tester left off. These credit default swaps that you engaged in, these synthetics, in my judgment and I think most people's judgment, do not serve a social purpose. Maybe you can try to find one there, but in most people's minds, there is no social purpose. It is a bet not on whether or not your particular house will go up or down in value or that particular house will that you have an interest in. It is a bet on something that you have no interest in, where there is no collateral involved, there is no risk being taken by collateral, where people are betting whether or not some event will occur. And what happened here is that you won that bet. You won that bet with AIG."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. We lost that. We lost money in that ACA deal."
"Senator Levin","No. I am not saying on the ACA deal."
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry."
"Senator Levin","The only reason you lost money on the ACA deal was because you ended up with a piece of the long on that----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Right."
"Senator Levin","That you did not intend to have. We heard that earlier today."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I am afraid, with due respect, that misses the point."
"Senator Levin","No. You said that you lost money on the deal."
"Mr. Blankfein","We did."
"Senator Levin","I understand what you are saying, but now listen to what I am saying. You intended to sell that piece of the long and couldn't do it."
"Mr. Blankfein","Right. Therefore----"
"Senator Levin","You had never intended----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We took the risk and we failed----"
"Senator Levin","You had never intended to invest in that deal."
"Mr. Blankfein","We intend to sell everything we have as profit. The reason why it is risky----"
"Senator Levin","No. You don't intend to sell your short positions all the time, do you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well----"
"Senator Levin","You intended to keep short positions in all kinds of transactions we went into today. You insisted on keeping short positions even when a client preferred that short position. We gave an example of that. You put your own interest ahead of your client when the client wanted a short position in one of these deals. So you were doing that for your own proprietary interest in those other deals. You were keeping a short position. You wanted to go short. In this one, you didn't want to go short. I understand that. But you were paid a whole bunch of money by the Federal Government. AIG owed you that money, did they not?"
"Mr. Blankfein","AIG--I am sorry, we are switching----"
"Senator Levin","Did AIG owe you some money, and the money which was paid to AIG through the TARP program then was filtered through to you? Is that true?"
"Mr. Blankfein","They--AIG had--yes. Yes. AIG owed us margin, most of which we had collected."
"Senator Levin","Right. But they owed you some money, and the TARP funds ended up paying their debt to you, did it not?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I don't know if those were TARP funds. I am not sure."
"Senator Levin","You don't know whether TARP funds that went to AIG then came through to you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","They were--again, I don't know what pocket they came from. I know that government money went into AIG and that money flowed through."
"Senator Levin","And that money flowed through. How many billions of dollars flowed through, government money, to you through AIG?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, literally, the cash flow has been reported, and I think David Viniar went through this. It went to $12.9 billion flowed. They gave us stuff and we gave them back stuff. So, in other words, it wasn't $12.9 billion----"
"Senator Levin","What was it that flowed to you net? Of those funds through AIG?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Net of what we gave them back?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","I would say the only thing that----"
"Senator Levin","Just give me a dollar figure, if you would."
"Mr. Blankfein","The only thing that flowed through to us was an additional $2.5 billion worth of margin that they owed us against which we had an insurance contract in case they didn't pay us."
"Senator Levin","I understand. But they owed you $2.5 billion."
"Mr. Blankfein","They owed us $2.5 billion."
"Senator Levin","The government did not owe you $2.5 billion, did we?"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, the government did not."
"Senator Levin","But you ended up with $2.5 billion of taxpayers' funds."
"Mr. Blankfein","That we would have gotten from an insurance company had we not."
"Senator Levin","Yes, but you wouldn't have gotten it from the taxpayers."
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, we weren't looking to get it from the taxpayers."
"Senator Levin","But you got it from the taxpayers."
"Mr. Blankfein","In lieu of what would have come from the insurance----"
"Senator Levin","From a private party. We didn't owe you any money."
"Mr. Blankfein","I didn't----"
"Senator Levin","Two private parties owed you money, either AIG or that insurance company that you insured the AIG debt with. So why do you end up with $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money in your pocket when we don't owe you the money? AIG owes you the money or an insurance company owes you the money----"
"Mr. Blankfein","But the U.S. Government decided not to allow AIG to default. And if they had defaulted, that is, if they had not paid us the money, they would have been in default and we would have gotten paid from an insurance company."
"Senator Levin","You would have gotten paid from somebody other than the taxpayer."
"Mr. Blankfein","Correct."
"Senator Levin","So why do you end up with $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Because the government made a decision that the government didn't want AIG to default."
"Senator Levin","And you could have gotten that money from a private insurance company."
"Mr. Blankfein","Correct."
"Senator Levin","And so now you have got money of the taxpayers in your pocket----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, we got money from AIG."
"Senator Levin","That was taxpayers' money, Mr. Blankfein. Yes?"
"Mr. Blankfein","AIG got money from the government----"
"Senator Levin","Taxpayers' money."
"Mr. Blankfein","That paid it over to us----"
"Senator Levin","Right. That is what I am saying."
"Mr. Blankfein","So that we got that $2.5 billion instead of the $2.5 billion we would have gotten in insurance."
"Senator Levin","I know we are going around and around----"
"Mr. Blankfein","We are."
"Senator Levin","But the facts still are that you got $2.5 billion of taxpayers' money on a private deal. Does that bother you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","It bothers me to the----"
"Senator Levin","So why didn't you go after that other insurance company instead of taking taxpayers' money? Why isn't that unjust enrichment at the expense of the taxpayers? Why don't you go after the insurance----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Because it was insurance against the default of AIG. By the U.S. Government intervening, AIG didn't default and therefore they didn't owe us the insurance. So we were either going to get it from AIG, or upon their default from the insurance."
"Senator Levin","Right."
"Mr. Blankfein","One way or the other, we would get the $2.5 billion."
"Senator Levin","Right. But you wouldn't have gotten it from taxpayers' money if you had gotten it from the private parties."
"Mr. Blankfein","I would have much rather----"
"Senator Levin","Let me ask you, did you have any conversations with anybody at the Treasury Department about that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","About----"
"Senator Levin","Whether or not AIG would get money and then pay it to you?"
"Mr. Blankfein","No."
"Senator Levin","You had no conversations with anybody at the Treasury Department or the Federal Government?"
"Mr. Blankfein","At the time of the announcement, I was asked by my regulator, maybe all of my regulators, are you OK, in other words, do you have exposure, and I said, no, we don't. That was the--because we had this insurance contract. And by the way, $2.5 billion wouldn't have caused us that much--in other words, that is not necessarily an unmanageable number, but----"
"Senator Levin","If it is not unmanageable for you, it is kind of disgraceful from the taxpayers' point of view that you end up with taxpayers' money which we don't owe you. We didn't owe you that."
"Mr. Blankfein","Only because AIG owed it and because the government did not want AIG to fail. AIG honored its obligations and paid us. Without that, we would have gotten our insurance on the----"
"Senator Levin","I know. I understand you would have gotten it from a private source, not from the taxpayers."
"Mr. Blankfein","Correct."
"Senator Levin","You said that a number of times here. There was a statement of the Senators in the 1930s who were investigating the Great Depression. I don't know if you heard this this morning or not. Did you hear my opening statement this morning by any chance?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, I did."
"Senator Levin","And what they said is that investors must believe that their investment banker would not offer them bonds unless the banker believed them to be safe, and ended up saying, but while the banker may make mistakes, he must never make the mistake of offering investments to his clients which he does not believe in. Now, you turned that idea, which is a pretty fundamental idea, offering to clients investments that the banker does not believe in, you said you shouldn't have to be sure that an investment is good for a client. I agree with that. But that is not the issue. You can't guarantee an investment is going to be good for a client. The question is if you believe that it is a bad investment for that client because you are going short against that at the same time you are selling it, that is what these Senators back in the 1930s were saying was one of the causes of the Great Depression, that bankers were selling things, making money for themselves, by selling things that they didn't believe in. And that is what happened here. You were selling things that you didn't believe in. What was the sure test of that is that you were betting against them at the same time you were selling them. You were taking and intending to keep a short position, and that is a very different thing from what you said about 20 minutes ago, that is you should not have to make sure that an investment is good for the client. No one is saying that. Of course, you can't make sure. But you can make sure that someone you sell an investment to knows that you believe it is a bad investment and that you, at the same time, are betting against that same investment. Now, I am going to leave it at that. You obviously don't see that. It troubles me that you don't see that. It troubles me that you don't see that your client is yourself, that is what this has turned into too often, is that Goldman Sachs has turned itself into its own client and has taken advantage of a relationship by doing what you did in so many of these cases. And another thing you did, you took stuff from your own inventory in massive amounts which you didn't believe in and sold it. That is OK, but you did more than that. You then bet against your own sale. That happened in at least two of these cases. That is what is so troubling to me. Now, there is another problem here which is the bigger issue, a broader issue, that you made a major decision to bet against the housing market. We can spend a lot more time on that if you want to. Let us put up a couple of charts here to just show you very quickly what I mean by that. Put up the chart about their long sales. Exhibit 163.\1\  \1\ See Exhibit No. 163, which appears in the Appendix on page   Now, if you take a look at Exhibit 50 \2\--I will get to Exhibit 163 in a minute. This is what you sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 7, 2007. If you look at page 5, you will see here that you said your long cash subprime mortgage exposure consists of mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities. And then you said, ``As of August 31, 2007 and November 24, 2006 our investments in subprime mortgages totaled $462 million and $7.8 billion, respectively, and our investments in subprime mortgage-backed.''  \2\ See Exhibit No. 50, which appears in the Appendix on page 390. "
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. I am not following."
"Senator Levin","OK. Page 5, do you see that? Exhibit 50."
"Mr. Blankfein","Give me one second to see what----"
"Senator Levin","Sure."
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. I am just cautioning that I haven't seen this paper before."
"Senator Levin","This table?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. I am just cautioning that I have never seen this piece of paper, but----"
"Senator Levin","OK. Well, this is a letter that Goldman Sachs sent to the Securities and Exchange Commission on November 7. So here is what you folks said. You said what your investments were in November 2006 and what your investments-- this is on the long side now--of August 2007. That is what happened to your investments. Take a look at this chart that we have got over here, and I will give you the number of it if you want to look at a smaller one, but that is what you did on the long side. That is what you were selling long, OK. Now, you also went short, big time. You don't acknowledge it is big time. You said it was, what, a small net short. After deducting your long position, you said that your short position was what? You used the word ``small,'' I believe."
"Mr. Blankfein","I used the word ``small'' because the one immutable fact, and the way you really can tell--because some of--you can't----"
"Senator Levin","OK. Use the word ``small.'' That is OK. Let us take a look----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Levin","Let us take a look at how small they were. Let us just take a look at how small your net shorts were. We put up another chart, which is based on your numbers, and I will give you the numbers in a minute. This chart shows how net short you were. That is total net short. That is taking everything into consideration. I am going to give you the numbers right now on that. Exhibit 162.\1\ Take a look at this chart.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 162, which appears in the Appendix on page 997.  This chart, which is the same one as you see up there, was taken from information from your Mortgage Department's top sheets, which were supplied by Goldman from February to December 2007, listing the department's short positions, Goldman's short positions, several times per month. Now, we gave you an example, if you will look at that, of those top sheets."
"Mr. Blankfein","Where am I looking? I am sorry."
"Senator Levin","You are looking at Exhibit 162. Do you see that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Not yet. I am doing the best I can. It is just that graph."
"Senator Levin","This is your short positions. Now, this is based on your top sheets, by the way. This is what you call small net shorts. Every single day, by the way, you are net short, so that is not something which was sporadic, until December when you cashed in your net shorts. But everyday until December 20, you had a net short, as high as $13 billion. And the back-up sheets you have seen there are attached to that exhibit. Is that what you would call a small net short, $13 billion?"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, I think--you can't go by the gross amount because some of these positions don't move. The way you can tell whether you are short and long, really, the best way is, look, if you were short early in the crisis----"
"Senator Levin","I am just asking you. You said these were small positions."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, they are."
"Senator Levin","I didn't use the word ``small.''"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I am doing the best I can, and I am trying to be responsive."
"Senator Levin","The answer is yes. If you think $12 billion is a small net short, the answer is, you think that is small."
"Mr. Blankfein","This didn't act like a $12 billion position. You can see our entire P&L from residential for the whole year 2007 was under $500 million. There are--you can have gross headline numbers, but early in the crisis, if the better credit--if you are long the better credit, the slightly better credit, and short the slightly worse credit, the positions you are short could move more than the positions you are long, and those could reverse at different times. In these complicated portfolios, you can have gross numbers that were long or short, but the portfolio didn't necessarily react that way. That is why successive people who have testified here, including our risk managers, said you really had to look at how they behaved. The best evidence of how they behaved is what was the P&L from it? When the market went down, did it make money or lose money, and it----"
"Senator Levin","Fine. Let us look at the P&L."
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. "
"Senator Levin","Are you familiar with Exhibit 55b? \1\ We talked about this today. This is Mr. Swenson's performance evaluation. ``Extraordinary profits'' from the shorts at his desk, $3 billion as of September 2007. ``Tremendous profits,'' he said, ``extraordinary profits.''  \1\ See Exhibit No. 55b, which appears in the Appendix on page 441. "
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. I see Tab 55, and then it goes to 56. Is there an a and b?"
"Senator Levin","Exhibit 55 a, b, and c. First, there is a b. Do you see that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I go from Exhibit 55 to 56."
"Senator Levin","It is inside Exhibit 55."
"Mr. Blankfein","Is there a tab?"
"Senator Levin","It is just inside Exhibit 55."
"Mr. Blankfein","Reviewee's feedback?"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","OK, sorry. It was Exhibit 55."
"Senator Levin","Mr. Swenson talked about ``extraordinary profits,'' ``tremendous profits,'' ``$3 billion.''"
"Mr. Blankfein","Where am I looking on Exhibit 55? "
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. I see it now, sir. What page number?"
"Senator Levin","Page 2. Do you see that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes. I am on page 2 now."
"Senator Levin","Do you see there where it says ``tremendous profits'' in the second paragraph? Is $3 billion a tremendous profit?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I see the contributions to the $3 billion of SBG trading profits?"
"Senator Levin","Yes. Do you consider that a tremendous profit?"
"Mr. Blankfein","For that trading desk----"
"Senator Levin","Yes."
"Mr. Blankfein","It would have been, and I think the guy who is writing this is bragging about his local business."
"Senator Levin","Right. Local? That was a big part of your business that year, wasn't it?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Well, it was adjacent to other businesses. I would never even see this. I would see the mortgage----"
"Senator Levin","That is why I am showing it to you right now. I am just asking you, do you think that is a big profit, $3 billion?"
"Mr. Blankfein","That is a big number, just like the loss in his adjacent business is a big loss."
"Senator Levin","That was the profit they made."
"Mr. Blankfein","That was the revenue----"
"Senator Levin","The profits they made that year on short sales. That is what we are talking about, taking short positions, they made huge profits. What you want to do is deduct the long positions, which you had in your inventory mainly, from that. That is not the question. Did you bet big time in 2007 against the housing mortgage business, and you did. You went big and short----"
"Mr. Blankfein","No, we did not."
"Senator Levin","Well, let us take a look at what you told your Board."
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator Levin","Go to Exhibit 18.\1\ This is from Sparks. This was just in the synthetics.  \1\ See Exhibit No. 18, which appears in the Appendix on page 271. "
"Mr. Blankfein","Is one local----"
"Senator Levin","I know. Everything is local. I am just telling you what happened in the shift. I will get to the major shift in a minute. That is what you told your Board, that there was a major shift, OK, but I will get to that in a minute. Let us talk about what made up that major shift."
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. I am looking at----"
"Senator Levin","``In  synthetic space,'' and that is what we have been talking about--do you see that at the bottom----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Exhibit 18?"
"Senator Levin","On Exhibit 18?"
"Mr. Blankfein","In synthetic space, yes."
"Senator Levin","``The desk started the quarter with long, $6 billion . . . and shifted the position to net short $10 billion . . . by reducing the longs . . . and increasing shorts.'' That is what it says. Now, that was one piece of your operation. They shifted from long to short. Then you told the SEC on Form 8-K, which is Exhibit 154,\2\ and this is dated September 20----  \2\ See Exhibit No. 154, which appears in the Appendix on page 966. "
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry. Where am I looking?"
"Senator Levin","You are looking at Exhibit 154."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","Have you got it?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, I do. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","OK, page 3, second paragraph, second line. ``Net revenues in mortgages were also significantly higher, despite continued deterioration in the market environment. Significant losses on non-prime loans and securities were more than offset by gains on short mortgage positions.'' OK. So your significant losses on the non-prime loans and securities were more than offset by gains on the short mortgage positions. That was some of your net short positions. Now take a look at Exhibit 46,\3\ page 3, the bottom paragraph. ``It is important to note however that we are active traders of mortgage securities and loans and, as with any of the financial instruments we trade, at any point in time we may choose to take a directional view of the market''--that is what you deny--``and will express that view through the use of mortgage securities, loans, and derivatives. Therefore, although we did have long balance sheet exposure to sub-prime securities in the past three years, albeit small exposure, our net risk position was variously either long or short depending on our changing view of the market.''  \3\ See Exhibit No. 46, which appears in the Appendix on page 361. "
"Mr. Blankfein","Sure."
"Senator Levin","It is a view of the market--this is your own filing, by the way--changing view of the market. ``For example, during most of 2007, we maintained a net short sub-prime position and therefore stood to benefit from declining prices in the mortgage market.'' That is your filing. Now, take a look at Exhibit 48,\1\ a Tax Department Presentation, October 2007. Here, on page 2, right in the middle. ``So what happened to us? A quick word on our own market and credit risk performance in this regard. In market risk - you saw in our 2nd and 3rd qtr results that we made money despite our inherently long cash positions.'' Inherently long. That is what was inherited----  \1\ See Exhibit No. 48, which appears in the Appendix on page 376. "
"Mr. Blankfein","No, inherent, not inherited."
"Senator Levin","Both. Much of it was inherited, right? They were in your inventory, and some of it for a long time, but OK. You don't know the breakdown of it. I am going to keep reading. ``Because starting early in 2007, our mortgage trading desk started putting on big short positions.'' OK. Those aren't my words. Those are Goldman Sachs' words. ``Big short positions, mostly using the ABX, which is a family of indices designed to replicate cash bonds, and did so in enough quantity that we were net short and made money, substantial money in the third quarter as the subprime market weakened. This remains our position today.'' That is your Tax Department's presentation. You made ``substantial money in the third quarter.'' I am sorry, that was the Chief Risk Officer who said this in an internal presentation to Goldman's Tax Department, to be perfectly accurate. Then you did that Form 8-K filing, which we have already read about, talking about you did very well that year. You did very well because you had a big short. And then Exhibit 45.\2\ That is the conference call that Goldman held for the third quarter of 2007. ``Our risk bias from that market was to be short and that net short position was profitable.'' No hedge there. Profitable because of our short position.  \2\ See Exhibit No. 45, which appears in the Appendix on page 349.  Then there is that September conference call. Let me go on. Now, what had happened is that you had a meeting with your Board of Directors--I assume that you would have been there--in March 2007. That is Exhibit 22.\3\ You had made a decision. There were big problems, we have heard all day long, about the subprime sector, about mortgages, and that shows on page 8 of Exhibit 22, if we are together. The first quarter: ``Long position grows with increased market activity.'' This is back in 2006, first and second quarter of 2006. Do you see that arrow? Going back to 2006, you reported----  \3\ See Exhibit No. 22, which appears in the Appendix on page 276. "
"Mr. Blankfein","What page?"
"Senator Levin","Eight. Do you see that big arrow in the middle?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I do."
"Senator Levin","OK. And then the first and second quarter of 2006, your long position grows. And then as you go down 2006, third and fourth quarter, you start scaling back purchasing of riskier loans. You reduce your CDO activity. Residual assets-- those are the ones in your inventory--marked down to reflect market deterioration--and look here--Goldman Sachs ``reverses long market position through purchases of single-name CDS and reductions of ABX.'' You are reversing your long market position. That is a direction for most people's vocabulary. You don't like to use the word ``direction'' in your public statements, but that is what happened. You told the Board that you reversed the long market position. And then when you had the next Board meeting in September, you told your Board, and this is Exhibit 41,\1\ page 4--have you got it?  \1\ See Exhibit No. 41, which appears in the Appendix on page 327. "
"Mr. Blankfein","I do."
"Senator Levin","OK. This is what you told your Board in September, you were going back, and on page 4, you will see the first quarter. What did you do in the first quarter? You ``shut down all residential mortgage warehouses.'' You ``reduced loan position.'' You ``increased protection''--that means going short--``on disaster scenarios.'' In the second quarter, you ``shut down all  CDO warehouses.'' You ``took significant mark to market losses.'' You ``reduced loan purchases.'' You ``reduced counterparty exposure.'' And then in quarter two and three, here is what you said. You ``positioned  business tactically.'' And this, by the way, is under the heading, ``The business has taken proactive steps to position the firm strategically in the ensuing mortgage credit and liquidity crisis.'' Perfectly proper, what you did. That is not the issue. You ``shorted synthetics.'' You ``shorted CDOs and RMBS.'' You ``reduced  long inventory.'' You were short, short, short. You shorted like crazy. It is clear from all these documents. Mr. Blankfein, you can say publicly that there was no direction here, but your documents show otherwise. The words are used even to the Board that you ``shifted''--changed your position from long to short. You told the Board repeatedly what you were doing to focus on the short position. So there is clearly a directional change. It was so sharp, I think you may have been the only bank like yourself that made money when the housing bubble burst. You made--maybe you don't think it is a lot of money, maybe it is not the amount of money you usually make in a month or a year, but according to your own records, it was a billion dollars net, after all of your long losses in that year. You say it is a half-a-billion. OK. Your records show it is a billion, but we won't quibble over half-a-billion dollars. You came out ahead in 2007 in a market which crashed, and you did it because you went short, big time, big short, in your own words, Mr. Viniar's words. You don't want to acknowledge that, I know, but that is what your own documents show. I am not sure, again, why it is that you are saying these things publicly, like there was no directional change and that you weren't big net short in 2007 when you were. These are big net short positions. I know you are saying those are net short, and they are. If you just looked at the short side, they would be huge. But you don't want to look at the short side, and that is okay. You want to look at the net short side. You were up to $13 billion net short and there wasn't a day that year, until the end of December, when you actually had anything other than a net short position. So you want folks to trust you. You basically want folks to trust you, but here is the way I have seen it. We have been through this business of selling securities to people and in that same deal not telling them that you were betting against those securities. We have gone through that----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Will you indulge me for one second?"
"Senator Levin","Yes. Just wait until I am done, because I want to give you my view. You want to be trusted. I am glad you want to be trusted, but I think you can understand why there are a lot of folks who have some real doubts when, you don't acknowledge the big short, you try to hedge that, tamp that down, and when you also over and over again in these documents, which we went through today in the first panel, you were selling securities to your clients at the same time you are betting against those same securities. Now, you can argue that people know that, and what I am saying to you is that people expect, as those 1930's Senators said, that bankers would be selling things that they would expect or hope or believe will be OK, not that they are betting against. And so that is what we have shown as to the problems. You are in a fairly unique position, by the way, not just because of your big size but because of the big short. The big short puts your bank in a position where you were one of the rare banks that actually came out okay in 2007. The other ones who were on the wrong side, on the long side, who didn't engage in the big short like you did, lost big time. Some of them went under. And so it is not the fact that you made a profit. It is not the fact even that you went short. You have a right to go short. It is the conflict. It is the conflict that is so troubling to me between going in that direction, clearly changing direction--nothing could be clearer from these documents. You told your Board you were changing direction. Your documents show changing direction. But then in that process, over and over again in securities that you were selling to customers, you bet against those securities simultaneously with the sale as part of the security distribution, and that is part that troubles me most, I think. There are a lot of things that trouble me here, including the language that--not just the language, the beliefs that your own sales people had that they were selling junk or crap. And when you say that nothing you heard today troubled you--that is what you answered one of my colleagues, that nothing you heard from that first panel troubled you, you thought it was all OK, one of my colleagues pressed you on that. I don't know whether you heard----"
"Mr. Blankfein","He asked me concerned, and I----"
"Senator Levin","Concerned."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes."
"Senator Levin","That is OK. If that didn't concern you, that the people who are selling securities under your name believe that they are selling crap or junk, and words even saltier than those, if that doesn't concern you, that concerns me and, I think, would concern an awful lot of people in this country. You shouldn't be selling junk. You shouldn't be selling crap. You shouldn't be betting against your own customer at the same time you are selling to them. And that all coming together is creating a necessity that we take some regulatory steps in the conflict of interest area. There is an amendment which will be offered, introduced to the Dodd bill which will strengthen the bill in that regard, in the conflict of interest area, because the conflict of interest not only exists there, it exists--and I think maybe you or another Goldman representative today acknowledged that--in the area of credit rating. There is the appearance of a conflict of interest, because you folks are paying the credit raters to rate securities that you are selling, and it is clearly in your interest that they be AAA. Do you remember during the deposition that you had with my staff, do you remember being asked the question----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, have we moved past the question you----"
"Senator Levin","Yes. Do you want to comment on what I just said? That is OK. You can comment on what I just said and then I will go back to the credit rating agencies. Go on."
"Mr. Blankfein","I would say, Senator, people are using language, big change, what they think, whether an isolated individual is characterizing his P&L in isolation versus the other position adjacent to him. The one unmutable fact here that is in the past that is ascertainable, that is audited, is the net of all these positions in the market yielded less than $500 million worth of revenue in the residential space in "
"Senator Levin","In 2007----"
"Mr. Blankfein","And lost $1.7 billion in 2008."
"Senator Levin","We are not talking 2008."
"Mr. Blankfein","In the context----"
"Senator Levin","The bubble burst in 2007. We are looking at the causes of that bubble bursting."
"Mr. Blankfein","In the context of the chaos in the market, all the size positions, all the market making we were doing in that period of time, with all that was going on, getting within $500 million of flat during that year 2007, I think, reflects a desire and an accomplishment to get closer to home. We bought-- OK, and I will just--so anyway, I just wanted to respond to you----"
"Senator Levin","You may not think a half-a-billion dollars is a lot, but the fact that you were able to get through 2007, when the bubble burst, was because you went with the big short. Those are your own----"
"Mr. Blankfein","Less than 1 percent of our revenues that year."
"Senator Levin","I know, but 56 percent of your value at risk."
"Mr. Blankfein","Because the market volatility----"
"Senator Levin","I know the because, but you put a huge amount of value at risk to go short in that market."
"Mr. Blankfein","The market forced the value at risk higher because of the volatility."
"Senator Levin","All right. Now let us talk about the credit rating agencies. We asked you this question during your deposition.\1\ These are your words, so you will probably remember them. We are going to get you a copy.  \1\ Exhibit No. 176, Deposition of Lloyd C. Blankfein, a Sealed Exhibit, is retained in the files of the Subcommittee. "
"Mr. Blankfein","OK. Thank you."
"Senator Levin","Take a look at page 46, if you would."
"Mr. Blankfein","Page 46."
"Senator Levin","Got it? Near the bottom."
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, sir."
"Senator Levin","Now, at the bottom, line 25, ``Either based on your own knowledge and opinions or what your senior executives may have expressed to you, how critical did Goldman believe that the ratings given by the CRAs were to the--how critical were those ratings to the successful marketing and selling of RMBSs and CDOs?'' Your answer, ``I don't know what the standards--I don't know what drove the business. I don't know what drove the business. I don't know how important they were in the business to investors.'' You don't know how important they are. We do. OK, the next question. ``But did you understand that at least there were certain classes of investors that could only invest in certain rated products?'' Your answer, ``I never thought of it.'' It strains credulity that you never thought there are classes of investors that can only invest in AAA products. Is that something you really never thought about, never knew?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I never thought of it."
"Senator Levin","You never thought of the importance of AAA, that there are a whole bunch of institutions, universities, and a whole bunch of other folks that can only invest in AAA? You are not aware that your own firm argues for large AAA tranches? You are not aware that those BBBs that are turned into the AAAs through this process of CDO-ing them, that the reason for that is to have more AAA tranches and more AAA securities?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator----"
"Senator Levin","You are not aware of all of that?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I never marketed that. I don't--I mean, if you asked me whether I would think that it would be more desirable to have a AAA than a AA, I would say, for sure. If you are asking me whether I knew that some category is absolutely barred from buying it unless it had a AAA, it is just not within my--it wasn't within my scope to know that."
"Senator Levin","Well, then look at the top question here. When I said, ``Either based on your own knowledge''--that is the bottom of page 46--``and the opinions of your senior executives that they may have expressed to you, how critical did Goldman believe that the ratings given by the CRAs were to the successful marketing and selling of RMBSs and CDOs?'' Now we are talking the marketing and selling. How important is it? Your answer, ``I don't know what the standards--I don't know what drove the business. I don't know what drove the business. I don't know how important they were in the business to investors.'' You are telling us that you don't know that AAA ratings are important to investors? That is what you say in your deposition."
"Mr. Blankfein","Senator, I am not saying--you are using different language----"
"Senator Levin","I am reading it exactly. Based on what you know or the opinions----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I said I don't know the standards. I don't know what drove the business. I don't know what drove the business. I don't know----"
"Senator Levin","``I don't know how important they were in the business to investors.''"
"Mr. Blankfein","That is----"
"Senator Levin","You don't know how important AAA----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I can't say the extent to it. Senator, I am being asked a question in a deposition about a line of business that I never personally was in in my--I never did this in my life in the firm and I am being asked. There are so many people at Goldman Sachs who can answer this question with precision. I wasn't one of them."
"Senator Levin","That wasn't precision. That is the question. You don't know that those ratings are important to sales?"
"Mr. Blankfein","I said I don't know how important they were in the business to investors."
"Senator Levin","Oh."
"Mr. Blankfein","And that is--I don't know----"
"Senator Levin","Do you know that they are important?"
"Mr. Blankfein","Yes, I know that they are important, and I know that they be preferred--at the same price, by the way. But I don't know the extent to which those investors for a lower rating but a higher yield are capable of buying it. I just don't know."
"Senator Levin","The deposition was taken by staff, not by me, so when I said, I asked you something, it was the----"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry."
"Senator Levin","No, that was my statement. When I said, I asked you something, it wasn't me. It was the staff that asked you the question."
"Mr. Blankfein","I was taking it at the royal ``we.''"
"Senator Levin","I didn't say ``we.''"
"Mr. Blankfein","I am sorry."
"Senator Levin","I said ``I.'' Let me just close with a very brief statement. We have a debate going on here at this moment on how Congress should respond to the abuses that we have looked at in four hearings now. Those abuses include the conveyor belt of toxic mortgages that got into the financial system, huge demand for them that came from a whole lot of places. We focused on WaMu. We always focus on a case history and they were a very logical case history. So WaMu dumps, and others like them, dump billions of dollars of toxic mortgages into the system. Goldman and other banks like them provided these lenders with more money to issue bad loans. There is evidence, by the way, from the documents we came in with today that Goldman was very much aware that they were buying loans from companies that were selling bad loans, including New Century. Then the financial engineering comes along to turn those high-risk mortgages into allegedly safe investments, taking BBBs and other things that are not good, solid B's, turning them into ``safe investments'' through the magic of CDOs. Selling them then to pension funds, universities, municipalities, insurance companies, and banks. So now the poison spreads further. Then we have these synthetic securities, which magnifies all of that. The mortgage system begins to buckle under the weight of these loans and the synthetic stuff that floods the system. And then we have this situation where Goldman bets against the mortgage market as a whole, profits from its collapse. I know it was only a half-a-billion dollars in 2007, but amazingly enough there was a profit at all. The rare instance where despite all the losses that you took in your inventory and on the longs, you nonetheless were able to make a profit because of your huge investment on the short side. I happen to be one that believes in a free market. But if it is going to be truly free, it cannot be designed for just a few people to reap enormous benefits while passing the risks on to the rest of us. It must be free of deception. It has got to be free of conflicts of interest. It needs a cop on the beat and it has got to get back on Wall Street. Senator Dodd's bill is an important beginning, and we hope to strengthen it with provisions that address conflicts of interest, that address proprietary trading that puts a firm's self-interest ahead of its clients' interests. That is what we saw evidence of today. That addresses these synthetic instruments that magnify risk while gambling on the demise of companies instead of on their successes; that ends these reckless lending practices, such as stated income, which means liar loans, and negatively amortizing loans; that gives stronger enforcement tools for regulators to protect consumers. That is what we have got to do to rebuild the defenses to protect Main Street from the excesses of Wall Street and those other excesses that we have studied during these four hearings. I hope these hearings provide added strength to the reform effort. A lot of us will be working on legislation to stop the abuses that were exposed in these four hearings. We thank our staffs. They have worked extremely hard and extremely long hours. Elise Bean and our staff, and I know that this is true also of Senator Coburn's staff, have spent untold hours digging through these documents. I love the way some of your folks tell the press that the documents were cherry-picked. That book in front of you is a whole bowl of cherries. These are not cherry-picked. Those documents reflect the history of what happened here. From millions of documents, you obviously have to select some that you think represent a reality, and we did that. It is a reality which has some unseemly aspects to it, particularly in terms of conflicts. But we are just hoping that whether or not we can get the support of Wall Street firms, and you indicated some willingness to support reforms here today, but whether we get that support for a strong reform bill, we have to have the willpower and the backbone to do just that. We thank our witnesses. Mr. Blankfein, we thank you. It has been a long day. We thank all of the witnesses. And again, particularly, we thank our staffs. We stand adjourned.   "
