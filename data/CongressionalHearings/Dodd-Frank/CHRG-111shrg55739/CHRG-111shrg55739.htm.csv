Speaker,Speech,Type,Comments
"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order, and thank you, Secretary Barr, for being with us, and I thank my colleagues for being here this morning. The title of our hearing this morning is ``Examining Proposals to Enhance the Regulation of Credit Rating Agencies,'' and let me just say briefly--I want to make a few brief opening comments, then turn to Senator Shelby and, with the approval of my colleague from Alabama, ask Jack Reed if he wants to make a quick opening--he has done a tremendous amount of work on this, as has Senator Shelby, by the way--some opening comments on this as well. We had planned to do this at the subcommittee level, but there was such interest in the subject matter that we made it a full Committee hearing. I should just point out to my colleagues, beginning in March of 2006, under the leadership of Senator Shelby, we had a hearing in March on this subject matter, in September 2007, when I became Chairman, on the rating agencies. We had a hearing on the rating agencies April 22, 2008. We had hearings on March 10th and March 26th; they were broader hearings, but we spent a lot of time on the rating agency subject matter. So over the last 3 years--one, two, three, four, five--this will be the sixth hearing that focused a lot on rating agencies. This will be our last hearing before coming back in September, and I just want to thank not only my colleagues, I want to thank our staffs. We have worked it pretty hard on this thing here. This is, I think, our 29th or 30th hearing since January 20th, and just this week alone, we had two. We have had 15 hearings on this subject matter alone in the last 4 weeks. And I know that is exhausting for staff, who have worked very hard for these things, and Members, I know with all the other work we have and all the other discussions going on, but it has been tremendously worthwhile, and virtually all of these have been to try and determine what is the best course for us to follow as we try and craft what will be maybe the most important piece of legislation this Committee will deal with or has dealt with in decades, and that is the modernization of financial regulations. So it has been tremendously worthwhile, and I want to thank our witnesses as well, from the Administration as well as the private sector and academia and others who have come before the Committee. There are literally dozens who have who have shared their thoughts and ideas, and we are all very, very grateful for that input as we will now begin the process of trying to take those ideas and incorporate them into some sound legislative proposals. Senator Shelby and I are determined to have this be a very inclusive process. For all of our colleagues who are interested, you are invited to be at that table as we try and bring these ideas together and come out with a proposal that we all can embrace. And there will be points when we will have some disagreements, I am sure, but at least as I have listened to all of this, I think we are going to be in agreement far more than disagreement on matters, and I find that very encouraging as we go forward. So I wanted to share those thoughts, and I will ask the consent that the list of our hearings over 2009 be included in the record for those who may want to see it . On the subject matter before us today, let me just say that this hearing on rating agencies--and, again, others may have different views on all of this, but there are two areas, we all know, that share in culpability for all the problems that we have seen unfold in our economy. But two areas alone I think deserve special recognition for the problems. One was, of course, the failure to regulate these brokers who were out marketing and promoting products that they knew were going to create a problems, that there was no way the borrowers were going to be able to meet the fully indexed price of these mortgages, and yet were luring people into it, getting paid, and selling off, and, of course, covering themselves financially, but literally knowing full well that this was going to create a bubble that was going to come back to haunt us. And the second is the rating agencies. This is to me stunning in a way that agencies that hold themselves out--in fact, I was looking this morning, just sharing with Senator Shelby here, and I will not--this is not the witnesses before us today that it fits, but a major rating agency--and let me just read--this is the Web site this morning. This is not the Web site of 4 years ago. The top of the Web site, the name of the agency: ``Independent credit ratings, indices, risk evaluation, authoritative, objective, and credible.'' I mean, in a sense, first of all, risk evaluation, all they were doing is being paid by the very people they were rating. Never bothered to do due diligence at all to determine whether or not these products were as creditworthy as they were claiming to be. And yet still to this day it is suggesting somehow that they are independent, conducting risk evaluation at all. Quite the opposite. And so this is an area where I think there is a lot of shared views on what we need to be doing. You will hear about that. But I was just this morning asked to pull up this Web site, and once again find that, despite all that has been said, despite six hearings on the subject matter--and none of us have yet the simple, quick answer on how we move in a different direction. But, clearly, the present situation cannot last. So this is an area which will clearly be a part of our legislation and one that is deserving of some real attention in the coming days. But, again, I thank my colleagues for their work on this subject matter, and they ought to be--these companies need to be providing independent research and in- depth credit analysis on their Web sites, which is not the case today. So let me turn to Senator Shelby for some opening comments and then Jack Reed for any thoughts he has, and then we will get to our witnesses.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The nature of today's credit rating industry reflects decades of regulatory missteps rather than market preferences. Over the years, the Government granted special regulatory status to a small number of rating agencies and protected those firms from potential competitors. Beginning in 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission began embedding NRSRO ratings into certain key regulations. Once credit ratings acquired regulatory status, they crept into State regulations and private investment guidelines. The staff of the SEC controlled access to the prized National Recognized Statistical Rating Organization, or NRSRO, designation by subjecting potential entrants to a vague set of criteria and an incredibly slow timeline. The SEC did little to oversee the NRSROs once so designated. Nevertheless, because of the doors they open, ratings from an NRSRO became an excuse for some investors to stop doing their own due diligence that Senator Dodd alluded to. Widespread overreliance on ratings meant that the effects of poor quality or inadequately updated ratings could ripple through the markets. By encouraging reliance on a small number of big credit rating agencies, bureaucrats at the SEC exposed the economic system to tremendous risk. Our current financial crisis, which was caused in part by the credit rating agencies' failure to appreciate the risk associated with complex structured products, demonstrates just how big that systemic risk was. The troubles caused by the SEC's flawed regime, however, did not come as a surprise. Several years ago, when I was Chairman of this Committee, we acted to address the problem after the SEC failed to take action on its own. I felt then that the industry's heavy concentration and high profits were symptoms of an industry in serious need of reform. We then passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, as Senator Dodd mentioned. The act set forth clear standards for the NRSRO application process. It also gave the SEC authority to regulate disclosures and conflicts of interest, as well as unfair and abusive practices. Unfortunately, the law we passed in 2006 did not have time to take root before the problems that they were intended to remedy took their toll. The SEC adopted rules pursuant to that legislation in June of 2007. Over the following months, the number of NRSROs doubled, just as the performance of many highly rated subprime securities revealed that such securities were not as safe as the rating agencies said they were. Today, we will consider a legislative proposal by the Administration and others to revisit the regulation of credit rating agencies. In determining whether new legislative steps are required, I believe we should keep in mind that the 2006 reforms are still working their way through the system. That does not mean, however, that we should not consider further changes. Every option should be on the table. One option is to remove rating mandates from regulations. Another is materially improving disclosure. As with any regulatory reform, however, we must also be mindful of unintended consequences. I strongly believe that the credit rating agencies played a pivotal role in the collapse of our financial markets. Any regulatory reform effort must take that into consideration, and I believe we will. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Shelby. And as I mentioned, I want to commend our colleague and the former Chairman of the Committee. Senator Shelby really was early on involved in the subject matter. He and Paul Sarbanes I think worked together on that matter and did great work. He has been followed in that effort by Jack Reed, and I want to thank Jack publicly here for, as the Subcommittee Chair, dealing with these matters, and he has worked very, very hard in developing some legislative proposals which we invite all of our colleagues to take a look at and to consider as part of our overall financial modernization bill. But he has been tremendously helpful, and I want to again publicly thank Jack Reed for his work. Jack, any thoughts on this?",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for not only holding this hearing, but also your efforts to reform financial institution regulation. I particularly want to commend Senator Shelby because it was his leadership really in 2006 that first gave the SEC the clear authority to begin to regulate the credit rating agencies. In effect, the credit rating agencies are so central to investor decisions that it is comparable to the Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval. To expect a municipal finance director in a small town to be able to do due diligence, to make sure he has the AAA rating, is asking a lot. So we depend significantly on the rating agencies, and as evidence suggests, part of our current economic problems were a result of ratings that were not substantiated over the long run. What I believe we have to do is to give legislative support to the SEC's efforts to focus on transparency through enhanced disclosure, and also to counteract the appearance or substance of conflict of interest. And the legislation that I propose and in many respects that is reflected in the Administration's proposal would do that. There is one other issue that I have included in my legislation; that is, to change the pleading standard in securities cases so that a plaintiff could at least reach the discovery stage with respect to a credit rating agency to see if, in fact, their behavior was reckless. And we do not change the overall 10(b)-5 standard, which is a very, very high bar for liability. But effectively today, under the securities laws, it is very difficult for a plaintiff to even get to discovery to see what, in fact, went on with the rating. And I think this was something that we should pursue. Mr. Chairman, thank you and I look forward to the witnesses.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Reed, and we thank you again for your work in this matter. We look forward to your questions, again. And as I said at the outset, instead of helping people understand risk, it was hiding risk, in effect, too often and relying on the people who paid their salaries. And it has much to do with the market failure as anything else I can think of, the rating agencies, and the dependency that people had on them. So, clearly, there is a need for our attention. So, with that, Mr. Barr, Mr. Secretary, we look forward to your testimony.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby. It is a pleasure to be back here today with you and the other Members of the Committee to talk about the Administration's plan for financial regulatory reform. As you know, on June 17th, President Obama unveiled a sweeping set of regulatory reforms to lay a foundation for a safer, more stable financial system. We have sent up draft legislation for your consideration in most of the areas covered by that proposal, and in the weeks since the release of those proposals, we have worked with you and your staffs on testimony and briefings on a bipartisan basis to explain and refine the legislation. Today, I would like to focus on credit ratings and credit rating agencies and the role that they played in creating a system where risks built up without being accounted for or properly understood, and how these ratings contributed to a system that proved far too fragile in the face of changes in the economic outlook and uncertainty in our financial markets. This Committee has provided strong leadership to enact the first registration and regulation of rating agencies in 2006 under Senator Shelby's leadership, and Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, Senators Reed and Bunning have continued that tradition going forward. The proposals that I will discuss today build on that already strong foundation of this Committee's work. It is worthwhile to begin our discussion of credit ratings with a basic explanation of the role they play. Rating agencies solve a basic market failure. In a market with borrowers and lenders, borrowers know more about their own financial prospects than lenders do. And especially in the capital markets, where a lender is likely purchasing a small portion of the borrower's debt in the form of a bond or asset-backed security, it can be inefficient for all lenders to get the information they need to evaluate the creditworthiness of the borrower. Lenders will not lend as much as they otherwise might, especially to lesser known borrowers such as smaller municipalities, or they will offer significantly higher rates. Credit rating agencies provide a rating based on scale economies, access to information, and accumulated experience. At the same time, credit ratings played a key role, a key enabling role in the buildup of risk in our system and contributed to the deep fragility that was exposed in the past 2 years. The current crisis had many causes, but a major theme was that risk--complex and often misunderstood--built up in ways that supervisors, regulators, market participants did not, could not monitor, prevent, or respond to effectively. Rapid earnings from growth driven by innovation overwhelmed the will or the ability to maintain robust internal controls and risk management systems. Rating agencies have a long track record evaluating the risks bonds, but evaluating structured financial products is a fundamentally different type of analysis. Asset-backed securities represent a right to the cash-flows from a large bundle of smaller assets. Certain asset-backed securities also rely ``tranching''-- the slicing up of potential losses--and this process relies on quantitative models that can produce and did produce any desired probability of default. Credit ratings lacked transparency with regard to the true risks that a rating measured and the core assumptions that informed the rating and the potential conflicts of interest in generating that rating. This was particularly acute for ratings on asset-backed securities, where the concentrated systemic risk are quite different from the more idiosyncratic risks of corporate bonds and are much more sensitive to the underlying assumptions. Investors relied on the rating agencies' assessment of risk across instruments, and they saw those risks as remarkably similar, despite the complex and different securities underlying the assets. Ultimately, this led to serious overreliance on a system for rating credit that was neither transparent nor free from conflict. And when it turned out that many of the ratings were overly optimistic, to say the least, it helped bring down our financial system during the financial crisis. We do need fundamental reform. The Administration's plan focuses on a series of additional measures in three key areas: transparency, reduction of rating shopping, and addressing conflicts of interest. It recognizes the problem of overreliance and calls for reducing the ratings usage wherever possible. With respect to transparency, we would call first for better transparency in the rating agency process itself as well as stronger disclosure requirements in securitization markets more broadly. We would require transparency with respect to qualitative and quantitative information underlying the ratings so that investors can carry out their own due diligence more effectively. Mr. Chairman, I see that my time is up. Would you mind if I take a couple more moments to outline the key proposals?",Statement,STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. BARR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 
"Chairman Dodd","No. Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Second, the use of an identical rating system between traditional corporate bonds and structured financial products allowed investors to use their existing standards with respect to ratings and allowed regulators to use existing guidelines without the need to consider the different risks posed by structured and unstructured products. Our proposals address this directly by requiring that rating agencies use rating symbols that distinguish between structured and unstructured financial products. The first point, transparency. Second, on rating shopping, an issuer may attempt to shop among rating agencies by soliciting preliminary ratings from multiple agencies and enlisting the agency that provides the highest one. Our proposal would require instead that an issuer disclose all of the preliminary ratings it had received from different credit rating agencies, so investors could see how much the issuer had shopped and whether his final rating exceeded one of those preliminary rating. That should help deter rating shopping in the first place. In addition, the SEC has proposed a beneficial rule that would require agencies to disclose the rating history so that markets can assess the long-term quality of ratings. In addition, we strongly support a proposed SEC rule that would require issuers to provide the same data they provide to one credit rating agency to all other credit rating agencies to allow those agencies to provide additional independent analysis to the market and to improve the ability of competition in the marketplace in a beneficial, positive way. Third, with respect to conflicts of interest, strong new transparency requirements with respect to payments, we would in addition ban rating agencies from providing consultant services to issuers that they also rate, and each rating agency would be required to disclose the fees that they were paid for a particular rating, as well as the total fees paid to the rating agency by the issuer over the previous 2 years. Last, we need to strengthen and build on SEC supervision with a dedicated office focused on compliance and a requirement that the SEC evaluate the rating agencies' compliance with their own rules and their own methodologies. In conclusion, we all know that markets rely on faith and trust. We need to restore honesty and integrity to our financial system, and the plan that we have set forth before you for consideration would lay a new foundation for financial regulation that, in our judgment, will once again help make our markets both vital and strong. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you very much, Secretary Barr. We appreciate that very much. And let me just say we appreciate very much as well the Administration's continuing conversation with us in this Committee about your ideas. We welcome them. I know I speak for all of us here, Senator Shelby and I particularly. We look forward each week to the ideas that come up and the thoughts that are coming from the Administration, as well as from others. As I said earlier, this is a Committee that is open, and it is a dynamic process that we want to hear ideas as to how we ought to move forward. But let me begin by raising the issue of, given the problems caused by faulty ratings and the need for strong Federal oversight--I think we have all come to that conclusion. The question is how do you do this. We all recognize the problem. Now what is the answer? And there are a lot of different views on what the answer ought to be. In fact, I was just saying to Senator Shelby, I have talked to some people in the private sector who begin to raise the question of whether or not you even need ratings agencies. Today, given more transparency, the market in many ways could help you determine whether or not a given product is actually worthy of a AAA rating or something less than that. So there is an argument of saying maybe this is an archaic structure, although I do not believe that is a widely held view. There are those who embrace that view. But I wanted to share with you a view that has been held by some in direct conflict with the proposal that the Administration has given us, and that is to create a new office within the SEC to conduct the oversight of rating agencies. The Council of Institutional Investors' white paper that was prepared by Professor Frank Partnoy recommends creating, and I quote, ``a single independent credit rating agency oversight board'' to oversee registration, inspection standards, and enforcement actions related to the NRSROs, similar to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board for accountants. Such an independent board could offer higher salaries to attract staff with greater expertise. Others have observed that the regulation could be moved to a systemic risk regulator, authority. Please describe, if you would, how the Treasury determined which regulator among these options would be best to oversee the credit rating agencies. How is it you came to the SEC choice?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Mr. Chairman, I think that historically the SEC has had important functions in this area. This Committee's action under the leadership of Senator Shelby enhanced that authority to the SEC. We were attempting to build on that basic foundation in our legislative proposal. Under our proposal, the SEC could delegate some of those functions to the Public Accounting Board as a way of recognizing their expertise. In our judgment, the SEC is able to attract quite highly talented individuals in this area, and having a dedicated office focused on this would advance the mission.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I want to raise a question here with you, which I was stunned by the question because I just assumed that this went on, but apparently it does not. Credit rating agencies, I am told and they state, they do not undertake to verify the information that issuers provide them in making rating. This has led, obviously, to a perception among some that the rating agencies take the issuer's statements at face value and can choose to ignore other information they receive or are aware of about the issuers when producing a rating. Do you feel it would be appropriate to require rating agencies in formulating their ratings to consider information that they receive about an issuer and find credible from outside sources? What I find stunning is I just assumed that went on. I am told it does not. So this is sort of a--I am answering my own question. But tell me why you think there should be a different answer than the one that I am suggesting in my questioning.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I would never be so foolish.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I hope.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You should not feel shy. Others do all the time.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","So let me just say, we tried to draw a line in our proposal. We have tried to be quite clear that the Government should not be in the business of designing the methodologies for the rating agencies or validating them in any way, because we think that will just increase reliance on them. We have been quite clear that they need to disclose whatever due diligence they do so that there is transparency so that investors know when they get a rating--the rating company would say, ``We didn't do any due diligence on this rating,'' or the rating company would have to say, ``The due diligence we did consisted of calling our buddy.'' Or hopefully when the transparency kicks in, the rating agency would have to say, ``We did real due diligence. We had a third party, and they can certify they actually checked loan files.'' And I think that with that level of transparency, it will be very hard for--harder for rating agencies to continue a practice of--at least a mixed practice with respect to the kind of due diligence they have done.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You said something in the first sentence or two in your answer to my question that we do not want to dictate or require rating agencies to conduct their due diligence. Forgive me, but I do not understand what you are saying at that point. If we do not require them to do due diligence, if we do not require them to at least consider information, credible information that may contradict the information they are receiving from the issuers paying them, how can we have any confidence if we do not require that as a matter of public policy?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think there is room for lots of reasonable people to disagree about exactly where to draw the line on methodologies, Mr. Chairman, but I think the key principle is we want to be sure that there is transparency about whatever methods they used. We want to make sure that the SEC can examine whether the agencies have actually used the procedures they say they are using.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","They say they are using, they say they are relying on the issuer, the one who is paying them. They can have all the transparency in the world. You telling me that you are relying on that information and that constitutes due diligence does not give me a great deal of confidence.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","It does not give me any confidence, sir. I am not suggesting that. But I think that we should not inflate the confidence level that the rating agencies would have on the basis of that level of due diligence, and if the investor community can see, is required to be shown that the kind of due diligence that is being conducted is not really the diligence that ought to be due, I think it will have a significant salient effect on the process.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Secretary Barr, it would take a long stretch, wouldn't it, to bring a lot of confidence back into what we feel has been lost with the rating agencies, would it not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I would agree with that, sir.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Secretary Barr, S&P, Moody's, and Fitch have not, in most people's eyes, performed well in recent years. I think that is probably an understatement. Nevertheless, the SEC has ebbed a persistent confidence in these three firms--three firms--a sentiment that manifests itself in regulatory requirements that blessed the organizational structure, approach to ratings, and payment scheme of those firms. There seems to be similar bias in your draft legislation. I hope not. What steps, if any, did you take, you and your team, to ensure that no particular organizational structure, approached to ratings, or payment model was favored over another and that the regulatory structure will accommodate innovative entrance into the rating? I have always advocated, gosh, three firms nominate--they do not have it all, thank God, have all the business, but there has not been enough competition there. You know, why should you just bless three firms?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Shelby, we would agree with you there should be competition in this space, more entrants into the market. They should be done on a level playing field. We should have a diversity of approaches to a business structure so you have investor-pay and issuer-pay models that need to be accommodated in the system. And I think all that is absolutely critical.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Something has gone wrong. We both agree with that. And so what we are trying to do is have a basic new approach to it to try to bring more transparency, a lot of transparency, eliminate conflicts of interest and all these things that were so rampant in this business. Do we agree on that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, I think those fundamental principles are embedded in our legislation. We would be in agreement about that.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","How is the decision to leave the NRSRO ratings embedded in the regulatory framework consistent with the goal of not affording regulatory privilege to a large entity?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, I think that we share the goal of reducing reliance, both by private investors and by public regulators, on the rating system. And in our judgment, that requires methodically and carefully going through each way in which rating agencies' ratings are used by different regulators in different contexts. There may be some areas where you can reduce reliance. There may be other areas where you can eliminate reliance. There may be some areas where you can use the rating but you have to require--you should require judgment, independent judgment, on top of that. And each of those contexts is quite, in our judgment, specific. We want to work our way through it. We are committed to doing that. The President's Working Group of Financial Markets has a team that is looking at this issue, again, regulation by regulation.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Do you believe that one of the priorities at the SEC--one of the priorities, they have a lot--should be to straighten out the problems that we all deem necessary with the rating agencies?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think it is one of the top priorities in reform, along with making sure we have resolution authority----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Absolutely.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","----making sure we have a way of reducing systemic risk in the system and protecting consumers. So I think it is a critical part of the overall package.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Heretofore, one of the factors that led this Committee to act in 2006 legislatively was the fact that the NRSRO policy decisions were being made at the SEC at the staff level rather than the Commission level, as you well know. Freestanding offices at the Commission, such as the Office of Compliance, Inspections, and Examinations, have not always been subject to the same level of scrutiny as the main divisions. You propose an office to be created, as I understand it, at the SEC dedicated to the NRSRO supervision. How would you ensure here sufficient accountability to the Commission, to the Securities and Exchange Commission?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Shelby, that is an issue I would be happy to continue to work further with you and the SEC on. In our judgment, having a dedicated office would increase accountability to the Commission and to the Congress because you would know exactly who is responsible for that job.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","My last question, and my time is about up, you also propose--your proposal would authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to delegate reviews of NRSROs to the Public Accounting Oversight Board. What is the PCAOB's expertise that makes it uniquely qualified for this task, and would you recommend that the PCAOB Board be structured to reflect the new responsibilities?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, the----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","They are getting into a new field here, would they not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","There may be elements of supervision that could be delegated with respect to accounting methodologies and other matters, where they do have expertise. We have not considered restructuring the Board to accommodate that. I would view that as an available option to the SEC, but not integral to the proposal.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The issue that Chairman Dodd raised with respect to due diligence is embroached by the second panel, Professor Coffee and Mr. Joynt on behalf of Fitch. One suggests that we instruct--Professor Coffee--neutral clients and other institutional investors that they cannot rely on ratings to meet their fiduciary obligations unless there was, in fact, third-party due diligence. Mr. Fitch's approach is to ensure that the issuers and underwriters perform such due diligence. Do you have a position with respect to these two views or another view?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The Administration hasn't weighed in on the question whether there should be additional requirements outside of the rating agencies with respect to the purchasers of rated securitizations. I think that we would want to be careful, again, not to take steps that would suggest excessive confidence in the ratings themselves, and anything that we can do that improves due diligence by investors is likely to be in the right direction. But whether that needs to be a requirement on the purchaser or not, I frankly have not formed a developed view.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","One of the aspects of the legislation I proposed is to at least adjust the pleading standards and effectively, a private right of action would be, I think, a stimulus for a lot of due diligence. Is that your position?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","In our judgment, this presented a complicated question. On the one hand, the changing the pleading standard might increase the incentives for due diligence in the system. On the other hand, we were concerned that such a standard might increase reliance by the investor or public on the rating agencies and may provide further avenues for issuers to sue over corporate downgrades, which we thought would potentially pose a problem in the system. So in our judgment, this was a very close question and we did not include it in our legislative proposal.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Mr. Joynt, on behalf of Fitch, in his testimony says a mandatory registration concept--your concept--is unnecessary and unwarranted, is not consistent with basic free speech principles. And then Rapid Ratings' testimony predicts that the proposal will force compliance costs, raise barriers to entry of new rating agencies, and essentially impede technology and innovation. How would you respond to these, first, that mandatory registration is unnecessary, and second, to----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","In our judgment, the credit rating agencies shouldn't be able to opt out of having high standards and a level playing field. Consistent with our overall approach to financial regulatory reform, we don't think that financial institutions, credit rating agencies, or other participants in the system should get to choose their regulator or not. And so in our judgment, having high standards, a level playing field for competition was really important. I think, on the basis of the 2006 legislation, there is in place a system for encouraging new entrants into the credit rating agency process. Registration is not going to be a significant barrier to entry. We think competition is a good idea in this space if it is on a level playing field with high standards so there is no race to the bottom, the competition is based on everybody playing by the same rules.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Finally, Mr. Secretary, in the testimony of the succeeding panel, there is a question by Rapid Ratings about the rating symbol, distinguished between structured and nonstructured products. They suggest the problem is not that investors did not know they were buying structured products. They either knew and were happy to get the higher yield or they didn't understand the risks that they were buying. Essentially, the problem, they suggest, is not symbology, but accuracy. Again, how would you respond to that proposal?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think the rating of a structured product is a fundamentally different exercise from the rating of a corporate bond. The distinguishing features need to be noted. It is not just the symbol that is used, but the underlying availability of qualitative and quantitative information that we would require disclosure on. The package of those reforms, I think, will enhance transparency in the market and make it less likely that garbage ratings can be invented.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and Senator Reed, thank you for all of your effort in this regard. Mr. Barr, thank you for being here. You are a very pleasant guy and I am hoping that over time, we will get this all in balance. I want to say, though, just in listening to testimony, it just seems a little schizophrenic in that this was the biggest regulatory failure in 30 years, and in essence, regulators outsourced their regulation to three for-profit entities. I mean, that is really what has happened here. We obviously realized they were doing no due diligence and basically taking what the issuers were saying. In testimony in answering just a minute ago, you said that the Federal Government should not be in the business of designing what these guys do. But on the other hand, as it relates to consumer protection, you guys want to design the products that private companies are offering. I just find this almost an out-of-body thing. When we are looking at trying to fix the inconsistencies that led to this, on one hand, we are doing almost nothing but transparency, OK. On the other hand, we are getting into actually telling companies what products they are going to offer. This is just sort of an imbalanced approach, and I don't want to spend long on that, but I wonder if you want to rebut that at all.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, Senator. You and I have had this exchange on previous occasions. In our judgment, we are not suggesting that the Government is going to be in the business of designing products. The legislation provides the authority to say there is a product in the marketplace that is a standard product, a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage or a 5-1 ARM, and when a customer is being offered a pay option ARM, the mortgage broker should show them----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And I understand all that----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","----what a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage looks like. And so we are not in the business of designing that product, either. We are saying there is a product in the marketplace and it is the standard product. How do we judge those? We have, in that context, a large group of individuals who are not sophisticated investors, market participants. It is a fundamentally different context from the context of credit rating agencies, where the basic backdrop is the institutional investor market and sophisticated retail investors' participation. And so you would want to come up with standards that are appropriate to each of those marketplaces.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Well, I appreciate that. I do see, though, that you are basically keeping the same regulatory scheme and process and making people rely or pay for these. Let me go down a little different path. Eric Dinallo, who is the Insurance Commissioner in New York, or has been up until recently, suggested that instead of the kind of scheme that we have now, since insurance companies in particular rely heavily on ratings, that the insurance entities in these States should actually pay for the ratings and they should be made available to all. That way, if credit rating agencies don't perform properly, they would be discarded. But in essence, it would be a whole different way of looking at it. Now, that may not be perfect, but I am just wondering if that kind of thinking makes any sense from your standpoint.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I do think it makes sense to have a diversity of payment models and investor-pay models and issuer-pay models. I think investor-pay models have some downsides once the rating occurs. There are concerns that the investor would have incentives to avoid downgrades on their own holdings. But I do think having a diversity of views, a diversity of approaches within the same basic legal structure makes a lot of sense. I think we need to reduce reliance by regulated entities on ratings, but I think it is going to take the process a good bit of time to figure out how to replace that function in the regulatory structure with alternative judgments that can perform a similar function.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","You know, I have issued bonds in the past and have had rating agencies rate them. I do want you to know all of them were paid in full.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","But it is kind of an interesting process that you go through. I mean, you really do sort of look for the entity that is going to give you the rating, and then you pay them an up-front fee. And then, as the borrower, you sweat bullets ensuring you could pay everything back over time. I do wonder----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is very old fashioned of you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Yes. Thank you for that, actually.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I do wonder whether we should consider a different payment mechanism, where in essence the credit rating agencies have skin in the game over time. And then instead of being paid up front, they are paid based on how it performs. We have talked about that a little bit with mortgage brokers and others who have had no skin in the game. And I wonder if you might comment on that. And I think some folks, some colleagues in the other body, on the other side of the aisle, have actually been promoting something called covered bonds, where in essence, instead of getting all of this risk off banks' balance sheets, they in essence are in the game all the way through. I wonder if you might comment on those two, and thank you for your testimony. In spite of some of the differences we have, and there is not time to enumerate all those right now, I do look forward to working with you and others to come up with something that is in the middle of the road.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator. I think both suggestions hold out very good promise. One of the features of our legislative proposal would be to give the SEC authority to require trailer payments of the kinds that you have described for credit rating agencies. I think it is a terrific suggestion. And I think there is also enormous work that can be done with covered bonds. It is not going to be a replacement for securitization, but I think it is an additional promising avenue we would be happy to work with you on.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know a lot of my colleagues have brought up a number of the failings of the rating agencies, and clearly, in some of the products lines recently, that has been the case. This is perhaps non-PC, this point, but there has been value from the rating agencies. I think back in my tenure as Governor, and I think Senator Johanns would agree, there was sometimes validity in the rating agencies when you were looking at State bonds and others, that they did provide that independent arbiter service to kind of cut through the political clutter of both sides back and forth so somebody could come in and to some level of diligence, at least, assess what your State was doing or your locality was doing over a short-term or a long-term basis. We did find usage of the rating agencies, that they did do due diligence, something that clearly I find what the Chairman and Senator Reed and Senator Shelby said is pretty amazing, as well, that they did not in so many of these corporate circumstances--although again, the idea of legislating that requirement, I think, Mr. Barr, you have raised some appropriate concerns about, because would that enhance, put that Government moral hazard thing that we all don't want to extend to a whole new set of organizations in terms of the rating agencies. I want to ask two questions. One is, we have had mostly the issuer-paid funding model. The Administration's proposal is that an investor-paid funding model. I know certain investor- paid models are starting. Do you really think that marketplace approach, with the investor-funded rating agencies--I am asking you to make a prediction here now--do you think it will be successful? Do you think the market will respond to that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think there is an opportunity, Senator, to have a structure that has both models, investor-pay and issuer model, exist and thrive if there is the appropriate regulatory backstop of a level playing field. I think that the initiative to require an issuer to provide the basic information to all credit rating agencies when it provides it to one, so there can be true dissemination of information, true competition, will help significantly in this regard if moved forward. And having a level playing field for that kind of competition on the basis of high standards and meaningful disclosure, I think there is an opportunity for that model to work. I think, frankly, we have so many challenges right now in restarting our financial markets, our securitization markets, and in laying a new foundation that it is not clear yet----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I didn't make a prediction, and I do understand this question of whether we should be blessing the methodologies. It is a real hard issue. Let me, with only a minute-and-a-half left, go to my other question. You know, one of the things that we use these terms, Triple-A, Double-B, what have you, but one of the things that I have felt that investors have not had, and I am not sure I have had as somebody who has been on the issuer side and on the investor side, that we have ever kind of translated that into, all right, what does that mean in terms of the actual percentage chance of default, number one, or the second category, even if there is a default, what percentage of my investment could be truly in jeopardy, and should we, as we think about these terms, think about at least putting some commonly accepted standards around for investors. You have got a Triple-A. What is your percentage of default risk? What percentage of your investment are you potentially going to lose--ten percent, 50 percent, 100 percent? We have started to talk a little bit about here between structured products and unstructured products, but should we actually try to translate these letter-grade ratings into actual percentage of risk of default or risk of amount of loss?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, Senator. I think that is absolutely critical to demystifying the process, making it more transparent. In our proposal, we fully agree with you. There should be, in addition to the rating, a report that describes the probability of default, the loss given default, the variance, the reliability of the data, the underlying quality of the asset, all the information underlying the symbol so that investors in the market can make better judgments about how to evaluate the rating itself.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","We would know what a Triple-A rating equates to, what a Double-B rating equates to in terms of both percentage chance of default and, you have got $100 invested, what percentage of that $100 you could lose if that default takes place----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is right, and on an individual securitization basis, so you would be making a judgment----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","All the way down to an individual securitized----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Very good question, Senator. Thank you very much for your thoughts on that.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Barr, good to see you again.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Good to see you.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","I will say something that I think you will find very unusual. My colleague from Virginia was talking about working with the rating agencies as Governor. In our State, the State of Nebraska, we have no debt. I never worked with a rating agency in all the 6 years I was Governor because it wasn't relevant. We paid for everything, even highways. So that is one way of approaching this. Then you don't need rating agencies. Kind of an unusual phenomena that to pay for things, you would actually have two choices, cut spending or raise taxes, and we could use more of that out here in Washington. But I did work with rating agencies as Mayor of Lincoln as we would issue bonds. Let me ask you a little bit maybe of a mundane question, but maybe an important question. As you know, there has been, especially recently, some articles written about First Amendment protection for rating agencies. Historically, it was viewed that they were issuing an opinion and therefore they had the protection of the First Amendment if they were sued. As you move down this pathway of additional regulation or, as Senator Corker points out, maybe rating agencies need to have some skin in the game, if you will, do you have any thoughts whatsoever about whether that moves a rating agency out from underneath the First Amendment protection? What would be your thoughts on that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, let me start by saying I am not an expert in the First Amendment, so my judgment, the judgment of the team when we were working on this was that there is lots of scope for appropriate regulatory requirements on the rating agencies, including all the ones that we have in our legislation and a number of the other proposals this Committee has considered that do not raise significant First Amendment concerns.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","So you think they would--and I appreciate you are not a First Amendment lawyer. I am not, either, even though I am a lawyer. But you are thinking that they still will be able to defend their lawsuits by saying, we are protected by the First Amendment because this is an opinion?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, I don't want to get too deep into this here, again, because I am not an expert in the First Amendment, but in our judgment, the range of proposals that we have put forth or that are in the Committee drafts of versions of this do not raise significant First Amendment concerns, in our judgment.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","And so I would not have put that on the top of the list of issues and the tradeoffs that we have been discussing. I do not think that that is a significant issue in the tradeoffs.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","OK. In your judgment, how have the rating agencies worked historically? We all know nothing was working very well over this past period of time, but historically, if you were to look at how they have done, what kind of mark would you give them?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think in many areas, the rating agencies have performed quite important functions with respect to corporate issuance of municipal bonds. In many areas, they have significantly fallen down on the job in those same basic areas--corporates and municipals, sort of really quite straight-forward assessments that they have been significantly wrong on. And in the structured product area, I would say the evidence is really quite negative.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Here is my concern, and maybe it is a question based upon what Senator Corker was asking you again. But it seems to me that one of the risks that we run here is that we so gum up this system with additional regulations that, number one, no one could ever enter into competition. If you don't have a head start dealing with regulations, you are just not going to get in. So we exclude competition. And then the second thing is, I just worry that what we end up with is literally a system where the consumer pays a heavier price for this. Somebody has to pay for the regulation. There just isn't any doubt about it. Have you done any cost-benefit, any analysis of the impact on just the average guy out there who may be investing a bit of their retirement or whatever and the impact this will have?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, I think, unfortunately, the whole country is paying the price. Every consumer is paying the price today of a significant failure of our financial regulatory system. So we are all paying for it now in spades. I think we need to have a system in the future in which the level playing field and high standards are established in a way that makes it much less likely we are going to blow up our financial system and cause this amount of harm to the average American homeowner, consumer, small business person. So in our judgment, the tradeoff isn't even close. The kind of approach that we are suggesting here is not a heavy regulatory burden, but it is an essential one.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Johanns. I think it has been valuable, by the way, to have two former Governors, two former mayors on the Committee. And while I think there is a difference, obviously, in terms of rating agencies when it comes to municipal or public bonds as opposed to private securitizations, nonetheless, it is a valuable piece of information as we look at this, because obviously, when we talk about rating agencies, there is a tendency for all of us to focus in on the private side of this. But we ought to keep in mind the public entity side of this question, as well, and I hadn't really given that much thought. I am glad you raised it, as did Senator Warner and Senator Corker. Senator Merkley, you are up next.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for your testimony. I believe that the proposal bans consulting fees by rating agencies and requires disclosure of payments. Certainly banning consulting fees addresses part of the conflict of interest. We still have kind of the fundamental notion that folks are getting paid for what they provide and the possibility of shopping between agencies and kind of getting a heads up on if we did purchase it, what your rating might be. So anything that we need to do that is kind of more fundamental in terms of having a different system for structuring payments for rating, doing it through a central fund that the folks pay into or some other--is there any ideas you have seriously considered that would more directly take on the conflict of interest?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Well, I think, Senator, we think conflicts of interest did play a role in this problem. We have a series of measures with respect to the banning of consulting payments, strengthening disclosure and management of conflicts, disclosing the fees paid by issuers, a look-back requirement with respect to the revolving door to make sure that revolving doors haven't influenced these structures, designation of a compliance officer, disclosure of the preliminary rating received to get at the rating shopping question that you described. And I think, fundamentally--and we share Senator Corker's judgment that having trailer payments could play a positive role in the basic structure. Having a diversity of different business structures, both investor-pay and issuer-pay models, together with a requirement that the information provided to one agency is provided to all the others, will have a significant impact on the conflicts problem. It won't eliminate it, but it will have a significant impact.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","All those are very good and well, but you didn't answer the question I asked, which was did you consider----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I tried.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","----changes in more--that went more to the heart of the structural conflict of interest of having the payments go directly from the bond issuer to the--and if you rejected such ideas, what did you consider and why did you reject them?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We looked at a range of models that had been proposed, from switching back to a full investor-pay model. We looked at the utility model that had been suggested. We looked at the roulette wheel model of using rating agencies that had been suggested. In our judgment, each of those suffered from some significant infirmities. If you used the utility model, for example, you are really just enshrining the rating agencies even more in the process and putting a Government seal of approval on them. If you use the roulette wheel model, you are reducing the incentives for meaningful competition and for better ratings. If you go fully to an investor-pay model, it is not obvious that the resulting conflicts are going to be, on balance, better. And so our judgment was, better to have a diversity of payment schemes out there. Let us have a level playing field with competition, but on the basis of serious high standards. And let us provide information that is given to one agency to all the agencies so that there is a chance for them to show that their competitor isn't good at doing a rating.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Thank you. That is helpful, and I will have my team follow up to try to get a better understanding of the weaknesses of those other possibilities. We have in the structured products world very complex CDOs and CDO-squared that made it virtually impossible for anyone to determine the underlying foundation for what went into a CDO- squared, and by that I mean situations where you had BBB bonds that you dedicated 60 percent of the revenue and suddenly you had AAA bonds coming out of the BBB portfolio, et cetera. And yet you are so far removed from whether they were liar loans, whether the loans had been thoroughly vetted in terms of the income of the individual, et cetera--underwritten, if you will. So is there a level of complexity that should simply be banned in the interest of reducing systemic risk? Is there a level of slicing and dicing that gets to where you really cannot create--it is too messy, the path is too messy from the buyer back to the foundation that essentially they do not make sense to allow in the marketplace?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think there are ways of getting at the basic problem of complexity in alternative strategies than a flat ban. So, for example, the securitization ``skin in the game'' requirement improved transparency in the securitization structure that we have proposed requirements with respect to transparency at the loan level for all investors in the underlying asset with respect to, say, a borrower FICO score, what broker originated the loan, what the compensation scheme was, all of which are designed to get at that set of concerns, and better qualitative and quantitative information underlying the rating on such a structured product would permit investors to go underneath and say, well, the reason that they have assigned this rating is because their view of the cash-flow distribution in the waterfall was this, their loss probability measurement, their loss severity measurement is that. And it is a way of unpacking the complexity into its component parts.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","I appreciate your response. I am picturing what that sort of report might have looked like on some of those CDO-squared. It may have in itself----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I would not want to write it.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","I am over my time, and so thank you very much. Senator Reed . Thank you, Senator Merkley.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Barr, before getting into the subject of today's hearing, I have a question on a different matter. Yesterday, the Wall Street Journal had a front-page article about a meeting last Friday where Secretary Geithner attacked independent bank regulators for expressing their concern about Treasury's regulatory reform proposal. Were you at that meeting?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","If you were, was the article accurate about what happened at the meeting?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I do not have the article in front of me, Senator. I would say we have an ongoing series of conversations with the financial regulators on a regular basis. We have frank and direct conversations with them on a regular basis.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","If I give you the article, would you refresh your memory?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I am happy to look at the article. I am trying to describe for you the discussion, if I could.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","All right. Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The conversation that we had with them, the Secretary made clear the regulators are free to defend their own agency prerogatives. They are independent agencies. He expected that they would. He asked that they keep in mind, as they did that, the fundamental goals that we all share to protect consumers, to address systemic risk in our system, to make sure the Government had the tools they need to resolve financial firms in a crisis, and as they expressed their differences that we work together in the areas where we do have agreement. We had a long conversation about the important roles of the council versus the independent regulators. We had a long discussion about micro prudential versus macro prudential regulation. It was the kind of conversation that we have had with them on many occasions.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","The same type of discussion from Secretary Geithner and you with the regulators that you have had in the past.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I will not characterize the exact verbiage that was used, but I would say that the frankness of the exchange--",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","We are on television. I do not think you want to do that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, you know, you will not be surprised to learn that in Treasury, as occasionally up on the Hill, there is some colorful language that is sometimes used.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","I have been accused of that. I understand that completely. OK. Let us get to the current thing. Everybody agrees that the current rating agency model has failed--I think everybody up here does--especially for complex structure products. There also seems to be agreement that better competition will improve ratings. How we get better competition is a little more difficult question, but we must break the hold of the top two or three agencies if we are going to fix the ratings. It seems to me that there are two changes that will go a long way to fixing the competition problem. First, we should eliminate any regulatory requirements to use rating agencies so that they will only be used if they add value. Second, we should require issuers to provide the same information about the securities to all investors and rating agencies, much like we do for publicly traded companies with regulatory FD. That way each agency will be able to compete based on the quality of their ratings, and we will break the monopoly of the issuer-pay model. Let me start first with the first point, that we should eliminate all requirements to use rating agencies. Do you agree with that or not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","In our judgment, we need to go regulation by regulation. We agree with the basic goal of reducing reliance wherever possible. I think we need to go into the specific circumstances of how the SEC and the bank agencies and other agencies use the ratings. In some contexts, we can go to elimination. In other contexts----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","You do agree that there is a definite conflict of interest presently?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I am sorry. In the rating agency structure?",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","When I would go to a rating agency--I am a private corporation. I come to a rating agency. I need $200 million in bonds. They say, ``Yes, we will do this.'' They give me a BBB rating, and then they send me a bill for $250,000 for that rating. Don't you think that is a conflict?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I do think there are serious conflicts of interest present in the existing model. That is why we require a series of steps to reduce the conflicts, disclose the conflicts, manage the conflicts. We strongly agree with your suggestion that an issuer be required to provide information when it gives it to one agency to give it to all the credit rating agencies. I think that is a terrific proposal. It is part of our plan.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Now, about the second point--and I am a little past my time--that all investors and rating agencies should have access to the same information about a security so they can perform their own analysis of it, do you agree with that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think when----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","You just said that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I am sorry. Yes, when you give one rating agency the information, you should give it to all the other rating agencies as a way of enhancing competition. I do think that that is an important part of the plan.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Do you think that it is absolutely necessary for an agency to rate every security or bond that is sold to the public entities? In other words, I am the city of Louisville, I am building an arena, and I apply to the IRS for a portion on it to be tax free, and I go to this agency and they say, ``Well, we cannot do this.'' And all of a sudden someone intervenes, and all of a sudden they found their ability to do this. And I think that is absolutely the wrong way to do business. For, you know, a half-a-million dollars we get $4 million worth of bonds that are 80 percent tax free and 15 percent taxable. Do you think that is the right way to run the business?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think there are enormous inefficiencies in our revenue bond system in the United States of which the rating process is one, but there are many, many others.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Senator Bunning. Senator Schumer is next. He stepped out. Senator Shelby, do you have a question?",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I will just--do you believe, Mr. Secretary, that eliminating the conflict of interest--it is obvious to me and a lot of other people--by the rating agencies where they get paid for rating things, so to speak, and the cozy relationship there is very important in our regulatory overhaul?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think we have to tackle the conflict of interest head-on. I am not sure we can fully eliminate it, but I think we have to address it.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","How do we bring back what I thought we all benefited for a long time, and that is, securitization of mortgages? For years and years--I would not say every mortgage, you know, but there was as lot of confidence in the securitization process, and the securitization process basically worked. It basically worked. Now it is, for all intents and purposes, very small, if not dead. How do we do that? Do we do it with covered mortgages? Do we do it with stringent ratings and trailing profits like Senator Corker alluded to earlier, or what? How do we do this? Because I do not know if the money is ever going to flow until we bring some confidence back into securitization. Maybe I am wrong.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Shelby, I think it is a central question. I think that, in our judgment, one of the reasons it is so critical to move on financial regulatory reform this year is precisely that. I do not think we are going to see a revitalization of our securitization markets unless we have a new foundation of regulation that permits transparency in the system, restores honesty and integrity to the process that was so sorely lacking in the last bit of time. So I think that, in our judgment, we need to move quickly on financial regulatory reform. We need to have transparency in the securitization structures. We need to improve regulation of credit rating agencies building on the 2006 law. We need to make sure we take care of the systemic risk problem and consumer protection. And we really have to move in a way that it is demonstrable to the markets that we are serious about reform.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing. Thanks, Secretary Barr, for coming. Thanks, Senator Shelby, for asking that extra question. I appreciate it. I have a little statement with a little proposal in there, and I am going to ask your opinion of it. We had hoped, when we passed the Credit Rating Agency Act of 2006, the reform act of 2006, which required registration and oversight of credit rating agencies, that the rating agencies would be one of the cornerstones of strong credit markets. Instead, as has been said before, the credit rating agencies turned out to be one of the weakest links, and those need to be fixed, as you just said. What we found out was that rating systems were filled with conflicts of interest. The worst of these conflicts were that issuers went shopping for ratings like they were shopping for used cars. If they did not like the answer they heard, they went somewhere else. Because the revenues of the rating agencies grew with the massive expansion of the securitization market, the rating agencies had every incentive to help issuers structure their products to get the ratings they wanted. The result: Rating agencies rubber stamped complex products they did not understand as investment grade, using flawed analytical models and methodologies with inadequate historical data that did not include the possibility of high mortgage defaults. We cannot overestimate the impact this had on the financial crisis. Losses in structured finance securities alone led to $1.47 trillion in writedowns and losses at the largest financial institutions. And Senator Reed, our Chairman here, has introduced a bill on credit rating agencies, and the Administration has proposed new rules to address some of these conflicts of interest and the inability to evaluate ratings. And they are important proposals, but I wonder if the message is getting through. Last month, I read an article how Moody's downgraded--after Moody's downgraded a collateralized debt obligation because the default rate of loans in the CDO rose 7 percent. Morgan Stanley repackaged it into new securities with AAA ratings. How can you get a AAA rating based on a CDO that has just been downgraded six levels? Where are the checks in the system? That is why I am proposing, in addition to Senator Reed's bill and the Administration's proposal, which I think are very good, that for every ten rated products, the SEC would randomly assign a different rating agency, another rating agency to issue a second rating. I understand that issuers get two ratings, but this randomly assigned rating agency would act as a check on the first rating agency. Furthermore, this check would help discourage ratings shopping and other conflicts of interest inherent in the system. We would learn who is better at ratings and who is worse and get rid of at least the conflicts of interest. I would not want to do it for every issue. That is too many, but just a certain amount. We propose one out of ten, maybe it should be a little less, a little more, but a significant amount so we get a pool of knowledge. And I think it would be prophylactic. If an agency knew that there was a one in ten chance when they got paid by the issuer that someone else was doing an independent rating, they would be more careful. So the ratings are too much a part of our financial system to abandon them, but it is clear the system as it exists is broken, and I want to look forward to working with Chairman Dodd, Senator Reed on his excellent proposal, and the Administration to make sure that we can have faith that a AAA rating means what it says. So my only question to you, Assistant Secretary, is: What do you think of this proposal of having the SEC randomly assigning a second rating agency? That would be done, by the way, concurrently with the first and come out at about the same time.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Schumer, thank you for your longstanding work in this area. I would say we share the conceptual goal of having more than one agency rate issuance, particularly--it is a particularly acute problem in the structured finance area, but it exists elsewhere. In our proposal, we suggest that one way to do that consistent with the direction of the SEC's proposal is to require that every issuer provide full information about their issuance to all the other credit rating agencies as a way of enhancing competition in the rating. There are significant incentives on the competitors to want to demonstrate their own prowess in rating in relation to their competitor who has been selected. I think that one tradeoff that one might consider with respect to an assignment process is whether that assignment might provide a kind of seal of approval to the rating that would not be intended, it would be counter to the general thrust of what the Committee has been trying to do in this area. So that might be a competing concern on the other side with mandatory as opposed to competition for the rating.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Yes, but, OK, two points I would make. My time is up. But, number one, it would be done on a random basis and secretly, number one. And the pool would probably be a lot greater than just the Big Three. So you would have new entries with some incentive to just get it right and get it honest. And, second, your proposal, of course, is not mandatory, and simply giving the information, if everyone is in the same boat--and just a few of them doing the same practice might prove to have the same discouraging effect of sort of paying for a good rating. That is what I would say. My time is up, but I would certainly want an answer----",Speech,

"Mr. Joynt","Thank you, Senator Reed, Senator Shelby, Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to appear at the hearing today. I would like to spend a few minutes summarizing my prepared statement. While overall macroeconomic conditions remain difficult, it seems the period of the most intense market stress has passed. This is due to both a variety of Government initiatives here and abroad aimed at restoring financial market stability as well as actions taken by companies individually to shore up their balance sheets and reduce risk. Having said that, important sectors in the fixed-income markets remain effectively closed, and certain asset classes, such as commercial mortgage-backed securities, are experiencing greater performance strain on their underlying assets. During this time, the focus of Fitch Ratings has been on implementing a broad range of initiatives that enhance the reliability and transparency of our opinions and related analytics. More specifically, our primary focus is on vigorously reviewing our analytical approaches and changing ratings to reflect the current risk profile of the securities that we rate. In many cases, that continues to generate significant numbers of downgrades in structured securities, but also affects other sectors, such as banks and insurance. We are releasing our updated ratings and research transparently and publicly, and we are communicating directly with the market the latest information and analysis that we have. In parallel, we have been introducing a range of new policies and procedures--and updating existing ones--to reflect the evolving regulatory frameworks within which credit rating agencies operate globally. In each of these areas, we have been as transparent as possible, broadly engaging with all market participants, including policy makers and regulators. I am happy to expand on these topics as we proceed. That said, the focus of today's hearing is clearly on where do we go forward from here. Senator Reed has introduced a bill, which we are happy to speak to. The House held a hearing in May. The SEC, I think, considered important new rules at their roundtable discussion in April. There is a Treasury proposal that we will speak about, and also outside the U.S., we have been in discussions with the EU, and they have recently enacted a registration and oversight system as well that applies to rating agencies. As this Committee considers these topics, we would like to offer our perspective on several important issues. Let me reiterate that we are committed to engaging on all of these matters in a thoughtful, balanced, constructive, and non-self- serving manner. At the same time, some perceptions and proposals continue to circulate that could use clarification. Transparency is a recurring theme of the discussions about rating agencies, and at Fitch, we are committed to being as transparent in everything we do. All of Fitch's ratings' supporting rationale and assumptions and related methodologies and a good portion of our research are freely available to the market in real time. We do not believe that everyone should agree with all of our opinions, but we are committed to ensuring the market has the opportunity to discuss them. Some market participants have noted that limits on the amount of information that is disclosed to the market by issuers and underwriters has made the market overreliant on rating agencies, particularly for analysis and evaluation of structured securities. The argument follows that the market would benefit if additional information on structured securities were made broadly and readily available to all investors, thereby enabling them to have access to the same information as mandated rating agencies in developing their own thinking and research. Fitch fully supports the concept of greater disclosure of such information. We also believe that responsibility for disclosing that information should rest with issuers and underwriters. It is their transactions, and they should be disclosing all the pertinent information to all investors. A related benefit of additional issuer disclosure is that it addresses the issue of rating shopping. Greater disclosure would enable nonmandated NRSROs to issue ratings on structured securities if they so choose, providing the market with a greater variety of opinion and an important check on perceived ratings inflation. Discussion of additional information is of questionable value without accuracy and reliability of the information. That goes to this question of due diligence. We have taken, rating agencies, a number of steps to increase our assessments of the quality of the information that we are provided with, and we have adopted policies that we will not rate issues if we deem the quality of the information to be insufficient. The burden of due diligence, in my opinion, though, belongs with issuers and underwriters. Congress should mandate that the SEC enact rules that require issuers and underwriters to perform such due diligence and make public their findings and enforce the rules that they enact. In terms of regulation more broadly, Fitch supports fair and balanced oversight and registration of credit rating agencies and believes the market will benefit from globally consistent rules for credit rating agencies that foster transparency, disclosure of ratings and methodologies. We believe that oversight requirements should be applied consistently and equally to all NRSROs. One theme in the discussion of additional regulation is the desire to impose more accountability on rating agencies. While ultimately the market imposes accountability for our ratings, for the reliability and performance of our ratings and our research, if the market does not have confidence in us, the value of Fitch's franchise will be diminished. While we understand and agree with the notion that we should be accountable for what we do, we disagree with the idea that the imposition of greater liability will achieve that. Some of the discussion on liability is based on misperceptions. Rating agencies today, like accountants and officers and directors and securities analysts, may be held liable for securities fraud to the extent rating agencies intentionally or recklessly make material misstatements or omissions. Beyond the standard of existing securities law that applies to all fundamentally, we struggle with the notion of what it is we should be liable for. Specifically a credit rating is an opinion about future events, and the likelihood of an issuer that he might meet his credit obligations. Imposing a specific liability standard for failing to accurately predict the future strikes us as an unwise approach. Congress should also consider some practical consequences of imposing additional liability. They were mentioned earlier. Expanded competition might be inhibited from smaller agencies, but that may be addressed. All rating agencies also may be motivated to just try to provide the lowest securities ratings just to mitigate liability, which does not encourage accuracy. I see I am past my time.",Statement,STATEMENT OF STEPHEN W. JOYNT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FITCH RATINGS 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Joynt. Let me also say that all your statements will be made part of the record, and if you would like to summarize them, that is perfectly fine. And the statements of the Members will be made part of the record. Mr. Gellert, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","Thank you. Senators, thank you for inviting us to join you today. Rapid Ratings is a subscriber-paid firm or otherwise known as an investor-paid firm. We utilize a proprietary software-based system to rate the financial health of thousands of public and private companies and financial institutions quarterly. We use only financial statements, no market inputs, no analysts, and have no contact in the rating process with issuers, with bankers, or with advisers. Our ratings far outperformed the traditional issuer-paid rating agencies in innumerable cases such as Enron, GM, Delphi, Pilgrim's Pride, the entire U.S. homebuilding industry, and others. Currently, we are not a NRSRO. We have not applied for the NRSRO status, and we do not have immediate plans to do so. At present, there are too many mixed messages coming from the SEC, Treasury, and Congress for me to recommend to our shareholders that the designation is in their best interests. Of course, the Treasury proposal's requirement that all ratings firms must register is an unwelcomed development. It runs counter to the goal of positive change for the industry, not to mention elements of the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006. We do believe that reform in our industry is necessary and must happen with a sense of urgency. But we caution that, if not done properly, this reform may have counterproductive and unintended consequences. We also believe that competition in this industry, and the level playing field for current and new players, is essential. Equivalent disclosure of information is needed. Rules that do not disproportionately penalize small players are needed. An environment where the new innovate and where the old can have their behavior modified is needed. All should be primary goals of legislation. The SEC has been wrestling with new rules and rule amendments and has made some headway in areas curbing the issuer-paid conflicts. We do not agree with all of the elements of the SEC's initiatives, but the Commission has taken some positive steps to stop the more egregious behavior of the issuer-paid agencies. As detailed in my written submission, our views on the new Treasury proposal are not quite as balanced. Together, the SEC and Treasury initiatives are positively addressing rating shopping, conflict and fee disclosure, transparency issues, and are at least flirting with removing the NRSRO designation from SEC regulations. For our complete comment on these, again, I would like to refer you to our written submission. On the critical side, the recent Treasury proposal, despite its positives, threatens to erect more hurdles to competition in this industry, further solidifying the entrenched position held by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. A few items. Methodology disclosure: Rules in the Treasury proposal on transparency of ratings methodology could come dangerously close to meaning ratings firms would have no intellectual property protection. Ratings disclosure: Requiring subscriber-based rating agencies to disclose their history of ratings and ratings actions can undermine the subscriber-based business model, which is predicated on selling current and past ratings to investors. The Treasury proposal covers all types of rating agencies and for 100 percent of their ratings. This erects a major barrier for subscriber-paid firms by interfering with their revenue model. Requiring NRSRO registration: Requiring registration of all companies issuing ratings is perhaps the most counterproductive initiative of all. Not only does forcing registration run counter to the 2006 Act, it could create a flood of new NRSROs captured by the sweeping dragnet. Investors will not have the inclination to look at all of these firms and will tend to remain with the providers they know best, the Big Three. Further, registration would impose all of the increased direct and indirect costs on firms that would otherwise choose not to be an NRSRO. This will force some out of business, it will create disincentives for new entrants, and it will stifle potential innovation and positive competition. So the Treasury proposal would require firms to register, subject them to high compliance costs, put at risk some firms' intellectual property, and hinder their revenue-generating ability. All in all, regulatory protection for S&P, Moody's, and Fitch, and anything but a level playing field. The Big Three agencies have lobbied heavily to promote the notion that one-size-fits-all regulation is fair because all business models carry conflicts of interest and that theirs is no worse than any other. Can conflicts occur in other business models? Sure, theoretically. Have conflicts in subscriber-paid models contributed to any financial disasters? No. This red herring cannot drive new legislation. The problem is not the potential behavior of the subscriber-paid rating agencies. Rather, it is the misbehaviors of the issuer-paid rating agencies that have already occurred. Effective legislation and regulatory framework must focus on reforming the issuer-paid model and the model's most negative features, providing oversight of the NRSROs that prevent the self-interested behavior that contributed to the current financial crisis and creating an even playing field for competition. The latter has two major components, fostering, or at least not inhibiting, new players, methodologies, and innovation; and equivalent disclosure of data used by issuer- paid agencies. For true reform to have a fighting chance, these themes must be protected by the legislative framework for the ratings industry. We must be critically aware of how the unintended consequences of poorly implemented regulations can leave us with a broken system that has proven it is not so deserving of protection. Innovation and responsible alternatives to a status quo have been hallmarks of the American financial system. These should be fostered by those looking to return confidence and integrity to this industry. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF JAMES H.

"Senator Reed","Professor Coffee. STATEMENT OF JOHN C. COFFEE, Jr., ADOLF A. BERLE PROFESSOR OF",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I am honored, Chairman Reed and fellow Members of the Committee, to be back before this Committee, but I am in the very embarrassing position of having to begin by commending and congratulating the Chairman, because what we are looking at in the Treasury bill is 95 percent what was in the Reed bill. The Reed bill, introduced in April, was substantial, constructive, well crafted, and I think it does just about everything that you can do through administrative regulation to deal with this problem. The problem is, there are dimensions to this whole area that are beyond simply administrative regulation and that is what the Treasury bill in particular leaves out. Thus, because--there is a shortfall, because not all of the provisions in the Reed bill are in the Treasury bill and because there needs to be a consideration of some issues beyond administrative regulation. I would have to say there is a shortfall in the Treasury regulation, and I would have to predict that we will see a persistence of the status quo, dysfunctional and perverse as it is, if all we do is what is in the Treasury bill. In this regard, I think there are two distinctive critical features about credit rating agencies which distinguish them from all of the other gatekeepers in the financial markets that have to be focused on. One, credit rating agencies do not perform due diligence. Accountants are bean counters. They go out and count the beans. Credit rating agencies give ratings based on hypothetical assumed facts, and thus you are getting hypothetical ratings. I think that has to be corrected. Second, the credit rating agencies today do not face any meaningful risk of liability. Because, as I look at the future, even though I wish to encourage the user-pay system, I think the issuer-pays model will persist and predominate. There is going to remain a built-in conflict of interest, and when you have a built-in conflict of interest, the other professions have found that the only thing that keeps the professional honest is the threat of litigation. The accountants have learned, painfully, how to steer a course between acquiescence to the client and maintaining high integrity and litigation is one of the forces that maintains that equilibrium. Therefore, based on that diagnosis, what do I think we should do? I think the first thing we have to focus on is how to encourage third-party due diligence. The Treasury bill does this, largely adopting many of your provisions. The problem is that it does this by requiring disclosure when you decide to use a third-party due diligence firm, and it requires certification by that firm to the SEC. That raises the cost of using a third-party due diligence firm and I think there would be many underwriters, at least if we get back into a bull market at some point in the future, that will simply opt not to use the third-party due diligence firm. They did this in the past. These due diligence firms were widely employed in the 1990s, and as the market grew bubbly, they dropped their use because they kept learning disquieting facts that they didn't want to hear about. So you can put in boilerplate disclosure that says, we are not using a third- party due diligence firm, and hope that in that more favorable market, you can get away with this, and I think you probably would be able to get away with this. How, then, should we deal with encouraging third-party due diligence? I would suggest that we look here at a different level of regulation. No one has been talking much about regulating the users of this information, and the users now are closely regulated by rules that I think are over-broad and ill conceived. Let me give you one example. Rule 2(a)(7) of the SEC under the Investment Company Act tells money market funds that they cannot buy securities unless they are eligible securities, and to be an eligible security, you have to have a requisite rating from an NRSRO rating agency. We could deregulate much of that, but many of the users of this information do want to rely on an NRSRO rating. They have made that very clear to the SEC. What I think we should say is that to the extent you choose to rely on an NRSRO rating, it has to be a rating that is based upon third-party due diligence that verified the essential facts. That way, we have at least something that is not illusory, that is not a hypothetical rating, and that way-- because this rule already exists. I am not proposing new rules. I am proposing making the existing rule meaningful by making it based on third-party due diligence. There are other of these rules, but they are in my statement and I won't take it further. The point in doing this is by focusing on the user, we are not regulating the rating agency and that allows us to sidestep some arguable constitutional problems about whether we are overly regulating commercial speech. I don't think we are, but we aren't doing it at all if we regulate the user and say, you only get the right to do this if you use one of these techniques and you have good due diligence. Now, let me move on to this issue of liability because I see the business-pays model as persisting. I think we need some risk. In 10 seconds, let me just say that my proposal is not to open the flood gates. It is really your proposal. I think you struck a very sensible compromise, because it doesn't really increase the likelihood of litigated outcomes. It simply says, your proposal, your bill in April contains a provision that says if credit rating agencies--they can be found to have acted recklessly if they give an opinion, a rating, without conducting some due diligence or receiving due diligence from a third-party expert. This does not subject them to liability. It just tells them there is one easy, safe strategy for avoiding liability and that is to make sure that the underwriter pays for and gives you a third-party due diligence report that covers the critical facts in your model. This will not produce a rash of litigation. It will produce behavior that avoids litigation and thus this is another technique to get the critical core of due diligence back into the ratings process. Thank you. I apologize for overstepping my time.",Statement,LAW, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Professor Coffee. Professor White.",Speech, 
"Mr. White","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Members of the Committee. My name is Lawrence J. White. I am a Professor of Economics at the NYU Stern School of Business. During 1986 to 1989, I was a board member on the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on this important topic. I have appended to the statement for the Committee a longer statement that I delivered at the Securities and Exchange Commission's roundtable on the credit rating agencies on April 15, 2009, which I would like to have incorporated for the record into the statement that I am presenting today. The three large U.S.-based credit rating agencies--Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch--and their excessively optimistic ratings of subprime residential mortgage-backed securities in the middle years of this decade clearly played a central role in the financial debacle of the past 2 years. Given this context, it is understandable that there would be strong political sentiment, as expressed in the proposals by the Obama administration as well as by others, for more extensive regulation of the credit rating agencies in hopes of forestalling future such debacles. The advocates of such regulation want figuratively to grab the rating agencies by the lapels, to shake them and shout, ``Do a better job.'' This urge for greater regulation is understandable, but it is misguided and potentially quite harmful. The heightened regulation of the rating agencies is likely to discourage entry, rigidify a specified set of structures and procedures, and discourage innovation in new ways of gathering and assessing information, new technologies, new methodologies, new models, including new business models, some of which have been talked about earlier this morning, and it may not even achieve the goal of inducing better rating from the agencies. It may well be a fool's errand. Ironically, it will also likely create a new protective barrier around the incumbent rating agencies. There is a better route. That route starts with a recognition that the centrality of the three major rating agencies for the bond information process was mandated by more than 70 years--it goes back to the 1930s--of prudential financial regulation of banks and other financial institutions, in essence, regulatory reliance on ratings, in essence, an outsourcing or delegating of safety judgments to these third- party credit rating agencies. For example, the prohibition on banks holding speculative bonds, as determined by the rating agencies' ratings, imbued these third-party judgments about the creditworthiness of bonds with the force of law. This problem was compounded when the SEC created the category of Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization, NRSRO, in 1975, and then the SEC subsequently became a barrier to entry into the rating business. As of year-end 2000, there were only three NRSROs: Moody's, Standard and Poor's, and Fitch. It should thus come as no surprise that when this literal handful of rating firms stumbled, and stumbled badly, in their excessively optimistic ratings of the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities, the consequences were quite serious. The recognition of the role of financial regulation enforcing the centrality of the major rating agencies then leads to an alternative prescription. Eliminate the regulatory reliance on ratings, as Senator Bunning suggested earlier this morning. Eliminate their force of law, and bring market forces to bear. Since the bond markets are primarily institutional markets, as Assistant Secretary Barr mentioned earlier today, and not a retail securities market, where retail customers do need more help, market forces can be expected to work, and the detailed regulation that has been proposed would be unnecessary. Indeed, if regulatory reliance on ratings were eliminated, the entire NRSRO superstructure could be dismantled, and the NRSRO category could be eliminated. Now, let us be clear. The regulatory requirements that prudentially regulated financial institutions must maintain safe bond portfolios should remain in force. That is terrifically important. But the burden should be placed directly on the regulated institutions to demonstrate and justify to their regulators that their bond portfolios are safe and appropriate, either by doing the research themselves or by relying on third-party advisors who might be the incumbent rating agencies, or might be new firms that none of us have discovered yet, but could come forth in this more open environment. Since financial institutions could then call upon a wider array of sources of advice on the safety of their bond portfolios, the bond information market would be opened to innovation and entry and new ideas in ways that have not been possible since the 1930s. Now, my longer statement goes into greater detail, but since it was done on April 15, before the Obama administration's proposals were proposed, I just want to mention a few things about those proposals. I will be very brief, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE J. WHITE, LEONARD E. IMPERATORE PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Professor.",Speech, 
"Mr. White","Again, it is understandable they want to do something, but I think the efforts go in the wrong direction and the dangers are substantial because they are going to raise barriers to entry and reduce innovation, reduce the possibility of new ideas. Something that is especially dangerous is something that Mr. Gellert mentioned a few minutes ago: the requirement that all credit rating agencies, whether you are just an independent guy offering some advice to a hedge fund or whether you are a fixed-income analyst at a financial services firm, must register as an NRSRO. This strikes me as something that is going to discourage entry, discourage those new ideas, and that can't be a direction we want to go. So let me just say again that the proposals really are wrong-headed and that we really do have a superior route to go, which is a greater reliance on the market for information which an institutional bond market can use and use effectively.

"Mr. Froeba","Senator Reed, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee, my name is Mark Froeba. Thank you for giving me this opportunity to talk about rating agency reform. Let me give you a brief summary of my background. I am a 1990 graduate of the Harvard Law School. Barack Obama was 1 year behind me. What a difference a year makes.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MARK FROEBA, J.D., PRINCIPAL, PF2 SECURITIES EVALUATIONS, INC. 
"Mr. Froeba","In 1997, I left the tax group at Skadden, Arps in New York where I had been working in part on structured finance securities to join the CDO group at Moody's and I worked there for just over 10 years, all of that time in the CDO group. Since the beginning of the subprime crisis, there have been many proposals for rating agency reform. Most of them are well intentioned. However, few seem likely to accomplish real reform. Real reform, in my opinion, must achieve two clear policy goals. It must first prevent another rating-related financial crisis like the subprime crisis, and it must also restore investor confidence in the quality and reliability of credit ratings. In my opinion, the rating agency reform provisions of the Investor Protection Act of 2009 are not sufficient in themselves to accomplish either of these goals. However, the Act's rulemaking authority could be used to expand their effectiveness. Why are the reform provisions in themselves, in my opinion, insufficient? First, they are not the product of a complete investigation into what actually happened at the rating agencies. Without a proper investigation of what happened, not conducted on a theoretical level or in discussions with senior managers, but with the analysts who actually assigned the problem ratings in question, we cannot be sure the proposed legislation provides solutions designed to fix the problems. The best way to illustrate my second reason for questioning the sufficiency of this proposal is to ask you a simple question. If the Investor Protection Act of 2009 had been enacted just as it is 5 years ago, do you think it would have prevented the subprime crisis? In my opinion, the answer to this question is no. That does not mean that the proposals are bad, it just means that they do not advance what should be the central policy goal of reform, preventing a future crisis. If these proposals are uncertain to prevent a future crisis and restore confidence in credit ratings, what reforms could achieve these goals? I have, you will not be surprised to hear, six proposals, and I am going to speak really fast or skip some. First, put a firewall around rating analysis. The agencies have already separated their rating and nonrating businesses. This is fine, but not enough. The agencies must also separate the rating business from rating analysis. Investors need to believe that rating analysis generates a pure opinion about credit quality, not one even potentially influenced by business goals, like building market share. Even if business goals have never corrupted a single rating, the potential for corruption demands a complete separation of rating analysis from bottom- line analysis. Investors should see that rating analysis is kept safe from interference by any agenda other than getting the answer right, and the best reform proposal will exclude business managers from involvement in any aspect of rating analysis and critically also from any role in decisions about analyst pay, performance, or promotions. Second, prohibit employee stock ownership and change the way rating analysts are compensated. There is a reason why we don't want judges to have a stake in the matters before them, and it is not just to make sure judges are fair. We do this so litigants have confidence in the system and trust its results. We do this even if some or all judges could decide cases fairly without such a rule. The same should be true for ratings. Even if employee stock ownership has never actually affected a single rating, it provokes doubt that the ratings are disinterested and undermines investor confidence. Investors should have no cause to question whether the interests of rating agency employees align more closely with agency shareholders than investors. Reform should ban all forms of employee stock ownership, direct and indirect, by anyone involved in rating analysis. The same concerns arise with respect to annual bonus compensation and 401(k) contributions. As long as these forms of compensation are allowed to be based upon how well the company performs and are not limited to how well the analyst performs, there will always be doubts about how the rating analyst's interests align. Third, create a remedy for unreasonably bad ratings. Essentially, expand the liability of the agencies. I am going to skip my discussion of that because some of that discussion has already occurred. My fourth proposal is to change the antitrust laws so agencies can cooperate on standards. When rating agencies compete over rating standards, everybody loses. Giving them the capacity to get together to talk about rating standards may expand our ability to prevent the kind of problems that we have had. Imagine how different the world would be today if the agencies could have joined forces 3 years ago to refuse to securitize the worst of the subprime mortgages. My other proposals are to create an independent professional organization for rating analysts, and also to introduce investor-pay incentives into the issuer-pay framework, neither of which I have time to discuss, but they are described in my statement. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Froeba. Thank you all. This has been a very, I think, informative panel. Let me pose a question to all the panel members. I think I know Dr. White's answer.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","The Investor Working Group chaired by former SEC Chairman Donaldson and Arthur Levitt has recommended that myriad statutes and rules that require a certain investor to hold only securities with specific ratings should be eliminated over time to clarify that reliance on a rating does not satisfy due diligence efforts. I think Secretary Barr suggested that in one of his responses, and this is an issue, frankly, that Senator Bunning has raised directly, which is the reliance on these ratings, and the Secretary suggests that on a case by case, they were going to walk through the statutes. Just your reaction, Mr. Joynt, and down the line.",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","So this has come up in the SEC hearings, as well, and my response there, the same response today, which is I think it is healthy to go back and look at each of the regulations individually. I think it would not be helpful to have some kind of a blanket dismissal of all uses of ratings and regulations. I think, and I have been around a long time, I can think of why some of those ratings were put into regulation and they were for positive and constructive reasons, to try to limit risk and to be used as handy benchmarks for other regulators and boards of directors and other things. But to not go back and look at them, I think is a mistake. To look at them may help eliminate some of the use of ratings in regulation or even update them, because ratings have changed over time. They don't necessarily all mean the same things to all the same people. I still believe, though, that if ratings were eliminated in regulation, they will be often and frequently used by many institutional investors, boards of directors, and investors, because I believe they have value independent of whether they are forced to be used by regulation.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","I think looking at removing the NRSRO designation and regulations is actually quite a good idea. I agree that they can't all just be stripped out immediately because that can be disruptive, but looked at in a methodical way relatively expeditiously is probably a benefit. I think the Treasury plan calls for a 30-month review of this. I think that is probably a bit more time than anyone really needs to get started or at least to be able to make the statement that this is a road we are marching down. But I would point out that it is not just that there is a tendency for institutional investors to overrely, or a potential for them to overrely and essentially outsource their own credit work. It presents an opportunity to arbitrage the system, because a security that meets a certain standard by their regulatory oversight but has a higher yield, as we saw during this crisis, is something that they can buy and will buy because it is beneficial to them for returns. So, in a handful of ways, it can be complicated, but I do think it is a good initiative.",Speech,

"Mr. Coffee","I was sort of discussing this in my remarks, because I gave you the example of Rule 2(a)(7), which says money market funds, you can only buy eligible securities and they have to have an investment-grade rating from an NRSRO. I would change that. I would change it in the following way. I would not wholly abolish the rule, because we can't dare deregulate all money market funds that came this close to failure last fall. There have to be some restrictions. Professor White also, I think, agreed with that. I would give institutional investors----",Speech, 
"Mr. White","There you are, putting words in my mouth again, Jack.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Anyway, I would give institutional investors a choice. They could do it themselves. They could say, we are going to conduct our own due diligence and we will have our own prudent man fiduciary obligations when we do that, or we can rely on a credit rating, but only a credit rating that is supported by due diligence so that the critical facts on which the model relies have been verified by someone who is a professional. I know what will happen if given this choice. All of the smaller institutions would prefer to rely on the rating agency because the SEC proposed this last fall, and when they proposed this, they nearly got assaulted with pitchforks by the institutional investor community, which said, we don't want to take personal liability. But I think they should have the choice. I think to encourage competition, we should say, you can do your own form of due diligence, but you have greater legal responsibility if you do it yourself, or you can rely on those NRSRO ratings which are supported by legitimate verification. Given that choice, I think the world will be better off and I think it would encourage some competition.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Professor White, I think I know where you come down on the big issue, but let me pose a slightly different question, and if my time runs out, we will do a second round, but I want to recognize Ranking Member Shelby. There is an economic, I think, advantage, particularly for a small entity, that the Treasurer of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, who wants to make an investment, to have something that is shorthand, you know, triple-A, A-minus, et cetera, and I would think systemically and throughout the economy that the rating agencies have provided some value over time. It is not just a complete sort of desert out there. So just the issue of--I mean, I think the approach is sort of sequentially looking where we can change, and then a final point tying into what Professor Coffee said is that even if we eliminate the requirements, the presumption would be that issuers would still probably be paying and that, given the choice, most people would go to the rating agencies. So just your quick comment on that.",Speech, 
"Mr. White","All right. Thank you, Senator. First, you know, your larger issue, the larger question you asked about should we strip out the regulatory reliance on ratings, and my short answer is, as my grandmother would have said, from your lips to God's ear, or perhaps President Obama's ear. But let me now address the issue you just raised. When I advocate eliminating regulatory reliance, first, it can't be done overnight. That is right. Of course, you need notice and comment, et cetera. But also, it would be replaced by placing the direct burden on the bond manager at a bank, at a pension fund, at a money market mutual fund, to justify the safety of his or her bond portfolio. That is terrifically important. And the bond manager justifies the safety of the bond portfolio to the regulator either by doing the research him or herself, but not everybody is going to be able to do that, especially the smaller institution, or relying on an advisor. The advisor could be one of the incumbent rating firms. It might be a paid consultant. It might be a special advisory firm that comes into the market. Of course, that reliance ought to be approved by the regulator, but you open up the process. Now, those money market mutual fund responses to the SEC's proposals, ah, they were bleating and saying, oh, not us. Not us. We couldn't do the research ourselves. OK, fine. You can't do the research yourself, but if you don't even have the expertise to be able to figure out who is a reliable advisor and who is not, you shouldn't be running a bond fund in the first place and the SEC ought to use its regulatory powers to remove somebody who does not have the expertise even to figure out who is a reliable advisor or who is not. Again, this is an institutional market. It is not a retail market.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Froeba. I have a question, but it will be in the second round. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Joynt, one of the issues that was identified by the SEC staff in last year's report on credit rating agencies was that the growth and complexity of complex structured products overwhelmed the rating agencies. What steps have you taken to ensure that the next complex product--and there will be some-- that is sold in the financial markets does not outpace perhaps your firm's analytic capabilities in the way that the CDOs and the CLOs did?",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","A complex question, but in today's market environment, there is very little in the way of new complex instruments being issued. So in some way we have sort of a time to reassess. Some of the most complex instruments in the markets, CDO- squared and CPDOs, I think we took almost 6 months to analyze CPDOs before deciding that we could not rate them with our highest rating, and that was a very difficult process of analysts, modelers, and experienced people with judgment trying to think about the subjective aspects of the risk. It was mentioned earlier ratings have reflected the probability of loss, but some of these products where it was more important to think about the severity of the loss, how much you might lose when they go bad, and ratings were not and had not and have not been structured to address that, and maybe they need to be. We are working on that now as well. So I would say we have a healthy degree of skepticism about the complexity of the instruments. Today we have been asked to rate some resecuritizations that were mentioned earlier as well. We have only been willing to rate one class of security rather than tranche securities because in the tranching process they are creating strips that, if the probability of loss is wrong, you will have great severity. So we are uncomfortable assigning ratings of that type today. So today I would say we are pausing and reassessing how we do the analysis and what the ratings mean.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","OK. Professor White, you pointed out that credit rating agencies include disclaimers with their ratings, telling users not to rely on credit rating agencies in making investment decisions. Likewise, the SEC has directed money market funds not to rely solely on ratings by Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations in making their investment decisions. Does the fact that regulations require ratings send a signal that contradicts these disclaimers?",Speech, 
"Mr. White","It sure sounds and looks like a contradiction to me. On the one hand, you have regulations that say pay attention to the ratings, and on the other hand, you have the kind of disclaimer--I will quote it directly. This is the S&P disclaimer. ``Any user of the information contained herein should not rely on any credit rating or other opinion contained herein in making any investment decision.''",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Well, why do you want them then if----",Speech, 
"Mr. White","Well, I do not know whether to laugh or cry, and that is why I would step away, and say ``do not rely.'' If you want to voluntarily do so, fine, and you get to decide. Since you are an institutional investor, you have some memory, you have some judgment. You can figure out who has been the reliable provider of information, and who has not; who has the business model that you can trust and who, oh, I am not so sure. That is something that institutional investors should be expected to be able to do.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Professor Coffee, do you have a comment on that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Well, my great fear is that the status quo will persist, and the way in which it is most likely to persist is if we deregulate some of these rules, what we will get is most institutional investors continue to rely on NRSRO ratings, figuring that is the safest if they ever were to get sued. What I think we should do simultaneously is give them more options. Let them do it themselves or go to consultants. But to the extent that they are relying on the NRSRO alternative, we should upgrade that alternative by insisting on due diligence so it is not an illusory opinion. That way you give them more options, but they are higher-quality options.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Professor White, Mr. Joynt defends ratings as a common, independent risk benchmark that should be retained in regulations. Do the failures of the rating agencies over the last several years call into question their value as a benchmark?",Speech, 
"Mr. White","Even the executives of the ratings agencies acknowledge they made mistakes, they stumbled badly. So certainly over the past few years, they have not been very good. Quite honestly, I am agnostic about the whole issue of what business model, whether it is investor pay or issuer pay, is the right model. I think that is something that the institutional bond investor can figure out. It is important to remember that the issuer-pay model had been around for 30 years, from the early 1970s, and really there had not been major problems.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","What happened?",Speech, 
"Mr. White","And then comes the whole structured finance market where there are only a handful of issuers, only a handful of NRSROs that the issuers can go to. The money is very good, and they stumbled, they succumbed. They got careless.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Greed?",Speech, 
"Mr. White","Greed was there all the time. But there was concern about reputation before, and somehow that got swamped. The model failed this time around. But it worked for 30 years. That is why I am agnostic. This is something that institutional participants can figure out on their own, with oversight by the prudential regulators to make sure that at the end of the day they have safe and sound bond portfolios.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Is it possible that ratings for certain instruments, such as more traditional bonds we have talked about, have a greater value as benchmarks than ratings provided for more complex and newer structured products, such as CDOs and CLOs?",Speech, 
"Mr. White","They are clearly simpler to rate. The entities are more transparent, and the problems were fewer. So, yes, certainly the history tells us they were better benchmarks.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Gellert, I have a question for you. You note that the inclusion of ratings in regulations, quote, your language, ``has given the Big Three a de facto legal and statutory power over many institutional investors and other financial institutions.'' You recommend that references be removed from regulations. We have been getting into this. Do you believe that the Government's removal of ratings from its regulations would create incentives for the private sector to conduct better or greater due diligence?",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","I think it absolutely will. Just outside of the legal liability issue, there will be the marketing issues and the investor reporting issues for these institutions, because the focus will come on them to understand better what types of credit work they are doing internally. This ability to arbitrage the system would go away to some extent. But there is no question that by embedding, really the Big Three's, but the NRSROs in various regulations gives them undue power over the investment decisions and risk management decisions of the institutional investor community.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","How do we bring securitization back? How do we do this? I mean, it is based on trust, and maybe it is a brick at a time. But it worked so well for so long. Professor Coffee, do you have a comment?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think this is a case where innovation was corrupted. We had a much simpler kind of asset-backed securitization in the 1990s----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","And it worked, didn't it?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","It worked better when it was simpler. Once we started bringing in the CDO-squared, no one could understand it. And if there is one rule I would suggest to you, it is that if it is too opaque to be understood, it really should not be issued. And I think the market is going to insist on that. We will probably have simpler kinds of asset-backed securitizations which are more credible and which the rating agency can more credibly signal and sample the quality of the underlying collateral. Otherwise, we will see frozen housing finance----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Without that, there is no trust out there, is there?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","There is no trust because everyone can see that no one understands this, including the rating agency.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank each of you for your testimony. I really think it has been most enlightening. I think each of you have shed a little different light on the issue, and I really appreciate that, especially on this issue. Mr. Joynt, you probably deserve a badge of courage in showing up. I want to thank you for that. And I also want to thank you for taking time in your offices to walk through the issue with us. I know that in a market economy this has affected you guys downwardly. I know a lot of employees have left the firm as a result just to less work, and I know this is not a good time for rating agencies. But I want to ask this question. If you listened, I think we were all sort of shocked that there was no due diligence really performed, and I think each person has alluded to that in a different way. What is the value proposition that the credit agencies, the three large ones, provide the public?",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","So the dialogue about due diligence, if we focus on corporate issuers, I think if you think about the rating agencies that have recently started up or become NRSROs, almost all of them are focused on corporate issuers. None are focused on structured finance, Realpoint only on CMBS. I think that is because there is disclosure of good information; they are able to do ratings and get investors to pay. They do not need any special information. So that is the process I think about when I think about securitization and structured finance as well. There should be enough public disclosure for many rating agencies, and investors also, to be able to use the public information, that it should be reputable, that an issuer and/or his banker has put together as a part of arranging a financing. And so I see them as having the due diligence. The function of the rating agency, Fitch's rating agency, is to analyze that information, think forward about the potential risk of default and ramifications for investors, and try to order that for investors through our rating system, and then publish our research that tells them all the factors. I think that function--which allows many investors that cannot analyze the wide variety of financings that we can because we have a staff of 1,900 people--and I think that provides a valuable function. So it should not be the only thing that investors should be looking at. I certainly agree with the idea that investors are responsible for their own analysis.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So one of the things we talked about in your office was really to focus on the toxic asset issue, which has kind of come and gone, but how do you actually value those? That is where we spent most of our time. And you guys shared with me that you could tell by zip codes what the default rates were going to be and all of those kinds of things. So moving away from the corporate side and looking at the CDOs and these other instruments we are talking about, those kind of things were not done on the other hand when you rated these particular securities. Is that correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","No. For mortgage-backed securities, that is the kind of analysis we would do. We would not go out and verify the individual loan information provided in the package. But in looking at the history and frequency of defaults and severities and problems, we could do that as a part of our modeling. Unfortunately, the history is not representative of what was going to happen and has subsequently happened.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","But on those, then, understanding that you look at corporate financial statements and those kind of things, but on these other types of asset-backed securities, it is hard to understand, in fairness, what the value proposition is that you offer if they are not really being offered by a company and you are not actually going out and checking the parts of the country that they are being offered from. It is hard to understand that there is really any value proposition that is being offered by the credit rating agency.",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","I do not see it that way, so I think originators and servicers put together financial packages and package them into transactions that we can look at the companies, the origination, the servicer, the accounting firm that signed off on their financials, and try to think about whether those are representative of what is being presented and then analyze that compared to the history and what we would project the losses to be.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So it is really more--the companies, of course, have no skin in the game. They are out of there after it is done, mostly. I know some of them have kept pieces, but the companies--so when you look at the companies, they are not standing behind it like might be the case with a covered bond. So----",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","That is true.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","But I do not think they are not--it has not been my experience, although we have had quite bad experience that some of the large important financial institutions doing securitizations are not appreciative of the fact that their name is on the securitization if they would have originated the product. And so I think they are quite involved and/or are servicing the product. So I believe they have--not all firms, and some firms, of course, have entirely disappeared, so obviously they were doing quite a poor job and either did not care about their reputation or just failed.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I am going to ask one more question if that is OK. We are going to miss Senator Bunning in about a year-and-a- half.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","What makes you think I will be missed?",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I am going to miss you. The whole issue, I think one of the things that we have talked about some in the past is the business model, and that is that in the event you actually had to do due diligence and have these third-party efforts take place--which, by the way, I think should have to happen if somebody is going to rely upon it. But, in essence, it would really price you ought to the market in a way, would it not? Would you speak to that a little bit? And if you had to really do due diligence and you had to really know what was in that package, you could not charge the fee that you now charge and make any money. And I think you alluded to that in our conversations that that would be very problematic.",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","Well, we are not staffed in that way to go audit or check every one of the loan packages put together on every single family loan that would go into a financing. So we are not staffed that was at all. We are not staffed with a national network of auditors or even a system of local auditors. So that is certainly true. For CMBS, it is a little bit different where we have been able to send analysts to look at large properties. We are still not conducting what--I am very careful about this word ``due diligence'' around lawyers, because I am not a lawyer, but we certainly conduct an amount of diligent investigation into what we are looking at for individual properties in commercial real estate. But for consumer assets, broadly spread, we have used a more actuarial approach, assuming that the facts in the files are correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And everyone on the panel agrees that there should be no regulatory mandate to have to use, even State government, city government, any type of government entity should not be mandated to have to have a rating to buy a security. Does everyone agree with that? Everybody agrees with----",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think that there could be other options.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","But we should not build in having to use credit rating agencies and automatically causing people to believe that some work was actually done, due diligence-wise?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think that what some of us are saying is that you could certainly have alternatives that did not involve the use of an NRSRO agency. But to the extent that there already is this reputational capital out there in the public's mind and they are going to want you to have an NRSRO rating, some of us want to make that real and not illusory by insisting on due diligence. And that due diligence, to answer your earlier question, would probably be paid for by the underwriters. If the underwriters could get this market jump-started again, they would be happy to pay the cost of due diligence.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you all. I appreciate it.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Corker.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. Five minutes turns into 10 in a big hurry up here, and that is the only reason--since some of us have another meeting to go to. This is for anyone who would like to answer it. During the housing boom--the boom--rating agencies rated mortgage-backed securities without verifying any of the information about the mortgages. If they had, maybe they would have detected some of the fraud and bad lending practices. Do you think rating agencies should be required to verify the information provided to them by the issuer? And I am going to give you a caveat. The first mortgage that I ever took, I had to take three of my Federal tax returns in with me to verify that I had the income that I wrote on my application. You do not have to do any of those things right now, and I am asking if you think we ought to have a little more verification of what is on the list that the person who is looking for the mortgage at the time--and that is how we got into all this mischief with mortgage-backed securities being sold into the market without any verification, even though they were AAA rated.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Let me say you are right, Senator. You probably wanted to hear that. You are right. And I have some charts in my statement that show that the percentage of liar loans, no- document and low-document loans, in subprime mortgages went from in the year 2001 about 28 percent to the year 2006 about 51 percent. That is a very sharp jump, and no one noticed because no one really wanted to look. The loan originators had no interest because they got rid of the entire loan.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","But the Federal Reserve was responsible for overseeing the banks that made those loans, and/or the mortgage brokers, we gave that power to the Fed and just because they did not write any regulations, we ran into all this mischief. And so the housing bubble and the bursting of it was caused by some not doing their homework.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Again, you are right, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, I do not want to be right, because we are in a hell of a mess. If we were to require issuers to disclose information to all rating agencies, should that disclosure apply to securities that have already been rated so that we can get more opinions on the toxic securities already in the system? Please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","The short answer is yes. The percentage of new issues, particularly in the structured business now, is infinitesimal compared to what is outstanding and on people's books. So back to your prior questions of how do we get the securitization market moving again, we have to be able to provide to the market greater insight into what is already out there. And to just provide the detailed due diligence information and supporting information of structured products that come to market today is insufficient. And I would just add that one of the areas that gets short shrift when we discuss structured products is the collateralized loan obligation asset class. It is equally if not more important than the CDOs and other securitized, or structured products, and the information availability is much smaller. And it is much more tightly controlled by the rating agencies that currently do rate----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","I only have 5 minutes. I am not trying to cut you off, but I want to ask--because do you think--this is a question for anybody. Do you think the rating agencies should be able to be sued for errors in their ratings?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Because I am probably the one most associated with saying there has to be some litigation remedy, let me say I do not think it should go that far. I do not think there should be a cause of action for negligence. I do not think misjudgments should produce litigation. I think it should be for being reckless. And when you give a rating with knowing any facts at all, then it is reckless.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, then, that is a cause of----",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think you went beyond that and said should you just be sued because you made a misjudgment.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","No, no. If you find negligence, then there is a cause of action.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Well, not under the Federal securities laws, and I do not think we should try to increase anything in Federal law that would create a negligence-based cause of action against the rating agencies.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. Then, how about this question: Do you think that issuers who relied on flawed ratings to sell their product should be able to be sued for using those flawed ratings?",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think they are going to be sued directly because they made fraudulent misstatements, and that is how they are being sued. I do not think--I think the plaintiffs' bar regards the rating agencies as a possible additional party to throw in, but they have very modest expectations of what they can get from them, and they have not gotten any significant settlements.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, the question--I am over time. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","If you want to take some more time?",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, the only thing I wanted to ask is if here we have a situation where they were not given enough information or they did not investigate far enough with the mortgage-backed securities, and they accepted the fact that these were legitimate mortgage-backed securities by the banks, then I see where they would not be held responsible. But if they did not go into the details of what kind of mortgages they were selling or were being sold, then I think they should be held responsible.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","And I think that is the line between negligence and recklessness.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Bunning. Mr. Froeba, again, thank you for your testimony but also for your insights, because you actually were sort of there in the middle of this while at an opportune level, not at the top, not at the bottom, but right where the work was being done. You mentioned of your six proposals--you suggested the test, and it is interesting test: Would it avert the problems we saw? And you have suggested that the proposals before us will not accomplish that. Of those six, what is the most critical thing that from your view we would have to--or one or two that we would have to incorporate in our reforms?",Speech, 
"Mr. Froeba","In some ways, the most important would be the hardest to implement, and that is the idea that you separate the analytical function from the management function. Just as in the court system or at a university, you want your professors, you want your judges to be independent of the people who are sort of managing the process. At the rating agency, you want the analysis to be independent of the business decisions. And I think that is probably the key, also the most difficult. Another really important one is affecting the way analysts are paid. I think analysts should not be--their pay, their compensation, their reward should not have anything to do with how the company does, because the best answer from the analysts may impact company revenue negatively. You want to encourage them to give that negative answer despite the impact it may have to their own financial situation. So those two are important. I think expanding liability is key. And, finally, the one that is probably, forgive me for saying it so informally--the weirdest proposal is that the rating agencies be allowed to cooperate. If the rating agencies had gotten together 5 years ago and said we are not going to allow for the securitization of liar loans, if they had been able to get together and agree that they were all going to do that and they would not feel undercut by the competitors, I think we would have seen much of this subprime crisis averted.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Professor Coffee, I just wanted to follow up on Senator Bunning's line of questioning about liability. As you pointed out, the standard for liability under the securities laws is essentially recklessness, it is a very----",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","``Extreme recklessness.''",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","``Extreme recklessness.'' It is a very high threshold, as it should be. The proposal I have made is not to change that liability standard but to change explicitly the pleading standard. And I wanted you to--if that is your understanding since you have looked at the legislation, if that is the case. And, also, the rationale is that until you get to discovery, it is awful hard to understand what was done on a factual basis, and just your comments on that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I agree with what you are saying, and I think it is a sound proposal. I also think that it will produce very few litigated losses for the credit rating agencies because you give them in your statute a kind of safe harbor. If they get independent due diligence done by a professional, they are going to be safe. So it tells them they can avoid litigation if they do what we want them to do, which is bring in due diligence. But everything you said is correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Let me, another point, too, and I think it is important, because we specifically point out that their ratings would not be considered a forward-looking statement for purposes of Section 21(e) of the Securities Act, which is the same protection we give to accountants, et cetera. That is, I think, important because without that they are a liability for ``projecting the future forecasting'' would be, I think, inordinate. Is that another point you would----",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I agree with that, too, because we are really talking about historical information. If you knew, or should have known if you had looked, that half these mortgages were already in default, that is not forward-looking. That is really historical facts.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Secretary Barr suggested one issue, which would be suits by corporate issuers against a rating agency for a downgrade. And I guess the question--that was one reason why he suggested the Administration has not incorporated this proposal. Let me link two questions together. How likely is that, or your comments on that? But, second, you know, one of the issues, I think, in response to the exchange with Mr. Gellert was this notion of there are a lot of mortgage-backed securities out there, we should share the information with the rating agencies. I would think that the accountants who have to certify would have a responsibility at this juncture to do exactly what the rating agencies might be able to do, which is to go in there and say, ``My God, none of these loans are paying,'' and we have to mark down this item. So two comments to that, and then, Mr. Gellert, you can comment.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Well, let me say on the first point, which is the litigation question about the corporate issuer, I know a lot about this kind of litigation. Those suits were originally brought as defamation suits, and they all lost. And that is when courts started talking about the First Amendment because defamation triggers the First Amendment. None of those suits have won at all. And in the securities law area, there are other problems. The issuer did not purchase or sell. It does not have 10(b)-5 standing. And the issuer did not really rely on this because the issuer knows more about itself than anyone else, so it cannot say it was misled by the rating. That is, I think, a phantom fear that issuers will be able to sue rating agencies, but if you are concerned about it, you can expressly deal with that and make sure the statute does not apply to them.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Gellert, just a quick point about the accountants. Maybe I am imprecise in my analysis, but shouldn't they have a responsibility now if it is publicly traded, if the bank is holding this mortgage-backed security and it is underwater, don't they have to write it down?",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","Responsibilities of accountants, sir, are well beyond my expertise.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","OK. That is fair.",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","And certainly have been well covered over the past years. I certainly understand the point, and I certainly believe that the more information that is available, the more parties can be involved in opining, and that may extend and possibly should extend beyond those who are in, these intermediary roles and should extend all the way to the institutional investors who ultimately are making decisions and buying these instruments.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","That is a fair point. Thank you. Thank you all. Senator Corker, do you have a question?",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Yes, sir. I again thank all of your for your testimony. Mr. Joynt, back to you again. There has been some discussion about changing the compensation, and, by the way, I want you to know I am one of those that is slow to sort of mandate how we do those kind of things. But just going to the business model side of it, is that something that is far-fetched? Or do you think any of the credit rating agencies have thought, well, you know, we will take a bigger fee, but we will take it over time based on performance? Has any of that had any kind of serious discussion at all at your company level or, to your knowledge, Standard & Poor or others?",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","So the best discussion about that I think was at the SEC hearing, and then maybe in subsequent conversations where they are trying to think about a better or different payment model. It is very difficult for me and our firm to think about how we would adopt a separate kind of payment or fee structure without having it coordinated with others, so it would be quite problematic. You might not realize, but today, when we rate structured financings, for example, we do not take in all the income immediately. We defer a portion of the fee into the future to pay for surveillance, continuing surveillance, because if we are not rating any new issues, we still have analysts to follow the outstanding transactions. So that could be changed into some kind of success fee or some--there are alternatives, I think, that the SEC continues to progress and try to think about what could be workable.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So then in answering the question that way, you actually would not be opposed to that being mandated by the Government or the SEC, as long as everyone was doing it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Joynt","I am open to the dialogue about it. Each time we get a dialogue, there have been weaknesses in each one of the other ideas, and, of course, it could be quite a dramatic change in kind of the profile for an agency like Fitch. So, for example, in the roulette wheel alternative, if ten rating agencies decide they would like to rate a structured financing, I guess each one would only get chosen one-tenth of the time. That is quite different from today's business dynamic for our firm. So I think, you know, while we are open to the dialogue, I would have to at least consider how it would impact our business fortunes.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Professor Coffee, when Professor White--and I have enjoyed all the dialogue a great deal. But when he was talking about the particular bond manager assuming the liability of--you were shaking your head in the opposite direction his was shaking, and I just wondered if you wanted to respond to that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I mean, I don't really want to delay this hearing further. The change to an issuer-pays model was the early 1970s. Asset-backed securitizations don't really become significant before about 1990. What was happening was that the Big Two back then--Fitch wasn't really one of the Big Three at that point--really were break-even marginal companies, and as the cost became more expensive--let us forget the structure of finance--the cost could be as high as three-quarters of a million dollars to rate a very complicated structured finance offering, or at least that is the fee charged in a slightly competitive market. That is such a high cost that I don't think that can easily be dealt with under a user-pay system. You can't put all that front-end work in hoping you will get paid later on as a developing startup company. That is why they have primarily focused on corporate bonds rather than on this complex structured finance field. But all I was just agreeing with is why the system broke down. It broke down well before structured finance, and frankly, every other gatekeeper you can think of, accountants, investment bankers, lawyers, they are paid by their client, also. It has got certain efficient properties.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So it was obviously magnified and multiplied with all of these complex securities, but when you say it broke down well before, expand on that a little bit.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","Around 1972 or 1973, Moody's and Standard and Poor's started insisting that issuers pay them for the rating process. In the old days, Moody's put out a book, Moody's Bible, and in the world we get into by the 1970s, that is a very slow process of publishing a book and there is what the economists would call a public goods problem here or a free rider problem. If you sell just one copy of the book, 10,000 people can read it and they gain the same information. So you had to find some way that you could force people to subscribe to you and the marketplace didn't react well to insisting upon you pay a subscription fee.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And yet you have said that you know that is not going to change.",Speech, 
"Mr. Coffee","I think the issuer-pays model, which is the model we moved to in the 1970s, will be the predominant model as far forward as I can see. I certainly wish to encourage user-pays. I think they are a very important check and balance on the system. But I think they will primarily be a check and balance on the system and most of the business will be done under an issuer-pays business model.",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","A comment, Senator?",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Yes, sir?",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","I would just like to point out that if you look at the newer agencies, or firms, be they NRSROs or not, they are almost entirely subscription-based or user-based businesses. No one else is coming into the market and saying, let us startup a new issuer-paid. And the reason for that is that the market share is so unbelievably tightly held by three players. So for competitive reasons, for all of the regulatory reasons that we have already discussed, breaking into that business as a new player is a relatively futile effort. But I would just add to Professor Coffee's comments that one of the reasons that we start out as--a firm like us, like Rapid Ratings--starts out rating individual corporations, is, yes, they are simpler than trying to rate structured products, but the availability of information is completely different. We rate entirely based on disclosed, publicly available financial information for public companies, and private companies, it is the data that is provided to us by our customers under contract and confidentiality agreement, with full understanding on a bilateral basis that we are not conducting due diligence for them, but if they are a bank that has a lending relationship, they supply that information, if it is a corporation that has a counterparty risk relationship, they are receiving that information, they supply it to us. It is about availability of information. So new competitors, regardless of the revenue model, are not going to break into--with a couple of very small exceptions, and Real Point happens to be one of them--are going to break into the structured business when the payment, as Professor Coffee just mentioned, needs to be a front-loaded payment and the information is simply not being shared.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I appreciate your comments earlier about the unintended consequences of making everyone register. I think that was a valuable contribution. But let us move down that path just a little bit, the one you are on. We visited the offices of Second Market. I know that they are setting up a sort of a public auction process for securities and they are doing a great job and they are being very successful, and I hope they are because they have come up with a brilliant idea. At the same time, as I looked at what they were disclosing on some of these--again, as you have just mentioned, there is not as much information as one would like-- if one--and I have read op-eds recently and publications where disclosure on these securities ought to be broadly given--if that was the case, are you saying that an entity like yours actually would rate many of these more complex securities? I mean, that is a lot of work for all these securities being offered. Is that something you say you would pursue?",Speech, 
"Mr. Gellert","I am saying that we would have the choice, and that would be a business choice that we would have, and we would make it as we make any other business choice. There are other independent, non-NRSRO research firms that are staffed not in an analytical, quantitative way that we are, but staffed with enough people to be able to execute that type of analysis--not on all structured products, of course, but on individual asset class by asset class, CLOs being one of them-- and be able to provide an extremely good alternative despite the fact that not all of us would be staffed and certainly would be able to say, day one, we will go ahead and we will get into the market to do all of--to wholesale--get into the structured product rating business.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","You wanted to mention something.",Speech, 
"Mr. Froeba","Yes. I just wanted to say you can combine issuer-pay and investor-pay. They don't have to be exclusive. And you would do it by simply giving the investors the opportunity to pick which agency an issuer uses. It is the power of the issuer to decide who would rate that became the source of, I think the big problems in the last few years. They could pit the agencies against each other. And if you just take that power away from them, much of the problem is solved. Combine the two. It can't be done. I don't think it would be insurmountable.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and each of you. One of the great privileges we have here is to hear from intelligent people like you often and we thank you very much. I appreciate it.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Corker. Gentlemen, thank you for excellent testimony. My colleagues may have additional questions and I would ask them to submit them by August 12 and ask you to respond as quickly as you can. All statements of my colleagues will be made part of the record and your statements will be made fully part of the record. Thank you very much, and the hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
