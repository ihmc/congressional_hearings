"Senator Johnson","As Congress and this Committee continue its work to stabilize financial institutions and promote our Nation's economic recovery, I have called this hearing today for regulators to give us an update on the current conditions of the financial institutions in our country. It is vital that we know what continuing challenges and concerns our Nation's institutions face. Specifically, I continue to be concerned about the lending environment for small businesses, the capital needs of institutions, and the impact of commercial real estate and other loan portfolios on balance sheets. In addition, while many of the large banks in our country have stabilized, the FDIC's list of troubled banks, many of them small community banks, is growing. While restructuring our Nation's regulatory system is this Committee's top priority, I do not think we can do that without a clear understanding of what is happening within the sector. Concerns and problems within individual financial institutions will still exist even with a new regulatory structure. Continuing to ensure the safety and soundness of viable institutions and the overall financial stability of our Nation's economy is vital to protecting all Americans' pocketbooks, savings, and retirement. I want to thank the witnesses for being here today, and I look forward to hearing from each of you regarding any developing trends or concerns within the banking industry or throughout the economy, and to hear of the regulatory or supervisory steps your agencies are taking to respond to these challenges. I will now turn to Senator Crapo for his opening statement.","Speech",""
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for holding this hearing to examine the current status of the banking and credit union industry. Failures of small banks continue to grow, and the key trouble spots are looming, such as commercial real estate loans. According to a recent New York Times article, about $870 billion, or roughly half of the industry's $1.8 trillion of commercial real estate loans, now sit on the balance sheet of small and medium-sized banks. I am interested in learning to what extent the TALF, or Term Asset-backed Securities Loan Facility, encouraged capital to enter the commercial real estate market and what other steps regulators can and should take to address this problem. Many community banks and credit unions have tried to fill the lending gap created by the credit crisis. Even with these efforts, it is apparent that many consumers and small businesses are not receiving the lending they need to refinance their home loan, to extend or keep their current business line of credit, or to receive capital for new business opportunities. Regulators need to be mindful that they strike the appropriate balance to bolster capital and meet the credit needs of our economy, and FASB's new rules on off-balance sheets will create challenges on this point. As we begin to explore options to modernize our financial regulatory structure, it is important that our new structure allows financial institutions to play an essential role in the U.S. economy by providing a means for consumers and businesses to save for the future, protect and hedge against risk, and promote lending opportunities. Again, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for holding this hearing. I look forward to working with you and others on these issues.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR MIKE CRAPO"

"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, for holding this hearing on the state of the banking industry. I want to be very clear that I am concerned about the effect of this crisis on our community banks. Our national economic crisis was sparked by the preemption of State predatory lending laws, the sale of mortgages, and certainly the securitization of these mortgages by Wall Street. But it is our community banks who have been hit with repeated FDIC assessments, who have seen asset values fall, and who have seen their regulators tighten the noose. Unlike institutions that were deemed ``too big to fail,'' our community banks apparently are deemed ``small enough to fail.'' Despite the fact that community banks had little to do with causing our crisis, our community banks have been unable to lend. They are stuck with a Catch-22 situation where private sector investors are unwilling to deploy money unless the banks have TARP money in them, and TARP will not go into small banks out of concern for capitalization. Instead, the small banks are told to raise more money. I was very skeptical of TARP when first authorized because I felt it was focused too much on our Nation's largest banks. Now, given the crisis we are facing in Oregon and across the Nation, it is apparent that we need to speed credit access to the economy, and I believe that we need to support the recapitalization of our community banks as one of the best ways to get capital flowing to Main Street and get job growth started in our economy. Mr. Chair, over the next days and weeks, I will look forward to working with you and members of the Subcommittee and full Committee to figure out ways to break this gridlock and get capital flowing back to our community banks.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JEFF MERKLEY"

"Senator Brown","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I will be brief. Yesterday, I had a roundtable of 15, 16, 17 small manufacturers in my boyhood home town of Mansfield, Ohio, a community of 50,000 that has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs, as much of the Midwest and much of the country have. Over and over, the discussion turned to they cannot get credit. You know that. Small business generally cannot get credit. Manufacturers have even more trouble getting credit than other small businesses, and auto chain manufacturers, auto supply chain manufacturers have even more trouble getting credit than other manufacturers. They typically went around the table and blamed--they did not blame the banks. They mostly blamed regulators, of course. I hope that we learn in this hearing what we can do as policymakers to increase the flow of credit, especially to manufacturers. It sort of goes without saying that pulling us out of this recession--at least in historical terms, what pulls us out of recessions are housing and manufacturing, especially auto manufacturing, understanding more in my State than some others. But it is particularly important that manufacturing get the credit it needs. They have people to sell to more and more. They have people that are working 30 hours that want to work 40, and then they want to hire more people. But they cannot do any of that. They have got skilled workers, obviously, but they cannot do any of that unless credit is more liquid to them. So I ask your assistance in that. I said they blame the regulators. I do not necessarily. I think banks are fearful and cautious, for good reasons sometimes, and sometimes not so good reasons. But we are counting on you.

"Ms. Bair","Thank you. Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify on behalf of the FDIC regarding the condition of the banking industry and the measures being taken by the FDIC to address the challenges facing us in the current environment. We meet today just 1 year after the historic liquidity crisis in global financial markets that prompted an unprecedented response on the part of governments around the world. The financial landscape today is more stable than a year ago. Conditions appear to be moderating, and the liquidity of financial markets has improved. Even as we seek to end the extraordinary programs that were effective in addressing the liquidity crisis, we recognize that much more work needs to be done to meet the credit needs of households and small businesses. There is evidence that the U.S. economy is growing once again, but bank performance typically lags behind economic recovery, and this cycle is no exception. High levels of distressed assets have led to weak financial performance at many FDIC-insured institutions. These have been concentrated in three main areas: residential mortgage loans, construction loans, and credit cards. Continued high unemployment threatens to keep loss rates elevated for an extended period. As the economy improves, however, loss rates should moderate. Looking forward, the most prominent risk during the next several quarters is commercial real estate. Property cash-flows are falling due to declining rents and rising vacancies. Also, falling property prices will make it difficult for some borrowers to renew their financing. Given the substantial challenges faced by financial institutions, the FDIC maintains a balanced supervisory approach that focuses on strong oversight but remains sensitive to economic and real estate market conditions. We support banks' efforts to lend to creditworthy borrowers and to work constructively with existing borrowers to restructure loans where appropriate. I have heard reports that examiners are requiring banks to write down sound performing loans. I can assure you that that is not the policy of the FDIC. The Federal banking agencies are finalizing guidance on commercial real estate loan workouts that will make that clear. The FDIC has expressed support for making loans to creditworthy borrowers in numerous industry forums and in last November's interagency statement. In particular, banks should continue to provide credit to small businesses, an engine of growth that creates jobs. Poor credit quality and weak earnings have led to a surge in bank and thrift failures. So far this year, we have had 98 failures. While we do not expect failures at the levels experienced in the late 1980s and early 1990s, our loss rates have been significant. To address adverse market conditions, the FDIC has employed additional resolution strategies that proved successful in the 1990s: loss-sharing agreements and structured transactions. These arrangements allow the FDIC to quickly return assets to the private sector, obtain better pricing, and minimize disruption to borrowers and communities from a bank failure. They save money for the deposit insurance fund and streamline our resolution workload. As a result of increased bank failures, the deposit insurance fund is projected to need a new infusion of cash next year. To meet the fund's liquidity needs, we are seeking public comment on a proposal to collect $45 billion through a prepayment of deposit insurance assessments instead of a special assessment. In addition, we are implementing a restoration plan that should return the fund to a positive balance in 2012 and the reserve ratio to the minimum of 1.15 percent within the statutory 8-year timeframe. The FDIC will continue protecting insured depositors as we have for over 75 years. No depositor has ever lost a penny of insured deposits and never will. In closing, I would urge Congress to consider the impact of any new legislative initiatives on the structure of the banking industry as we emerge from this crisis. If reform measures perpetuate too big to fail, there will be a further trend toward consolidation into large and more complex institutions at the expense of smaller and more transparent competitors. I urge Congress to implement policies that will assure continuation of a robust community banking sector, and when institutions do fail, as some inevitably will, we need a strong resolution authority that will assure market discipline on all institutions, large and small. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION"
"Senator Johnson","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Senator Crapo, and members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to testify on the current condition of the national banking system, including trends in bank lending, asset quality, and problem banks. The OCC supervises over 1,600 national banks and Federal branches, which constitute approximately 18 percent of all federally insured banks and thrifts, holding just over 61 percent of all bank and thrift assets. As described in my written statement, the OCC has separate supervisory programs for large, mid-sized, and community banks that are tailored to the unique challenges faced by each. Today I would like to focus on three key points. First, despite early signs of the recession ending, credit quality is continuing to worsen across almost every class of asset in banks of almost every size. The strains on borrowers that first appeared in the housing sector have spread to other retail and commercial borrowers. For some credit portfolio segments, the rate of nonperforming loans is at or near historical highs. In many cases, this declining asset quality reflects risks that have been built up over time. While we are seeing some initial signs of improvement in some asset classes, as the economy begins to recover, it will take time for problem credits to work their way through the banking system because credit losses often lag behind the return to economic growth. Second, it is very important to keep in mind that the vast majority of national banks are strong and have the financial capacity to withstand declining asset quality. As I noted in testimony before the full Committee last year, we anticipated that credit quality would worsen and that banks would need to further strengthen their capital and loan loss reserves. Net capital levels in national banks have increased by more than $186 billion over the last 2 years, and net increases to loan loss reserves have exceeded $92 billion. While these increases have considerably strengthened national banks, we anticipate additional capital and reserves will be needed to absorb additional potential losses in banks' portfolios. In some cases, that may not be possible, however, and as a result, there will continue to be a number of smaller institutions that are not likely to survive their mounting credit problems. In these cases, we are working closely with the FDIC to ensure timely resolutions in a manner that is least disruptive to local communities. Third, during this stressful period, we are extremely mindful of the need to maintain a balanced approach in our supervision of national banks. We strive continually to ensure that our examiners are doing just that. We are encouraging banks to work constructively with borrowers who may be facing difficulties and to make new loans to creditworthy borrowers, although it is true that in today's weaker economic environment, credit demand among businesses and consumers has significantly declined. And we have repeatedly and strongly emphasized that examiners should not dictate loan terms or require banks to charge off loans simply due to declines in collateral values. Balanced supervision, however, does not mean turning a blind eye to credit and market conditions or simply allowing banks to forestall recognizing problems on the hope that markets or borrowers may turn around. As we have learned in our dealings with problem banks, a key factor in restoring a bank to health is ensuring that bank management realistically recognizes and addresses problems as they emerge, even as they work with struggling borrowers. One area where national banks are stepping up efforts to work with distressed borrowers is in foreclosure prevention. Our most recent quarterly report on mortgage metrics shows that actions by national bank servicers to keep Americans in their homes rose by almost 22 percent in the second quarter. Notably, the percentage of modifications that reduced monthly principal and interest payments increased to more than 78 percent of all new modifications, up from about 54 percent the previous quarter. We view this as a positive development since modifications that result in lower monthly payments are less likely to redefault. While many challenges lie ahead, especially with regard to the significant decline in credit quality, I firmly believe that the collective measures that Government officials, bank regulators, and many bankers have taken in recent months have put our financial system on a much more sound footing. The OCC is firmly committed to a balanced approach that encourages bankers to lend and to work with borrowers in a safe and sound manner while recognizing and addressing problems on a timely basis. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN C. DUGAN, COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY"
"Senator Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Dugan.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Crapo, members of the Subcommittee. Let me begin by echoing a few points that my colleagues made in either their written or oral statements. First, compared to the situation of 8 to 12 months ago, the financial system has been significantly stabilized. The largest banking institutions, each of whose financial conditions was evaluated in our stress tests and then announced to markets and the public, have raised $60 billion in capital since last spring. We continue to see a narrowing of spreads in some parts of the market, such as corporate bonds, and in short-term funding markets. Second, however, important segments of our credit system are still not functioning effectively. Many securitization markets have had trouble restarting without Government involvement. Lending by commercial banks has declined through much of 2009. This decline reflects both weaker demand and tighter supply conditions, with particularly severe consequences for small and medium-sized businesses, which are much more dependent on banks than on the public capital markets that can be accessed by larger corporations. Banks will continue to suffer significant losses in coming quarters as residential mortgage markets continue to adjust. Losses on CRE loans, which represent a disproportionate share of the assets of some small and medium-sized banks, are likely to climb. The strains on these banks, when added to the more cautious underwriting typical of recessions, compound the problems of small businesses that rely on community banks for their borrowing. Third, it is important that bank supervisors take an even- handed approach in examining banks during these stressful times. We certainly do not want examiners to exacerbate the problems of declining CRE prices and restricted availability of credit by reflexively criticizing loans solely because, for example, the underlying collateral has declined in value. At the same time, we do not want supervisory forbearance that will put off inevitable losses, which may well increase over time, with attendant implications for the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund. So it is relatively easy to summarize the situation and state the problem. The question on everyone's mind is when and how it can be ameliorated. There are no easy answers, but let me offer a few observations. We as banking regulators should certainly redouble our efforts to ensure that the even-handed guidance we are issuing in Washington will be implemented faithfully by our examiners throughout the country. But we should not fool ourselves that even the best implementation of this policy will come close to solving the problems caused by significantly reduced demand for commercial properties that were in many cases highly leveraged on the assumption of rising asset prices. The problems lie deeper. In a weak economy that has, in turn, weakened many of our banks, supervisory guidance is neither appropriate for, nor effective as, an economic stimulus measure. At the most basic level, the strengthening of CRE markets and a return to a fully healthy banking system depend on growth in the economy as a whole, and particularly on a reduction in unemployment. I believe that the most important Federal Reserve action to promote CRE recovery is through our monetary policy. Our actions to date have helped return the Nation to growth sooner than many have expected. Nonetheless, because economic performance remains relatively weak, the Federal Open Market Committee indicated after our last meeting that conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds rate for an extended period. The Federal Reserve has also taken a series of steps to increase liquidity for financing capital of interest to consumers and small businesses, including the TALF program, which we recently extended through March, with a longer extension for commercial mortgage-backed securities. I suspect, though, that more direct efforts may be needed to make credit available to some creditworthy small businesses. Congress and the Administration may wish to consider temporary targeted programs while conditions in the banking industry normalize. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"

"Ms. Matz","Thank you, Chairman Johnson, Senator Crapo, and members of the Subcommittee. I am pleased to provide NCUA's views on the state of the industry. As you have heard from my counterparts, the stress on the entire financial sector has translated into a challenging time for financial institutions, including credit unions. Nonetheless, I am confident that credit unions can and will weather the storm. Corporate credit unions pose the most serious challenges to the credit union industry. Corporate credit unions are wholesale credit unions created by retail credit unions to provide investment services, liquidity, and payment systems. For four decades, this system worked well. However, in 2008, corporate exposure to mortgage-backed securities created tangible liquidity difficulties. In response to a growing crisis, NCUA asked Congress to increase the borrowing ceiling on our back-up liquidity source--the Central Liquidity Facility. Congress granted NCUA's request, and it is clear to me that if you had not acted in such a swift and decisive manner, the entire credit union system, not just the corporate network, would have been in serious jeopardy. Despite this successful intervention, problems continued. In March, the two largest corporates were placed into conservatorship by NCUA due to the deterioration in their portfolios. Losses flowed through the system and resulted in writedowns of capital not only by other corporates but by retail credit unions that invested in these institutions. Given the tenuous real estate market, NCUA expects additional losses to materialize. These conservatorships permit the corporate system to continue to function and to serve retail credit unions and, most importantly, their 90 million members. Again, a mechanism was developed, the Corporate Credit Union Stabilization Fund, which permitted replenishment by the industry over a 7-year period. This spreading out of costs was critical as credit union earnings were already experiencing pressures. The Corporate Stabilization Fund has permitted NCUA to maintain its mandated equity ratio in the Share Insurance Fund. At no point during this crisis has the equity ratio fallen below the 1.2 percent established by Congress, and today it stands at 1.3 percent, assuring consumers that their insured deposits are safe. Retail credit unions have their own challenges independent of the corporates. The good news is that, despite the troubled economy, credit union lending has increased by almost 8 percent since 2007. However, delinquencies and loan losses have also increased, particularly in real estate lending. In 2007, about 0.3 percent of such loans were delinquent. The figure now stands at 1.62 percent. Industry-wide capital, while still strong, has declined from 11.8 percent in 2007 to 10 percent. On the one hand, I am encouraged by the fact that 98 percent of the 7,700 federally insured credit unions are at least adequately capitalized. On the other hand, 21 credit unions have failed so far this year compared to 18 in all of 2008. That number could well rise in 2010. Most troubling is the increase in credit unions which have been downgraded to CAMEL 4 and 5. Between December 2008 and August 2009, the assets of credit unions in these categories have almost doubled. Clearly, credit unions have not been spared from the harsh effects of the economic downturn. In tandem with the assessment of corporate losses described above, this presents a difficult road for credit unions to travel in 2010 and beyond. NCUA has been proactive in our efforts to mitigate the situation. NCUA examiners work with credit unions to avoid the riskiest types of mortgage lending, and this oversight was complemented by the fact that, as member-owned cooperatives, credit unions try to put their members into lending products they can afford. As a result, the industry largely steers clear of exotic mortgage lending. Only 2.3 percent of all credit union mortgage loans are exotic. Additionally, NCUA has enhanced our supervision. We shortened our examination cycle. We added 50 examiners in 2009 and anticipate adding 57 more in 2010, and we upgraded our risk management system to identify and resolve problems more quickly. NCUA has an obligation to consumers. As a safety and soundness regulator, we will be successful if we preserve strong credit unions capable of meeting the financial needs of their members. Credit union members rightfully expect a reliable and well-capitalized deposit insurance regime. While the year ahead will be challenging, I am confident that we and the credit union industry we regulate will be stronger in the end. I welcome the opportunity to answer your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DEBORAH MATZ, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION"

"Mr. Ward","Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on the financial condition and performance of the thrift industry. As of June 30, 2009, OTS regulated 794 thrift institutions with combined assets of $1.1 trillion. We also regulated 459 savings and loan holding companies with aggregated consolidated assets of approximately $5.5 trillion. Most OTS regulated thrifts are smaller, community-based institutions. At the end of the second quarter, 86 percent of the thrifts had assets less than $1 billion. Three percent, or 25 thrifts, had assets greater than $10 billion, and those 25 large thrifts held 66 percent of total industry assets. Thrifts in general are weathering the recession fairly well. Capital overall is strong. The industry's second quarter earnings improved to break even. And loan loss reserves have been substantially bolstered to near record levels. Because additions to loan loss reserves are direct charges to income, the industry's earnings remain weak by historical standards. Loss provisioning is expected to continue at elevated levels until inventories of unsold homes decline, home prices stabilize, and the employment picture brightens. Problem assets are continuing to increase, rising to 3.52 percent of total assets in the second quarter, up from 2.68 percent 1 year earlier. This compares unfavorably to an average level of 0.78 percent from 2000 to 2007. These stresses have caused an increase in problem thrifts and a general decline in safety and soundness ratings across the industry. As of September 30, 2009, there were 42 problem thrifts representing 5.4 percent of all OTS-regulated thrifts. A year ago, there were 16 problem thrifts, or 2 percent of the total. Twelve thrifts have failed this year, compared with five last year. The OTS is working closely with problem institutions to prevent failures, but more thrifts are expected to fail before the economy fully recovers. Foreclosures continue to be a concern. Although sustainable loan modifications and payment plans to avoid foreclosures are increasing, the number of seriously delinquent mortgages and foreclosures in process are continuing to rise. Progress is being made on this front, but when so many American families are losing their homes, the progress certainly does not seem to be fast enough. In summary, Mr. Chairman, it is too early for us to say we have hit bottom and the worst is over. We believe significant challenges lie ahead as unemployment continues to rise and the housing market continues to work its way through a significant down cycle. Despite these challenges, the overall condition of the thrift industry is sound, with strong capital and substantially bolstered loss reserves. Recent earnings have shown signs of improvement, reflecting what we hope are indications that the nation's economy is beginning to turn around. Thank you again for having me here today. I look forward to responding to your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY T. WARD, DEPUTY DIRECTOR, EXAMINATIONS, SUPERVISION, AND CONSUMER PROTECTION, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION"

"Mr. Smith","Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo, members of the Subcommittee, I am Joseph A. Smith, Jr. I am North Carolina Commissioner of Banks and Chairman of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors, on whose behalf I am testifying. Thank you very much, as always, for the opportunity. The members of CSBS and our Federal partners, the FDIC and the Federal Reserve, supervise 73 percent of the banks in the United States, accounting for approximately 30 percent of total banking assets. Our banks are not, as a rule, systemically significant. However, they are locally significant in the markets they serve, which includes virtually all of the United States. State chartered banks provide healthy competition in urban markets and are often the only banks in rural and exurban markets. While there are pockets of strength in some parts of the country, the majority of my colleagues have characterized banking conditions in their States as, and I quote, ``gradually declining.'' This should be no surprise, given that traditional banks are a reflection of the overall health of the economy. What cannot be ignored is that the return to health of our largest banks is the direct result of unprecedented, extraordinary efforts by Congress and Federal regulators to ensure their success. The majority of banks, however, have not been the beneficiaries of this assistance and are experiencing a harshly, harshly procyclical regulatory environment, as required by Federal law. This explains the tale of two industries you are likely hearing from banks in your State versus the news you hear from Wall Street. What can or should be done about this? My colleagues and I submit that the place to start is with a vision of what we, the industry, policymakers, regulators, and other stakeholders, want the U.S. banking market to look like after the current troubles have subsided. In our view, the desirable outcome is a banking industry that continues to be competitive, with thousands of banks, rather than hundreds or tens, diverse, of banks of various sizes, operating strategies, and customer focuses, and strong, with capital, liquidity, and risk management sufficient to meet the challenges of the marketplace. This is not an argument for the status quo. In fact, my colleagues and I are in general agreement with our Federal colleagues that our banks have been too concentrated in commercial real estate and too dependent on non-core deposits. Where we sometimes disagree with them is on the severity with which we judge banks in a down market, the result of which is, in our view, to make bad situations worse. I would hasten to add that our disagreements are of degree, not kind. We generally agree with the diagnosis. The treatment is sometimes debatable. To address the current stress of our banks, CSBS respectfully suggests, one, that on-the-ground supervisors be given greater latitude to assess the condition of banks based on reasonable economic assumptions rather than assumptions of the end of the world. Two, that clear rules of the road be established for private equity investments and that supervisory applications by strategic investors be expedited once clearly established thresholds have been met. Three, that the acquisition of distressed banks by healthy banks be expedited and at least considered for capital purchase investments under the TARP program. Fourth, that troubled banks be allowed to reduce their dependence on brokered deposits in a gradual and orderly way. And fifth, that Congress seriously consider revisions to the Prompt Corrective Action and Least Cost Resolution provisions of FDICIA, which have limited regulatory discretion in the handling of distressed institutions. While we don't think that our suggestions will solve all the problems of the banking industry, we do think they can reduce the number of failures and the attendant cost to the Deposit Insurance Fund, which is, let it be remembered, funded by healthy banks. We believe our approach can reduce at least the pace of decline in the commercial real estate market with potential positive effects on the economy and the recovery. Importantly, it can help preserve the diversity of our financial system that is critical to the future health and even viability of our State and local economies. Once again, thank you for this opportunity to appear before you. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you, sir.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOSEPH A.

"Mr. Candon","Honorable Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and members of the Subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify. I am the Deputy Commissioner of Banking and Securities for the Vermont Department of Banking, Insurance, Securities, and Health Care Administration. I appear on behalf of the State Credit Union Regulators as Chairman of NASCUS. Today, I will share information on the conditions of State credit unions and areas for reform. Like all financial institutions, State credit unions have been adversely affected by the current economy. However, at this point, State natural person credit unions remain generally healthy and continue to serve the needs of their members and their communities. For the most part, natural person credit unions did not engage in many of the practices that precipitated the current market downturn. However, we have several issues to bring to your attention about the impact of the economy and the need for capital options for credit unions. State regulators remain concerned about unemployment and its effects on credit union members' ability to meet their obligations. We also see increases in delinquencies and charge- offs as well as pressure on earnings, especially in smaller State credit unions. Although loan delinquency and net charge- offs have increased, State regulators indicate that the levels remain manageable. In response to this trend, regulators are increasing their oversight of consumer credit products, including auto loans, credit cards, real estate and home equity loans. State regulators are also closely monitoring member business lending in credit unions. Some States, including my home State of Vermont, have not experienced the fallout from commercial real estate or subprime lending because State credit unions do not engage in those activities. State regulators continue to encourage credit unions to exercise sound underwriting practices, proper risk management, and due diligence, as these are the practices that have kept credit unions healthier through the economic downturn. In anticipation of prolonged economic problems, State regulators will closely monitor both lending and investment activities. State regulators also emphasize strong governance standards at the credit union board level. We will continue close supervision through offsite monitoring and onsite examinations and visitations. The growing trend toward consolidation is on the minds of State regulators as credit union mergers continue to occur, both voluntarily and for regulatory purposes. As economic pressures continue, finding suitable merger partners may become more difficult. In response to your question about capital needs, access to capital for credit unions is critical. Unlike other financial institutions, credit union access to capital is limited to reserves and retained earnings. State regulators recommend capital raising options for all credit unions. Access to supplemental capital will enable credit unions to respond proactively to changing market conditions, thereby strengthening safety and soundness and providing a buffer for the Credit Union's Share Insurance Fund. It is NASCUS's studied belief that a change to the Federal law could provide this valuable tool to credit unions without altering their nonprofit and cooperative structure. Supplemental capital will not be appropriate for every credit union nor would every credit union need access to supplemental capital. However, the option should be available. State regulators are also concerned about the impact of corporate credit union losses on natural person credit unions. Given the severity of the losses, it is clear that enhanced regulatory standards for capital, governance, and risk management are necessary. State regulators are working with the NCUA to ensure the safety and soundness of corporate credit unions and to mitigate future risk. Last, I would like to emphasize the value of the dual regulatory system. State regulators have demonstrated the importance of local supervision of State-chartered institutions and the value of the dual regulatory system. State regulators have always emphasized consumer protection along with safety and soundness as an important part of their mission and accountability to Governors and State legislatures. Further, State regulators have the expertise to identify areas of risk and take enforcement actions where necessary. As regulatory modernization efforts are considered by the Senate Banking Committee, we encourage you to retain State supervision and reaffirm State authority. NASCUS and State regulators appreciate the opportunity to testify today. I will be pleased to respond to any questions that you have. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF THOMAS J.

"Senator Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Candon. Let us put 7 minutes on the clock for each member to ask questions of our witnesses. Ms. Bair, so far, 98 institutions have failed this year and the FDIC's watch list has grown to 416 institutions. How many more of the troubled institutions do you anticipate will fail? Is the FDIC staffed up to deal with an increase in failures?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Mr. Chairman, thank you for asking that question. There will be more failures. We do not make our failure projections public, but failures will continue at a pretty good pace this year and next. We think we will have about $100 billion in losses over a 5-year period starting at the beginning of 2009. Twenty-five billion of that has already been realized from failures this year, and we have already reserved for another $32 billion as of the end of the second quarter. We are ready for this, though. We have been prepared for some time. We started staffing up in 2007, especially in our receivership and resolution staff, but also beefing up our examination staff. We have 6,300 staff on board now. That number will likely go to 7,000. We also have a significant roster of consultants that we use to help with bank closings as well as asset valuations, asset management, and asset marketing. The FDIC really is designed for this type of activity. We can expand very quickly and then contract very quickly. A lot of our hires are temporary 2-year hires. Overall, we have got a very good track record. These closings have been seamless. Through using loss share, we have been able to, more often than not, do a whole bank transaction. So another bank that serves that same community acquires both the deposits and the assets, which is good for bank customers. Frequently, the depositors are also the borrowers at the bank. Overall, it has been handled well. I think the staff have made a tremendous effort. We are well staffed and very much prepared for this.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Governor Tarullo, there has been much concern raised that commercial real estate is the next problem area for financial institutions. What are the differences between the concerns over commercial real estate and the problems we experienced last year with mortgages?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, other than the fact that each presents a significant and troubled portfolio of assets for financial institutions, I think there are some salient differences. First, and I think of particular interest to many Members of this Committee, the places in which the mortgages are relatively concentrated do vary. As I noted in my opening statement, although large financial institutions certainly do have CRA exposures on their books, proportionately speaking the exposures are to a much more significant extent on the books of smaller and regional institutions, and oftentimes--not always, but oftentimes, those exposures are geographically concentrated. You have a small bank that tends to lend in a fairly small area. If the commercial real estate market there goes bad, then there is a problem. So, that is number one. Number two, in commercial real estate, generally speaking you don't have a 30-year fixed mortgage, as you do with residential mortgages. Instead, you have loans that need to be rolled over as a project proceeds or as a completed project is paid down, and that means you have a refinancing problem. So this year and next, we have got about $500 billion each year that is going to need to be refinanced and that creates a set of challenges that are perhaps no more serious than, but different from, the case with residential mortgages. Third, I would say that while there is some similarity, there are some different ways in which the situation plays out. We had subprime mortgages. We had Alt-A mortgages, we had prime mortgages, which as you know, Senator, presented ultimately the same set of problems, but at different times. In the commercial real estate arena, we have got very different kinds of lending, and there is an important distinction between construction and development loans, where essentially the builder is just starting to put something on the property, on the one hand, and so-called income-producing properties, a completed hotel or a multi-unit residential structure, where there is an income stream. The most serious problems are going to be in the former category, with the construction and development loans, which have no income stream. You are going to have problems in the second category, but that is something you can at least try to work with in some cases.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Ms. Matz, I know that the NCUA is currently in the process of finalizing new rules for its corporate credit unions. Are you considering changes regarding the concentration of risks that corporate credit unions can have?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Matz","Thank you for asking that question. As I think you are aware, when I was on the NCUA Board in 2002, I was the lone member who voted against the corporate rule at that time because I felt it didn't provide adequate parameters on investment authority and concentration of risk. So, we won't make that mistake again. At our Board meeting in November, we will take up the proposed corporate rule and we will address the riskiest area, which we consider the investment authority. We will set limits on the types of securities and the concentration of securities that corporates can invest in. We will address capital. We will have stringent requirements for capital retention that will be comparable to Basel I. We will set requirements for asset liability management so that asset cash-flow and liability cash-flows match. And we will have new governance rules, which are not included in the current regulation. So, I believe we will address the issues that led to the problems we are having today.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Ms. Bair, do you have any concerns about smaller institutions having risk concentrated in one product area or one geographic area?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Getting back to some of the regulatory reform issues that this Committee will be looking at, I think the community banking sector is very important to our economy and very important to our country. I do worry that because of competitive pressures and uneven playing fields, that they have become highly concentrated in commercial real estate loans and small business lending. Those are their niche areas where they have been able to hold ground against the larger banks as well as the shadow sector. I would like to see them be able to diversify their balance sheet, especially in consumer retail, and get back into providing those financial services. So, I do think that this is important. But in the near term, clearly, there is a lot of commercial real estate on the books of smaller banks. For the most part, they have managed those exposures well. Some, though, are more distressed than others, and clearly, commercial real estate will be a bigger driver of bank failures going forward.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Crapo.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. There are a lot of issues that I would like to explore with this panel, but in my first round, at least here, I want to focus on one, and that is, as I think everybody knows, amidst all the issues that we are dealing with here in Congress, one of them, one of the big ones that I expect we will be dealing with more aggressively soon is the overall financial regulatory restructuring that is being proposed. I would like to get the opinion of the members of the panel with regard to their thoughts on one aspect of that, and that is the proposal that we consolidate all of the banking regulators into one single Federal banking regulatory agency. I don't know that in my 7 minutes I can get through the whole panel, but let us start with you, Ms. Bair.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Thank you, Senator. My position is out there already. We have not liked this idea. The proposal was pushed in 2006 as an FSA-type model, although I know some of the ideas kicked around were a little different from FSA. We fear regulatory consolidation regardless of where it might be located. Clearly there may be some room for streamlining of bank regulation, but concentrating all the power with a single entity is a tremendous bet. If they do the right thing, then maybe we are OK. But if they do the wrong thing, we are really in the soup. In particular, taking the FDIC out of the supervisory process and the process of setting the capital standards and the underwriting standards, et cetera, would go in a different direction from where this Committee would like to go. We are not perfect by any means, but we are a conservative voice. Since we have a tremendous exposure as deposit insurer, our record shows that we are conservative when it comes to supervisory measures. Being an examiner also gives us a constant stream of information about banking trends, which helps us a lot in setting insurance premiums as well as helping our examiners prepare for working with the State regulators or the Federal chartering regulators when banks get into trouble and have to be wound down and put into resolution. So, we are very concerned about it. We fear it would weaken the FDIC. It could overall weaken banking regulation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. Mr. Dugan, do you have an opinion on this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I do. As we testified here on this very subject about a month ago, I can't sit here and defend four separate Federal banking regulators and a separate holding company regulator. We don't have four food and drug agencies and the like. But I do think, on the other hand, if you moved all the way to one single regulator, you get some benefits in efficiency, but you also get some tradeoffs of the kind that Chairman Bair just described, that if you take certain regulators out of their current supervision, they don't keep their hand in it to the extent that they otherwise would. And so if you asked me, do I think that we can have more consolidation in the industry, I would say yes. But I would say to be careful. Each step along way, the trade-offs become more pronounced.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. Mr. Tarullo, I want to hold off on you yet, because I want to get the perspective of the State Bank Supervisors from Mr. Smith before my time runs out, and then we will come back if we can.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Smith","We oppose it from the tops of our heads to the bottoms of our feet----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Smith","----for the reasons that Chairman Bair has stated, and we believe honestly and truly that a single regulator would weaken or destroy the dual banking system and think that would be a bad thing for America.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","All right. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Senator. So, let me echo the approach that Comptroller Dugan took, which is to say in any proposal, you are going to have some benefits and you are going to have some costs. I think on this one, I would just add two points, or reiterate one point and make an additional point. The reiteration is the point that Chairman Bair made, which is you lose something, and part of what you lose here is the insight that the Federal Deposit insurer or the monetary policy authority gets into the functioning of the banking system by being an examiner, and that is something that does require experience. It does require actually being involved in the guts of examination and supervision. Second, in terms of priorities, again, it is certainly debatable what model you want to have, and a lot of countries around the world have debated it, but I don't think that the existence of multiple banking regulators at the Federal level played a particularly important role in the genesis of this crisis. There are a lot of problems. There was a lot of blame to go around for a lot of reasons. But I don't think it was the coexistence of the FDIC and the Comptroller that was a particular problem here.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Matz","","Speech"," "
"Ms. Matz","The Administration proposal kept NCUA as an independent regulator, and we support that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","So you are willing to stick with that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Matz","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","All right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ward","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ward","We think multiple viewpoints among the regulators fosters better decisionmaking and is a very healthy thing. We have a tremendous working relationship with the FDIC. We don't always see eye-to-eye on our institutions, but that is a very healthy pressure among our examiners.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","All right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Candon","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Candon","Thank you, Senator. I would second what Chairman Matz responded to your question. The President had recommended the NCUA be left out of the consolidation. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","All right. Thank you. Let me go back to you, Mr. Smith. As you indicated, you are very opposed to the consolidation. Mr. Dugan indicated that although one single regulator wouldn't necessarily be the way you--if I am correctly representing you--would go, that we don't really need four or five. What are your thoughts about that? Is there room for some consolidation?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Smith","Well, far be it from we poor State regulators to tell the Federal folks what to do with your territory. I think there could be consolidation, I guess, among the Federal agencies, but I will say we believe, and I agree with Governor Tarullo and Chairman Bair, that our relationships that we have with the Fed and the FDIC work very well, and we also agree with the Obama administration's proposal to leave that alone and unimpaired.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","All right. Thank you. I am going to shift gears and come back to you, Ms. Bair, and this really is a question on the resolution authority and the process of resolution when a bank is seized or declared a failed bank. I recently have had a couple of those experiences in Idaho and I have had those who have been borrowers from the bank contact me to indicate that they really are not happy with the resolution authority. Just to give you an example, there are some who have contacted me who have indicated that they were in a position to repay much more than their particular loan ended up being auctioned for by the FDIC and that in that process, what happened was they were put in a bad situation because the loan was auctioned. The person or entity that purchased the loan immediately called it due. They were then put in a bind. The FDIC got 30 or 40 cents on the dollar. The one who really gained was the person who bought it at auction. The taxpayer didn't win. The FDIC didn't win. The borrower didn't win. And the bank didn't win. What is your reaction to that kind of an inquiry?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I do hear this a lot and I look into it when I hear it. I don't know what the specific situation is you referred to, but I have found that, frequently, what has happened is a borrower may be wanting to get a bit of a deal. We are subject to least cost resolution, and although some reasonable price could perhaps be considered that would be better than what we would get if we auctioned the pool of loans off, other times, we have been approached by borrowers who just want a really low price for themselves--50 or 60 cents on the dollar or lower. That is not something that we can justify under least cost. Also, sometimes they will say they want to buy their loan out, but they don't have the cash resources to do it. So, when we ask for verification of their financial resources or who their new lender will be, they are not able to provide that. Sometimes the truth here is a bit more difficult than it may appear initially. Our policy is to offer borrowers the ability to buy back their loan if they offer a reasonable price and have the financial capability to do that. At my request, our ombudsman put together a Borrower Bill of Rights, which is on our website, and I would be happy to share with you and your staff, so that borrowers understand our process and what they can do. If the prices go too low, there is a question about least cost to our Fund, also. It is very difficult, given the volume that we have to do, to individually sell each of these loans, and at some point, you just have to market them in bulk. But, if a borrower is offering a reasonable price, has the financial capability and can show they can buy the loan back, we will sit down and accommodate them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Merkley.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Chairman Bair, I wanted to go back to your testimony. You mentioned that you do not share your forecasts on the number of banks that might fail, and I can certainly understand that. Are you able to give us an order of magnitude? For example, in 2008 we had 25 banks failing; in 2009, it is up to just shy of 100. Do we expect the next year to look more like 2008 or more like","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","It will look more like 2009.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","More like 2009. Thank you. Chairman, community banks hold 11 percent of the industry assets, but 38 percent of small business and small farm loans. Since small business is a key driver of the economic recovery, would it be fair to say that recapitalizing community banks would be a smart way to get lending flowing back to Main Street?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","We have been in discussions with Treasury for some time about making the TARP program work better for community banks. The 25 largest domestic institutions that qualified 100 percent participation in the TARP program. For the smaller institutions, it is about 9 percent. So, clearly, we think the program could be working better for the smaller institutions. In preparation for this testimony, I went back to look at small loan balances of larger and smaller institutions. Even though year over year, as of June 30th, small loan balances were down 1.9 percent overall, for the community banks, those less than $1 billion in assets, loan balances were up slightly over 2 percent. So community banks look like they are still in there trying to make these loans, but some additional capital support would be really helpful.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Could you give us some sense of what that might look like?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","While this is Treasury's program, an idea that has been discussed is a dollar-for-dollar matching program. Right now the viability standard puts a lot of pressure on our examiners to try to identify the institutions that are, without the additional money, viable. Frankly, the ones that are clearly viable without the money do not want it. It is really the institutions where the decision is less clear that will come to us. But many times they are worthy, we think, and can raise significant private capital. So we have suggested a dollar-for-dollar matching program. This would provide an additional validation of viability from the market. The market may be willing to put additional capital in, help provide some additional protection to Treasury, and perhaps make the terms a little less onerous. This could perhaps be tied to increasing small business loans. So I think there are--and I know Senator Warner has had some thoughts on this--ways to approach this that would make the program work better for the smaller banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you. And would this have--did I see a hand raised there? Oh, no. Just scratching. OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","At hearings and auctions, you have to be very careful how you are moving. In terms of the impact upon our commercial real estate, what are things that we can do to assist our community banks and, therefore, our small commercial real estate markets as we face a lot of balloon loans that will be coming due in the couple years ahead?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think it is a problem. We are encouraging banks to work to restructure these loans. If they have a creditworthy borrower, a restructured loan with a lower payment, can make that a performing loan. We want them to do that. That preserves value, just the way it does with home mortgages. It is the same principle with commercial real estate. And we are in the process of finalizing guidance right now that makes that very clear and provides examples to our examiners of what we consider prudent workouts. This should be encouraged, not criticized. In the near term that is the best we can do. Of course, bringing back the securitization market for commercial mortgages is going to be much more difficult. I know the Federal Reserve Board has been working on that, as has Treasury. But that is going to be a longer haul.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","One of the things I keep hearing back home in Oregon is from owners who have fully performed on their loans, but as their loans come up to be rolled over, the estimate of the value of their property has dropped enough that the bank is very nervous about reissuing it. Is there any form of guarantee that the Federal Government could do for, if you will, the difference in the drop in equity on loans that have been performing for the entire period to enable those banks to be able to meet the regulators' requirements and at the same time be able to reissue those loans so we do not freeze up or seize up in those commercial markets?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I am unaware of any current programs that would do that. That is a new idea. I would just like to think about it. Others might want to have a comment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","All right. Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Bunning.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. This is for the primary regulators, though others may want to answer this question also. Do you have enough power to restrict the activities and risk taking of banks and holding companies? Do not be bashful.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Usually you are not.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, for holding companies, no. I would defer to the holding company regulators down the aisle here. We have no authority over holding companies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, you do have a lot of banks, though.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That we do.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","For the banks themselves, I think we do have adequate powers to restrict activities that we think are unsafe and unsound, but not the holding companies. Just the bank and the direct subsidiaries of the banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Fed?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, with respect to banks, I think on an ongoing basis, the answer is yes, although when it comes to closing an institution, we do not have the breadth of authority that the OCC or the FDIC has for the banks for which they are the primary Federal regulators. With respect to holding companies, there is, as you know, some lingering ambiguity from the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act as to the reach of Federal Reserve authority over regulated subsidiaries.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","On in the Fed's mind.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, I think it is in a number of people's minds, and as we have said before, we would welcome clarification of that in any legislation that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","We clarified that in 1994, but that has not been interpreted by the Fed.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","If you look at the statute and the legislative history, there was some sense that there was supposed to be deference to functional regulators of subsidiaries.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Correct. And you were powered to write the regs and did not.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, as you know, I cannot----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I am not going to get into that dispute with you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","OK. So let me just leave it there, though, with--I think with respect to the bank----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Ms. Bair, would you like to comment about your ability to regulate the banks with the power that you now have?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","There may be certain detailed areas, for instance, back-up authority, where through our good working relationships, we are able to effectively use it. Although, if we ever needed to bring an enforcement action with back-up authority, it is a fairly protracted process. Going forward as part of reform, we would like to see greater consistency in standards, particularly capital standards, between bank holding companies and banks. We think bank holding companies should be a source of strength for banks and should at least have as strong a capital level and quality of capital as the banks. There are a few areas where we would like to see some improvements, and that is not a secret. My fellow regulators know of our views on that. But, overall, I think the powers for both banks and bank holding companies have been pretty adequate, and perhaps there are areas where we could have used them better. Again, in terms of reform, looking at the disparities between the bank and the non-bank sector cannot be emphasized enough. As we try to improve the robust nature and quality of bank and bank holding company regulation, if there is still a giant shadow sector out there that is basically beyond the reach of meaningful prudential oversight, you are going to have the same problem that drove this crisis. Higher-risk activity will go into that shadow sector.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That is basically what I am asking. In other words, if there is a bank either that you are in charge of or the OCC or the holding companies, and they are doing things that you know that get them in trouble, can you stop it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You have enough power to stop it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","The Fed also.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Ultimately, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Ultimately. OK. Why should firms that are supported by taxpayers' guarantees and insured deposits and access to Fed windows be allowed to make huge profits on their own trading? What restrictions have you put on these activities?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, the restrictions that would apply to the activities of subsidiaries of financial holding companies or bank holding companies would be the capital liquidity and risk management restraints that would apply to any holding company, which is to say there is substantially less leverage permitted for such a company today than may have been the case before it became a bank holding company. And so that puts non-trivial constraints on what they can do. But under the structure of Gramm-Leach-Bliley, they are permitted to have subsidiaries that do engage in these trading activities so long as they conform to the capital and liquidity requirements.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","If I have heard it once, I have heard it ten times, from not only the Secretary of the Treasury but the head of the Federal Reserve, that there are institutions in this country that are too big to fail. Too big to fail. Now, it is up to the people sitting at this desk or these all gathered here to stop that. I need suggestions.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think Chairman Bair alluded earlier to something with which I certainly agree, that we need to have capital and other requirements that take full account of the additional risk that may be created by very large institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","The AIGs of the world.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","The AIGs of the world for certain, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","OK.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, and as we have said before, we do think----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I wanted to ask you one more question before you get away since I only have 25 seconds. Right now the FDIC is considering forcing banks to prepay their assessments for the next 3 years. I have two questions about this. First, earlier this year you asked Congress for a higher credit line at Treasury, and we gave it to you. Why didn't you use that credit line? Is it really because Treasury has no room under the debt ceiling?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No, that is not the reason. We view the credit line as being there for emergencies for unexpected loss. Particularly, earlier this year, we thought it was very urgent to make sure we had plenty of breathing room there. But what we are talking about with the prepaid assessments for losses is different.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","There is only one problem with that. The banks that have not put you in the problem are the very banks that are going to get assessed.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, the prepaid assessment is different from the special assessment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I understand that, but they are the same banks.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","They are the same banks, and at the end of the day, that is how insurance works. The lower risk banks end up generally to some level subsidizing the higher risk banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Let me finish this. Second, will that prepaid payment be enough to cover all the losses? Or will you have to raise more money again in the future?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Based on our current projections, that will be more than ample. But, again, a lot of this depends on the economy. So if the economy has unforeseen troubles, that could be different. But based on current projections this year, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I am only an economist, so I would tell you you've got a problem.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Tester.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to step back a little bit, Chairwoman Bair, to what Senator Crapo was--just very quickly. You said that when it came to buying back loans per se, the borrowers were often given a chance to buy those loans back. How is the value of those determined?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","It is difficult. Certainly if they just want to buy their loan back at what they owe----","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","At 100 percent----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right. Then that would be great. We would welcome that. Again, they need to demonstrate they actually have the ability to do that. If they want to have a discount, a couple of issues arise. If they have the capability to keep paying on the loans, if the loan is performing, the question becomes whether we should negotiate a deal for a borrower that is otherwise fully capable of making repayment on the loan. Even then, we do provide some flexibility, but we are required to pursue least-cost resolution, which means we need to get the best price for all the loans that we inherit in a receivership. Frequently just trying to do them one by one is not administratively practical and would get generally lower prices than if you market them all in bulk.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Right. So seldom do you peel one loan out and sell it.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I can get you numbers of how often it happens. But, again, if they want to pay it off completely, we welcome that. Even below that, we will work with them. But frequently they are not able to. They say they want to, but they are not able to.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. The deposit insurance fund, we have about what you are going to do in the short term. The Senator from Kentucky talked a little bit about the long term. Do you plan on permanently raising the rates on the long term, over the long term, to handle solvency in that fund?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right. Well, we would bump up the rates by three basis points beginning in 2011. That would bring the base rate up to 15 to 19 basis points for most banks. That is still well below the 23 basis points that was assessed on the industry during the S&L days. So as the economy recovers, as the banking sector heals, as our losses go down, we will constantly reassess that. We will stay within the range that Congress has prescribed, though I think perhaps Congress may want to think about giving us additional flexibility to build the fund up in good times. It is something that will be continuously monitored, but as of our projections now, we believe with the three-basis-point bump-up in 2011, we will be able to reestablish the fund and get it back to 1.15 within 8 years, which is what Congress has asked us to do.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Is there a point in time in which you permanently raise their rates?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No, I do not think so. When the FDIC Board sets risk-based assessments, consideration is given to the risks in the banking system and the needs of the DIF to cover projected losses.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","This can be for Mr. Tarullo or Mr. Dugan. Actually, you can answer it, too, Ms. Bair. But there has been a lot of discussion about the make-up of systemic risk regulators and the powers entrusted to that body. I guess the question is--and, Mr. Smith, you may want to jump in on this, too. Do you believe there is a value in allowing representatives from State regulators to participate in the systemic risk regulator?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think it depends, as it often does, on how one conceives of what a systemic risk regulator is doing. I think there have been discrete functions which sometimes get lumped under that umbrella. What we have thought of in terms of the Federal Reserve's role is consolidated supervision of systemically important institutions, and so it is very much a supervisory function, making sure that you are covering everybody who could pose a risk to the system. And in that context, of course, if there is a State bank, the State banking supervisor absolutely should be participating. A second context is thinking in terms of collective efforts to identify emerging risks and figure out what can be done, and there I think it is profitable to have people who see things from different parts of the financial system participating.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. If there is a council of regulators, should the State regulators be represented?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","It depends, I think, Senator, on the functions of that council. If it is a matter of analysis and scrutiny and trying to coordinate, then I think there is a good case to be made for it. If it is a matter of actually making some binding Federal law decisions, then it probably is not.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Sheila, I have heard from banks that the FDIC is becoming more and more concerned about AG loans. Is that true? And I guess the question is why, even though the markets are in the tank. That probably answers it.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Not that I am aware of, Senator. We have been monitoring it for some time, but this is the second time in a week that somebody has asked for that so maybe I will probe a little more.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","But not that I am aware of, no. We are monitoring this.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","I appreciate that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Senator, could I just go back to the borrower question?","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Go ahead. Sure.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","One of the reasons we do whole bank transactions with loss share is if we can sell the whole bank, we do not run into this problem. A new bank gets those loans, services those loans, and it preserves the relationship with the borrower. It is only where we cannot do the whole bank transaction that we get into this problem.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Well, I understand. You are kind of between a rock and a hard place, quite honestly, because it does not seem quite fair to let somebody else make a bunch of dough on it when you could cut that--anyway, I do not want to go there. Mr. Tarullo, there was a front-page story in the Wall Street Journal--we are going down a little different avenue here now--that talked about workers at the top 23 investment banks, hedge funds, asset managers, stock and commodity exchanges can expect to earn even more this year than they did in 2007, which was the peak year. I guess the question is, getting right to it: Are we returning to the attitude of greed that really occurred before the economic downturn--and that is being kind--in 2008?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I do not know, Senator, that I can comment on what everybody else out there is thinking. I guess here is what I would say: First, I do have concerns sometimes in a variety of contexts that people in general, including in financial institutions, have not come to grips with the fact that things have changed. Things have changed in a basic way, and I think the presence of many of us at this table today promises that things are going to change more. That means business models. That means the way of assessing risk. That means how you run your institution. Second, with respect to the story itself, I do think that is a bit speculative, it is a bit projecting what is about to happen, and I think we should watch and see what, in fact, does happen and what, in fact, these firms are doing with their capital standards, which is ultimately of great importance to us.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. If I might, Mr. Chairman, you know what the unemployment numbers.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I do.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","And there are folks in many of these companies that are up here right now lobbying to make sure t there is no or very, very little regulation on a lot of the incidences that created the economic collapse. Do you find that some--because they are making a ton of dough. Do you find that somewhat ironic, troublesome?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","What I hope is that this Committee and the Congress as a whole will pass a strong set of reforms, no matter what other people out there are saying.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Gregg.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank the panel for their excellent testimony. It has been most interesting. First off, I want to congratulate the FDIC for deciding to forward-fund the fees. I think that is the right approach. You do a lot of things right. You have done a lot of things right during this problem. You did a lot of things right when I was Governor in 1989 in New Hampshire and five of our seven largest banks closed. Mr. Seidman came in and basically was our white knight. But you did say something that really concerns me, and that is, how you interpret the TARP, this idea that the TARP should be now used as a capital source for a lot of smaller banks that are having problems raising capital. I think all of you basically in your testimony have said we are past the massive systemic risk of a financial meltdown that would have caused a cataclysmic event. TARP came about because of that massive potential cataclysmic event, and its purpose was to basically stabilize the financial markets and be used in that manner in order to accomplish that. As one of the authors, along with Senator Dodd--we sat through the negotiations of that--I think I am fairly familiar with that purpose. That was the goal. It should not now be used as a piggy bank for housing. It should not be used as a piggy bank for whatever the interest of the day is that can be somehow--it should not have been used for the automobile industry, and it really should not be used in order to have a continuum of capital available to smaller banks who have problems, in my opinion, because then you are just going to set up a new national program which will essentially undermine the forces of the market, and that would be a mistake. I did hear you say, Madam Chairman, that you expect $100 billion in losses. Is that a net number? Or do you expect to recoup some percentage of that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No, that is what we project our losses to be over the next 5 years.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","So that is a net number after recoupment?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Well, is it--do you expect of that $100 billion in bad loans to be getting back 30 percent of----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","The $100 billion would be our losses. So let us say we had a 25-percent loss rate on our bank failures so far, so you would be talking about $400 billion in failed bank assets.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Well, OK, so it----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That is since the beginning of 2009, though. And, again, a lot of that has already been realized and reserved for.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","And you have got $64 billion, you said, or something, that has been realized and reserved against, so you have got about----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That is right, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","----$36 billion to go. OK. I have got a philosophical question here. If we look at this problem--granted, commercial real estate is now the problem, but commercial real estate, as I understand it from your testimony, is not--it is a serious problem. It is just not a systemic event. It is not going to cause a meltdown of our industries--of our financial industry. It may impact rather significantly especially the middle-sized regional banks and some of the smaller banks, but it is not systemic. The systemic event was caused in large part in the banking industry by the primary residence lending activity--subprime, Alt-A, and regular loans. And all I heard about as the proposals for getting at this is regulatory upon regulatory layers to try to figure out a way to basically protect ourselves from having that type of excess in this arena occur again. But when you get down to it, it is all about underwriting. I mean, the bottom line is this is about underwriting. It is about somebody lent to somebody who either did not have the wherewithal to pay it back or who had an asset which was not worth what they lent on that asset. And probably the person who lent it did not really care because they were just getting the fee and they were going to sell it into the securitized market anyway. So if you really want to get at this issue, wouldn't it be more logical and simpler and--it is not the whole solution. Clearly, there has to be regulatory reform. But shouldn't we look at the issue of having different underwriting standards, both of which the OCC and the FDIC have the authority over, in the area of what percentage to asset can you lend? You know, do you have to have 90 percent, 80 percent? Shouldn't we have an underwriting standard that says you either get--that there is recourse? Shouldn't we have underwriting standards that gives you the opportunity to either have an 80-percent or 90-percent choice or a covered loan, something like that? Isn't that really a simpler way from a standpoint of not having--granted, it would chill the ability to get a house because people who could not afford to buy the house and could not afford to pay the loan back probably would not be able to get the loan. But isn't that where we should really start this exercise, with recourse and 80 percent or 90 percent equity--10, 20 percent equity value and/or, alternatively, covered funds? I would ask everybody who actually is on the front lines of lending today.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Certainly underwriting is key, but poor underwriting is not necessarily the driver of future losses now. We are seeing loans go bad now that were good when they were made. But because of the economy--because people are losing their jobs, or retailers are having to close, or hotels cannot fill up--those loans are going bad. The economic dynamic is kicking in in terms of the credit distress that we are increasingly seeing on bank balance sheets. You are right, the subprime mortgage mess got started with very weak underwriting. It started in the non-bank sector. It spilled back into the banking sector. I think all of us wish we had acted sooner, but we did move to tighten underwriting standards, and strongly encouraged the Federal Reserve Board to impose rules across the board for both banks and non-banks. This, again, is the reason why you need to make sure that the stronger underwriting standards going forward apply to both banks and non-banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Well, what should those underwriting standards be?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","You should have to document income. You should do teaser-rate underwriting. The Federal Reserve Board has put a lot of these in effect now under the HOEPA rules. You have to document income. You cannot do payment shock loans. You have got to make sure the borrower can repay the loan if it is an adjustable rate mortgage that resets. These are just common- sense underwriting principles that have applied to banks for a long time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Or should there be recourse?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That has been a prerogative of the States. Some mortgage lending is recourse, some is non-recourse, depending on the State.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Should there be a requirement that you cannot lend to 100 percent of value?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think there is a strong correlation with loan- to-value ratios (LTVs). We actually recognize that in our capital standards that we are working on now. We would require a much higher risk weighting of loans which have high LTVs. So through capital charges, we are recognizing and trying to incent lower LTVs.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","I am running out of time unfortunately.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, I think that you are onto a very important point that I do not think has gotten the same kind of attention that it deserved and what got us here in the mortgage market, not just in subprime. I think we lost our way as a country in terms of some of our basic underwriting standards on loan-to-value and on stated income, and I think it is worth exploring having a more common set of minimum underwriting standards that apply across the board with more specificity than what we have today, which I think is what you are suggesting.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think leverage on the expectation of rising asset prices was at the heart of the subprime problem, and indeed, it is at the heart of some of the other problems that we see, to some degree, in commercial real estate, as well. So, I would try to reinforce any instinct you have to push people toward better underwriting standards, and we, as the Chairman noted, are trying to do that ourselves.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Smith","I would only add, Senator, that in the most successful period I know of in home lending in the United States, there were mainly two, maybe three varieties of loans generally in the underwriting standards world, as you say. There was a requirement of a downpayment, for standard documentation, and the people that made the loans kept them. And on the basis of that lending experience, we projected--the magicians on Wall Street did projections about the loans that weren't like that. So, I think there is--as you point out, the issue there is the issue of access to housing, and that is what it is. There is no free lunch and no easy answer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Gregg","Thank you. Thank you very much for your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Bennet.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I would also like to thank the panel for your excellent testimony. Every weekend when I go home to Colorado, what I hear from small businesses is they have no access to capital, no access to credit, and we are in this, as the panel has talked about, in this remarkably difficult period where, on the one hand, the securitized market that blew up or imploded is now gone and has not been replaced, which is probably a good thing from a leverage point of view, but it hasn't been replaced. On the other hand, we have got this looming commercial real estate issue that is still out there. And sort of caught in between all that are our small businesses who need access to capital in order to grow and in order to deal with the unemployment rate that Senator Tester talked about and sort of this folding back on top of itself. And I wondered, Mr. Tarullo, you mentioned in your testimony at the beginning your view that maybe some more direct efforts--I think you described it as temporary targeted programs--might be necessary to get our small businesses access to the credit that they need, and I wonder if you could elaborate a little bit more on that, because I suspect you are right. And in addition to that, I would ask to what extent we think the current accounting regimes are ones that are either helping banks extend credit to small businesses or are intruding on their ability to do that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Senator, I don't want to step on the prerogatives of the Congress, the Administration, various agencies that may have----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","You can step on my prerogatives. I----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","----but here is what I think. So what did we as a government, as a country, try to do with residential mortgages--not yet as successfully as I think many people would have wanted? We tried to do something about people losing their homes and to provide some mechanisms, some special mechanisms that would address those issues specifically, even as we all tried to put a foundation under the economy and get it growing again. And my thought was that something similar probably needs to be done in the small business arena, because I don't think I hear as many of the stories as you do, but I hear enough of them, because I do try to get out and talk to borrowers as well as lenders. So, whether that is trying to streamline SBA lending and make the direct lending possibilities more real, or whether it is a new program which tries to provide guarantees, I don't have a strong view on that and the Federal Reserve certainly has no view on it. But I do think that something targeted is going to be an important complement to the macro, bank regulatory, and TALF efforts that we have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Does anyone else have a view on that? Mr. Smith?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Smith","I would say in the absence of the type of a program of the type Governor Tarullo is talking about, it seems to me what clearly is needed is for small and medium-sized banks to clear up their balance sheet problems they have right now. I mean, the problems small businesses have in part are based on the fact that balance sheets have impaired real estate on them that has to be dealt with some way and that they have insufficient capital to make additional loans until that is cleared up. So until we work through--I mean, with all due respect to Senator Gregg, until the real estate, the follow-on problem of the commercial real estate problem for many of our banks is that it clogs up the balance sheets or impairs them in a way they can't make loans.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","I guess I would ask, Chairman Bair, maybe you or Mr. Smith, to what extent--I mean, I am told that in the early 1980s when we ran into trouble on agriculture, we did some things like stretch out the period of time that assets had to be marked down. And I don't want to tread into this too much, but I wonder whether, given how serious the commercial real estate problem is, whether we are in a position to unclog the assets in a way that puts banks again in a position to be able to lend to small businesses.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","You need to be careful, obviously. You want to provide flexibility to try to restructure the loans and accommodate borrowers in a way that preserves value but is fully disclosed. You don't want to defer losses. If the losses are there, they need to be realized. There is this difficult balance. You would not want to go over to the regulatory forbearance situation, which I think did get us in trouble during the S&L days. So, like anything, it is an important balance. I wish Senator Gregg was still here, because regarding the capital support for the smaller banks, the smaller banks are disproportionately a source of lending, particularly for small business. That is what they do. They do small business lending. They do commercial real estate. I am not normally an advocate for government support programs, but I do think the tremendous disparities in TARP between the 25 largest banks, with 100 percent participation, and for the smaller banks, less than 9 percent participation has created competitive disparities between large and small institutions--between the too-big-to- fail institutions where funding costs are going down, and the smaller institutions where funding costs are going up. Again, with a matching program that provides market validation that an institution is viable, markets are more willing to put more capital in. Additional capital could help balance-sheet capacity to enable more of this type of lending by the smaller banks.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Matz","Senator, I just wanted to make the point that credit unions make loans to small businesses, or club member business lending, and the average loan is only about $170,000. So they really are targeted to small businesses. In the current year, the lending is up almost $2 billion. Last year, it was up $5 billion. So, more and more, credit unions are making more and more loans to small businesses.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and as always, I thank each of you for your testimony. I always learn something when you are here. I also wish Senator Gregg was here. I think we share some of the same intuitions and concerns, and while you know I respect the FDIC and your leadership very much, I tend to hear regulators talking about them wanting assistance to the banks that they have liabilities to. I know Chairman Dugan, who I also respect greatly, very much appreciated the TARP assistance to the banks that he regulated so they wouldn't fail, and now you very much would like TARP assistance to the banks that you have depositor worries with. I just hate to hear us move into that mode, and again, I respect you both very, very much and have worked with you on lots of legislation. I do hate hearing that kind of thing. Chairman Bair, I know you mentioned the underwriting wasn't really the issue because loans were underwritten well in the past today are problems. But again, I think that was driven by the fact that we had poor underwriting in the beginning and it created a financial system issue that has really put us into this situation. So, I do think those are very much tied together. I will have to say that as we have looked at the regulatory reforms, it seems like we are just sort of rearranging the deck chairs. I mean, the issue has been always real estate in modern times. As we have had financial crises, it has always been real estate. I haven't heard anything in the regulatory reform--I know we talk about capital requirements, but the kinds of losses we have had, we would have blown through those capital requirements you all are talking about very, very quickly. We still would have needed a systemic bailout or some kind of mechanism. So, to me, that is not it. I know that we talked a little bit gratuitously about maybe we ought to put that in regulation--I mean, in laws. I can't imagine us writing laws up here that talk about what the equity ought to be in homes and those kind of things. You all don't really want us to do that, do you? So, it seems to me that actually the Fed is supposed to put out that type of guidance, is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","That is correct, Senator, and we have now, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So you are sending out guidance----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, there is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","----that says that loans, you have to have 20 percent down payment----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","This is on the consumer protection side. One of the needs to underwrite is to make sure that you are going to make an assessment based on the ability of the borrower to pay, not just on the rising value of the real estate, for example.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","But, Senator, more generally, it is not just the Fed. All of us----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Right. When it comes to safety and soundness, every regulator----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I mean, I think it would be wonderful. Let us face it. In the desire for policymakers to make sure people at every income level led the life of middle-class citizens, we promoted loan making that helped destroy our system. That wasn't the whole picture, but that certainly was a part of it. Are each of you as regulators saying that you are going to put out strong standards that really counter policymakers' desire to make sure that everybody in America has a home and a ham in their pot? Is that basically what you are saying you are going to do, because I think that is the only way, by the way, we are going to keep this from happening again, is it not?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I think, as Chairman Bair said a little while ago--she didn't say it quite in these words, but what I heard her say was, we have got to worry about problems in the future as well as problems in the past. I do think that the problems with underwriting played a very central, though not the only role, in the financial crisis. I do think we need underwriting standards for residential mortgages and in other areas----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And each of you can write those, is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And are each of you going to write standards that are dramatically different from those that got us into the situation? I mean, each of you agreed with Senator Gregg's questions, but I wonder if we are actually going to take action to make that occur.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","First of all, I want to clarify, there is plenty of bad underwriting. I want to emphasize that, the kinds of new credit problems we are seeing now are more economically driven. There was plenty of bad underwriting in both mortgage lending as well as commercial real estate. We have tightened the standards tremendously. I think we are being criticized in other quarters. Please note that we issued commercial real estate guidance in 2006.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Well, I----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","The Federal Reserve Board has issued rules that apply to both banks and non-banks for mortgage lending that significantly tighten the standards. That already has taken place. Also, we are working on capital rules that will require greater capital charges against higher-risk loans, such as those with high LTVs. The bank regulators are doing all that, and have for some time. You still have a fairly significant non-bank sector, one that can come back as the capital markets heal. That is why I hope that, going forward, in terms of whatever reforms you come up with, that those reforms will reflect the fact that there are two different sectors, two different providers of credit in this country. We can keep tamping down on the banks as we have been. But if the non-bank sector is left, by and large, unregulated, that is not going to fix the problem.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","And Senator, if I could just add, if you look at the experience of Canada where they are our neighbors and have a much more conservative standard for underwriting, where they verify income and have loan-to-value ratios that are higher, you can't get a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, but they have very high levels of home ownership and they didn't have any of these problems. So, they have more of a system that has a basic minimum that cuts across the board. It may not be the right ones for us, but I definitely think it is worth exploring.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And I would really like--I know that I am going to run out of time here and we are not going to be able to--but we talk often, I know, all of us--I would really like to see what it is we need to do on our end. I don't think we as a country have the political will to do the things we need to do to make sure that this doesn't happen again. I absolutely do not see it. I mean, this regulatory reform, again, is just moving chairs around. It is not changing anything about the way that we go about doing this business. And I hope that as we move along, you all will help with that. Mr. Tarullo, again, I thank you for your testimony, also, as always. I am wondering, on 13(3), as we move into regulation, should we--I mean, in essence, we are going to be talking about TARP and resolution and all of those kind of things down the road, but on the 13(3) issue, exigent circumstances, should we move to narrow the Fed's ability to use 13(3) for specific institutions, move away from that so that your assistance is at the system level, but where you are not specifically--I mean, in essence, you can get around--I know that some people here support the Administration's proposal to sort of codify TARP. I don't. I think we should end TARP at the end of the year. But it seems to me that under 13(3), the way you now have it, you all can work around that at the Fed and, in essence, do the same thing at specific institutions, and I am wondering if you feel we ought to limit that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","So, I would say, Senator, that I think most people at the Federal Reserve would be happy if they were not in the position where people came to us when there was a need for resolving or dealing with a specific financial institution, but I do think one needs to have a mechanism, a mechanism in law by which some part of the government can deal with the large financial institution that may be in distress. And that is why I think all three of us, certainly, have supported moving forward with a resolution mechanism that would cover the large financial institutions. I do think within the context of that, you have to address the question of potential funding streams for short-term liabilities or the sort. So, I think it needs to be addressed somewhere. It doesn't need to be in 13(3).","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","If I am hearing you properly, if we had a resolution mechanism in place, which we did not have for complex bank holding companies and others, like AIG, which is not one of those--if we had a resolution mechanism that was defined and we had the ability to fund the short term, while you are resolving that, hopefully not in conservatorship but in receivership, where you are putting them out of business, in essence, we could narrow the abilities of the Fed and also not support the Administration's proposal for Treasury to hold unto itself the ability to put taxpayer money into various entities they feel might pose systemic risk. We could do away with that if we had an appropriate resolution mechanism.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think you do need a mechanism that can provide, in appropriate circumstances, for the sort of assistance that might be needed, and if you have that, it doesn't need to be done through 13(3), and as I said, I think the Federal Reserve would prefer that it not be done through","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And you are perfectly satisfied we are resolving them out of existence? You are not talking about that assistance to conserve an institution?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think--so, Senator, that is probably one of the open questions, and exactly what do we mean, I think there is--I think what is important is that there be real prospects of losses for shareholders and creditors when their large institution gets in that circumstance.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I thank you, and I am sorry we didn't get to each of you. I do hope that what we are doing with the smaller banks, that some assistance was being sought through TARP here earlier, I hope that we are encouraging them, while they can, those who can, to raise capital. I have seen this taking place now and shareholders are being deluded and we are going ahead and raising the capital necessary to weather this storm. I thank each of you and I look forward to seeing you again soon.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Senator Schumer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing. I thank the witnesses. I would like to talk a little bit about fees and consumer protection, Consumer Protection Agency. Many of the banks we know have reacted to lost profits from their mortgage problems by raising fees on consumers, one of which is overdraft fees. There is no transparency. They don't give consumers a real chance to decide if they want--even want this kind of protection. Banks raked in about $24 billion in overdraft fees last year. That was up 35 percent from the year before. That ought to stick out. Even accounting for higher debit card use, a worsening credit environment due to the economy, that is a massive increase. It indicates to me that consumers are bearing a disproportionate burden in maintaining the health of many banks' balance sheets. They are also raising ATM fees, as you know. Bank of America recent raised its fee for other bank customers to $3. That would have been unheard of a few years ago. Maybe one of these fly by-night machines would have done that, but not a major bank. And the average cost of an ATM transaction is also now over $3. Even if you withdraw $100, that is a high fee in percentage terms, and, of course, the overdraft fees, you buy a $2 cup of coffee and they charge you $35 without even telling you. It makes your blood boil. So, my question is this. This is to really to Comptroller Dugan, Mr. Ward. As regulators, you are responsible for not only safety and soundness, but consumer protections. Maybe Mr. Tarullo also has a role here. What are you doing to ensure that consumers don't bear the brunt of banks' efforts to repair balance sheets, particularly in these two instances?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","On the area of overdraft fees, we actually don't have the rulemaking authority in that area. The Federal Reserve has that authority. They currently have a proposal that is out. We also don't have authority to write rules for unfair and deceptive practices. We have done, as regulators----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Don't you have general authority on consumer-type issues? Not at all?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Not on general fee regulation. Either it is mostly disclosure-based that is set by rules promulgated by others, or if it gets to a point where it is unfair and deceptive, yes. And in answer----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Don't you think these are unfair and deceptive----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think that it is absolutely the case that consumers should be given the right to opt in--to have a choice about whether to participate in these programs or not.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","But, Mr. Dugan, if you decided that these were unfair and deceptive, which I think average people hearing about these, they are deceptive because you don't know, they are unfair because they are so high, you could do something.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","And I think that the proposal that the Federal Reserve has put out that has not yet been adopted does address the question of consent to these programs, which is critically important.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK, the Fed, tell us what you are doing.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","That is correct, Senator. We have a proposal that we are working on right now which would go right to the heart of the issue of opt in/opt out. And although I can't obviously prejudge what the Board will do, I expect that within the next month, that is going to come up for consideration----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Has that been made public, that proposal?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes. That has been made public.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK. And what does it do, specifically?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","This would provide for the ability of a consumer to know that he or she was opting into a program like this and to understand the terms under which----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","It would let the consumer know at the time----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","----that they are in overdraft status and--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","That is actually more difficult technically, and that is some of what is out for comment right now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Well, they used to do that all the time.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","But that is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","It would not honor the request because you didn't have the money.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Right, and with the advent of technologies like debit cards, for example, it becomes more complicated than it was before. But that is one of the things that is out for comment and consideration right now, is how this might be done.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK. When did you start working on this proposal?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Let me see. I actually don't----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Not only you, but----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I don't know when the staff started working on it, Senator, and I will have to get back to you on that. I first became aware of it a couple of months ago.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Right. OK. And what about on the other issue that I mentioned?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","On the fees issue?","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","So, I don't think we have a current rulemaking on ATM fees. That has been an issue in the past, so I would have to----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Do you think $3 is excessive?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think--again, there----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Well, let me ask you another question. Has the cost from 2 years ago to now gone up so that it would merit a large increase in the fee?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I doubt that the cost has gone up very much, and so the question, as with all fees, becomes the degree to which an institution ought to be able to make that judgment if it is fully disclosed or not.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK. As you know, I think the Fed does a good job in many areas, but in consumer protection, I don't think the regulatory agencies have done a good job, and here is--I mean, maybe this is a little rhetorical. It is to me, but I am going to let you guys answer it. I mean, isn't what we have just heard a good reason that we need a strong, independent agency to protect the interests of consumers, separate and apart from safety and soundness regulators?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Umm----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","I mean, I have found that in the consumer area, the Fed and the OCC doesn't do much, although I think they have the power to do some things. It is slow. Still in the back of their mind is the idea of safety and soundness and bank balance sheets. And the consumer doesn't get all the protection he or she deserves. It is one of the reasons I believe the agency that Senator Dodd is proposing, and original Senator Durbin and I proposed, a Consumer Financial-Consumer Product Safety Commission, is so needed. Also, they are able to deal with new issues as they come up. They don't--I suppose Mr. Dugan would have to go into rulemaking and say what is unfair, what is deceptive, and they would figure out a way around that. Why wouldn't it be better to have these myriad of issues-- and our financial institutions are getting better and better at coming up with new ways to make fees--why isn't it better to have an agency exclusively devoted to that doing the job as opposed to a regulator which has many other important jobs to do to deal with? I would ask both Mr. Tarullo and Mr. Dugan, and then anyone else who would want to comment.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, as I think you know, the Federal Reserve, as a Board, has no position one way or the other on creation of the CFPA, but I would make the following observations. First, I think there are undoubted merits to having a single Consumer Protection Agency whose sole focus is on that function. Second, though, you will lose something if you do it. You will lose some of the combination of understanding of safety and soundness and consumer protection. I think there is a risk. This has not necessarily happened, but there is a risk that sometimes the impact on credit availability won't be fully understood. These are things that can be addressed, but I think that there would be costs. A third point is, as you probably also know, prior to my joining the Federal Reserve Board in January, I was quite critical of the failure of the bank regulatory agencies generally to engage in enough consumer protection on subprime, on credit cards, and many other things. I will say, though, that I think in the last few years, Chairman Bernanke has set a tone at the Fed which has been one of looking for vigorous consumer protection and that the rules on credit cards and the rules on home mortgages are evidence of that. It may not be everything you think that needs to be done, but I think it has been done.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Chairman Dugan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, I think there are two very powerful----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Comptroller Dugan.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Comptroller. That is OK. There are two very good and powerful ideas connected with the CFPA. One is to have common rules that apply to everybody, whether you are a bank or a non-bank, and to have strong authority to do that. So I think that is important. Second, I think the part of the system that had the least attention paid to it were the non-banks in terms of how rules are implemented. You don't have the comprehensive regime today. So that part, I think, can be a very good and powerful idea. The part that I have had concerns about is implementing those rules on banks and carrying them out through supervision, examination, and enforcement. I think that should stay with the bank regulators. I think that you do get a benefit from things that are interwoven together between consumer protection and safety and soundness, like underwriting standards in subprime mortgages, which are related to consumer protection issues. We see examples of it all the time, which I provided to the Committee in our last testimony. That is the part I would worry about. And then, second, the notion that the new agency should focus its implementation responsibilities on the non-banks, again, very powerful idea.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Would you just--I know my time has expired, Mr. Chairman--in retrospect, do you think the regulatory agencies, not yours in particular, but including yours--have done as vigorous a job on consumer protection as they should have?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","In the areas that you have jurisdiction over, not the non-banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Well, again, you have to sort of go area by area, but in some places, no. Other places, yes, which I think are not recognized. And I do think there has been the systemic problem that we only have a part of the pie and there is a big chunk of it that no one is looking at.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","No, that is true. That is one argument for it. Do you agree? Mr. Tarullo, how about you? Do you think your agency and all of the agencies have done as good a job as they should have on consumer protection?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I am on record saying it, so I will say it again. I don't think the agencies, including the Federal Reserve, did a good enough job.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. Thanks, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","I want to thank the witnesses once again for being here today. I look forward to working with the members of the Banking Committee as we continue to consider measures to stabilize the banking sector and our economy as a whole. This hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
