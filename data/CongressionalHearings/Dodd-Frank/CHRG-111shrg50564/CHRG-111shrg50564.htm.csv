"Speaker","Speech"
"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Let me thank all of my colleagues, and I think you all understood we intended, obviously, at some time earlier to have this hearing a little earlier. But as I think all of you may know, we had an interesting session on our side of the aisle, gathering today to listen to some of our new economic team under President Obama, as well as the President himself and others, talk about many of the issues that are confronting the country, not the least of which was the issue of the subject matter of this hearing, the modernization of the U.S. financial regulatory system. I am particularly honored and delighted to have Paul Volcker here with us, who has been a friend for many years, someone I have admired immensely for his contribution to our country. How we will proceed is, because we are getting underway much later than normal for the conducting of Senate hearings, with the indulgence of my colleagues, I will make some opening comments myself, turn to Senator Shelby, and then we will go right to you, if we could, Chairman Volcker. Then I will invite my colleagues and tell them that any opening comments that they do not make for themselves, we will include them in the record as if given. And since there are not many of us here, we can move along pretty quickly, I hope, as well. So, with that understanding, we will get underway and, again, I thank all of you for joining us here today. Today, we continue the Senate Banking Committee's examination of how to modernize our outdated financial regulatory system. We undertake this examination in the midst of a deepening recession and the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression in the 20th century. We must chart a course forward to restore confidence in our Nation's financial system upon which our economy relies. Our mission is to craft a framework for 21st century financial regulation, informed by the lessons we have learned from the current crisis and designed to prevent the excesses that have wreaked havoc with homeowners and consumers, felled financial giants, and plunged our economy into a recession. This will not be easy, as we all know. We must act deliberately and thoughtfully to get it right. We may have to act in phases given the current crisis. But inaction is not an option at all, and time is not neutral. We must move forcefully and aggressively to protect consumers, investors, and others within a revamped regulatory system. Last Congress, this Banking Committee built a solid foundation upon which we will base our work today, and I want to once again thank Dick Shelby, former Chairman of this Committee, and my colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, who played a very, very constructive role in the conduct of this Committee that allowed us to proceed as we did. Subcommittees and Committees held 30 hearings to identify the causes and consequences of this crisis, from predatory lending and foreclosures, to the collapse of Bear Stearns, the role of the credit rating agencies, the risks of derivatives, the regulation of investment banks and the insurance industry, and the role and condition of banks and thrifts. The lessons we have learned thus far have been rather clear, and let me share some of them with you. Lesson number one: consumer protection matters. The current crisis started with brokers and lenders making subprime and exotic loans to borrowers unable to meet their terms. As a former bank regulator recently remarked to me, ``Quite simply, consumers were cheated.'' Some lenders were so quick to make a buck and so certain they could pass the risk on to the next guy, they ignored all standards of prudent underwriting. The consumer was the canary in the coal mine, but no one seemed to notice. Lesson number two: regulation is fundamental. Many of the predatory lenders were not regulated. No one was charged with minding the store. But soon the actions of these unregulated companies infected regulated institutions. Banks and their affiliates purchased loans made by mortgage brokers or the securities or derivatives backed by these loans, relying on credit ratings that turned out to be wildly optimistic. So we find that far from being the enemy of well-functioning markets, reasonable regulation is fundamental to sound and efficient markets, and necessary to restore the shaken confidence in our system at home and around the globe. Lesson number three: regulators must be focused, aggressive, and energetic cops on the beat. Although banks and thrifts made fewer subprime and exotic loans than their unregulated competitors, they did so with impunity. Their regulators were so focused on banks' profitability, they failed to recognize that loans so clearly unsafe for consumers were also a threat to the banks' bottom line. If any single regulator recognized the abusiveness of these loans, no one was willing to stand up and say so. And with the Fed choosing not to use its authority to ban abusive home mortgages, which some of us have been calling for, for years, the regulators were asleep at the switch. Lesson number four: risks must be understood in order to be managed. Complex instruments, collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps designed to manage the risks of the fault loans that backed them turned out to magnify that risk. The proliferation of these products spread the risk of subprime and Alt-A loans like an aggressive cancer through the financial system. Institutions and regulators alike failed to appreciate the hidden threat of these opaque instruments, and the current system of regulators acting in discrete silos did not equip any single regulator with the tools to identify or address enterprise or systemwide risks. On top of that, CEOs had little incentive to ferret out risks to the long-term health of their companies because too often they were compensated for short- term profits. I believe these lessons should form the foundation of our effort to shape a new, modernized, and, above all, transparent structure that recognizes consumer protection and the health of our financial system are inextricably linked. And so in our hearing today and those to come--and there will be many--I will be looking for answers to these questions. What structure best protects the consumer? What additional regulations are needed to protect consumers from abusive practices? We will explore whether to enhance the consumer protection mission of the prudential regulators or create a regulator whose sole job is protecting the American consumer. How do we identify and supervise the institutions and products on which the health of our financial system depends? Financial products must be more transparent for consumers and institutional investors alike. But heightened supervision must not stifle innovation of financial actors and markets. Third, how do we ensure that financial institution regulators are independent and effective? We cannot afford a system where regulators withhold bold and necessary action for fear that institutions will switch charters to avoid stricter supervision. We should consider whether a single prudential regulator is preferable to the alphabet soup of regulators that we have today. Fourth, how should we regulate companies that pose a risk to our system as a whole? Here we must consider whether to empower a single agency to be the systemic risk regulator. If that agency is the Federal Reserve Board, we must be mindful of ensuring the independence and integrity of the Fed's monetary policy function. Some have expressed a concern--which I share, by the way--about overextending the Fed when they have not properly managed their existing authority, particularly in the area of protecting consumers. Fifth, how should we ensure that corporate governance fosters more responsible risk taking by employees? We will seek to ensure that executives' incentives are better aligned with the long-term health of their companies, not simply short-term profits. Of course, my colleagues and our witnesses today may suggest other areas. I do not mean to suggest this is the beginning and end-all of the questions that need to be asked, and I welcome today's witnesses' as well as our colleagues' contributions to this discussion and the questions that ought to be addressed. I look forward to moving forward collaboratively in this historic endeavor to create an enduring regulatory framework that builds on the lessons of the past, restores confidence in our financial system, and recognizes that our markets and our economy will only be as strong as those who regulate them and the laws by which they abide. That is the responsibility of this Committee. It is the Republican of this Congress. It is the responsibility of the administration. I will recognize Senator Shelby for an opening comment and ask my colleagues if they might withhold statements, at least at the outset, so we can get to our witnesses. With that, I turn to Senator Shelby. "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHELBY"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Today, the Committee will hear from one of this Nation's most respected economists and veteran policymakers. Dr. Volcker is no stranger to this Committee. Senator Dodd and I remember many years ago when he would come here as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. During the financial crisis in the late 1970s, it was Paul Volcker who helped put our economic house back in order, and, Dr. Volcker, I welcome you back to the Committee again. While I am very interested in the views of our witnesses on regulatory modernization, I think the hearing could be a little bit premature. Let me explain. As I have said many times and will continue to say, I believe that before we discuss how to modernize our regulatory structure, or even before we consider how to address the current financial crisis, we need to first understand its underlying causes. If we do not have a comprehensive understanding of what went wrong, we will not be able to determine with any degree of certainty whether our regulatory structure was sufficient and failed or was insufficient and must change. I understand that next week Chairman Dodd plans to hold a hearing on the origins of the financial crisis, for which I commend him. I welcome that hearing, but I believe that one hearing, or even a handful of hearings, falls well short of what these exceptional times will demand. Instead, this Committee should, I believe, and must conduct a full and thorough investigation of the market practices, regulatory actions, and economic conditions that led to this crisis. The Committee should hear testimony from all relevant parties and produce a written report of its findings. This work is crucial, I believe, if we are to develop policies that will help end this crisis and prevent it from occurring again. While I understand many people have their own views of what happened, this Committee has yet to make that determination in a comprehensive and organized manner. As a result, nearly a year and a half later, we still have not documented what started the crisis and why it became so severe. The uncertainty about its origins has not only exacerbated our economic downturn by undermining confidence in our entire financial system, but it has left us without a clear understanding of what needs to be done. We need to remedy that. Thus far, the efforts of the Treasury Department and the Congress have been ad hoc at best. When this all began, I strongly opposed the TARP bailout legislation because I believed Congress jumped right to a legislative solution without first identifying the problem it was trying to solve. Since we never developed a consensus about what caused this crisis, neither Congress nor the Treasury Department can devise a targeted solution. And as a result, TARP has drifted rudderless since it was passed 4 months ago, wasting taxpayer dollars while the crisis rages on without an end in sight. It is well past time that we investigate the origins of the financial crisis so that we can begin to lay the groundwork for a bipartisan, effective, and durable solution. In the absence of such effort, there is now talk of creating a commission to examine the origin of the financial crisis and to make recommendations for further action. At this time, I would oppose the creation of such a commission because a thorough investigation is something that this Committee can do and must do. The American people rightly expect their elects representatives, the Senators here, not unaccountable commissions to do the work necessary to solve the problems facing the country. This Committee is uniquely positioned to conduct a transparent investigation that could build the necessary political consensus around the appropriate legislative remedy that we must seek. This particular Committee has a long history of conducting such investigations. The best precedent, I believe, for this type of investigation that our current economic situation demands is the year-long investigation of stock market abuses the Committee conducted during the Great Depression. The so-called Pecora hearings produced a detailed report exposing a wide range of abuses on Wall Street. The Committee heard testimony from hundreds of witnesses, producing nearly 12,000 pages of transcripts from over 100 hearings. The investigative staff was made up of dozens of individuals and included attorneys, accountants, and statisticians. They conducted scores of interviews and sworn depositions. The Committee subpoenaed corporate records and heard testimony from the heads of Wall Street and industry, including 3 days of testimony, I have been told, from Mr. Morgan himself. The Committee's investigative record comprises 171 boxes in the National Archives. The record that the Pecora hearings established ultimately laid the groundwork for the passage of the Securities Act and the creation of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Recently, renowned economic historian Ron Chernow wrote an editorial in the New York Times calling for Congress to initiate an investigation in the tradition of the Pecora hearings. He stated the importance of such an investigation to resolving the current crisis by pointing out, and I will quote him:  If history is any guide, legislators can perform a signal service by moving beyond the myriad details of the rescue plans to provide a coherent account of the origins of the current crisis. The moment calls for nothing less than a sweeping inquest into the twin housing and stock market crashes to create both the intellectual context and the political constituency for change.  I believe that he is correct. The hearings this Committee has held to date on the credit crisis have been helpful, but I think they have lacked the focus and purpose displayed during the Pecora hearings, partly due to the Committee's lack of resources up to this time. To remedy this problem, Senator Dodd and I have already submitted an initial request for additional funding and office space for the Committee. We were recently informed that the Committee is going to receive additional funding, although not what is necessary, I believe, to conduct a thorough and fair investigation. I am hoping that our colleagues on the Rules Committee would agree that this type of effort here in the Banking Committee right now is not only necessary but deserving of their support. I believe the investigation should start by calling before the Committee all of the regulators from the past decade or more who were appointed to make sure this crisis did not happen, but it did. The Committee has heard from regulators on their views on how to solve the crisis, but it has yet to hear from present and former regulators on what caused the crisis and whether steps could have been taken to prevent it. The Committee, I believe, should supplement this testimony with an exhaustive review of the records of the regulators from that period. Once again, there will be a time to discuss what needs to be done, but before we entrust any new or existing regulator with additional responsibilities or authorities, I believe we need to know if and how our present regulatory structure failed us. After we complete a thorough review of the role of the regulators, we should then call the CEOs of the largest banks, insurance companies, brokerage firms, home builders, realtors, and other financial services companies of the past 10 years to testify. This, of course, would be preceded by an extensive staff effort to examine the activities of each institution or industry. Since the crisis began, the Committee has not yet heard from Wall Street CEOs on their role in creating the toxic assets that have spread through our financial system like a cancer. Nor have they publicly explained why their risk management systems failed or why they operated with such dangerous levels of leverage. Because many of these firms have either failed, received public money, or sought some type of Federal assistance, I believe they owe it to the American people to explain how this crisis started and what role they played in it. Last year, I called for a hearing to examine the role of underwriters in spawning the crisis. The Committee announced that it would hold a hearing to examine underwriting practices, but it was postponed and is yet to be scheduled. That hearing could now be part of this effort. Mr. Chairman, I am willing to work with you, as I have, and I believe this Committee is uniquely positioned, as you do, to perform this important service at this time for the American people. I pledge my full support should you choose to undertake your own version of the Pecora hearings, as long as they are comprehensive."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I thank you, Senator, very, very much. I would just note for the record that there have already been some proposals, including one from Senator Isakson and Senator Conrad, for sort of a 9/11 Commission--some of my colleagues may be aware of this already--to be done outside of this Committee to go back and examine that, and that has, obviously, some appeal as well. Certainly we want to examine what happened, but also we need to go forward. With that, I thank you very much, Chairman Volcker, for being with us, and for those are unfamiliar with our first witness, Chairman Volcker is the Chair of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board, Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Group of 30, and former Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Chairman Volcker worked in the Federal Government for almost 30 years, including positions at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Treasury Department, and Chase Manhattan--he has a wealth of experience. We thank you for coming and welcome you to the Committee. "
"STATEMENT OF PAUL A. VOLCKER, CHAIRMAN, STEERING COMMITTEE OF THE GROUP OF 30"," "
"Mr. Volcker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Mr. Shelby, Members of the Committee. I am delighted to be here. I want to make clear that I am appearing as Chairman of the Steering Committee of the Group of 30 and not as Chairman of the President's Economic Recovery Advisory Board this morning."
"Chairman Dodd","It is so noted. We will make that distinction here."
"Mr. Volcker","People accuse me of liking the title ``Chairman,'' but I want to make sure Chairman of what. "
"Mr. Volcker","The Group of 30 is a group of people drawn from the private and public sectors with experience in finance, and I emphasize that it is international, and this report was directed not just toward the United States, although it is perhaps most relevant to the United States. But it is directed toward authorities in any country that has extensive financial operations around the world. It does not discuss all the origins of the crisis. It does touch upon it, but that is not my purpose in appearing before you this morning. What is evident is, whatever the cause is-- and we could go into that. What is evident is that we do meet at a time, as you have emphasized, of acute distress in financial markets. Strongly adverse effects on the economy more broadly are apparent. There is a clear need, I think, for early and effective governmental programs. They cannot wait a year for attacking the immediate problems to support economic activity and to ease the flow of credit. But I think it is also evident that more fundamental changes are needed in the financial system, and they will take some time to work out. But to the extent that we have some sense of the direction of those reform efforts, I think it will help the more immediate problem. The important thing is that we do not and should not want to contemplate a repetition of this experience, and that is what this report is aimed at, and I am sure will be your concerns over time. I understand that President Obama and his people are going to be placing before you some more immediate measures. They are not the subject of our report. But when we look further ahead, I do think the more we have a sense of the longer-term future, the better place you will be for appraising the immediate actions to make sure they are consistent with what we would like to see in the longer run. The basic thrust of the G-30 report is to distinguish among the basic functions of any financial system. First, there is a need for strong and stable institutions that serve the needs of individuals, of businesses, of governments, and others for a safe and sound repository of funds, providing a reliable source of credit, and maintaining a robust financial infrastructure able to withstand and diffuse shocks and volatility that are inevitable in the future. I think of that as the service- oriented part of the financial system. It deals primarily with customer relationships. It is characterized mainly by commercial banks that have long been supported and protected by deposit insurance, by access to the Federal Reserve credit, and by other elements of the so-called Federal safety net. Now, what has become apparent during this period of crisis is increasing concentration in banking and the importance of official support for what is known as systemically important institutions when they become at risk of failure. What is apparent is that a sudden breakdown or discontinuity in the functioning of those institutions risks widespread repercussions on markets, on closely interconnected financial institutions, and at the end of the day, on the broader economy. The design of any financial system raises large questions about the appropriate criteria for, and the ways and means of, providing official support for these systemically important institutions. In common ground with virtually all official and private analysts, the G-30 Report calls for ``particularly close regulation and supervision, meeting high and common international standards'' for such institutions deemed systemically critical. It also explicitly calls for restrictions on ``proprietary activities that present particularly high risks and serious conflicts of interest'' deemed inconsistent with the primary responsibilities, I would say the primary fiduciary responsibilities, of those institutions to its customers. Of relevance in the light of recent efforts of some commercial enterprises to recast financial affiliates as bank holding companies, the report strongly urges continuing past U.S. practice of prohibiting ownership or control of Government-insured, deposit-taking institutions by non-financial firms. Second, the report implicitly assumes that while regulated banking institutions will be dominant providers of financial services, a variety of capital market institutions will remain active. Organized markets and private pools of capital will be engaging in trading, transformation of credit instruments, and developing derivatives and hedging strategies. They will take place in other innovative activities, potentially adding to market efficiency and flexibility. Now, these institutions do not directly serve the general public; individually, they are less likely to be of systemic significance. Nonetheless, experience strongly points to the need for greater transparency. Specifically beyond some minimum size, registration of hedge and equity funds should be required, and if substantial use of borrowed funds takes place, an appropriate regulator should be able to require periodic reporting and appropriate disclosure. Furthermore, in those exceptional cases when size, leverage, or other characteristics pose potential systemic concerns, the regulator should be able to establish appropriate standards for capital, liquidity, and risk management. Now, the report does not deal with important and sensitive questions of the appropriate administrative arrangements for the regulatory and supervisory functions, which agency will supervise which institutions. These are in any case likely to be influenced by particular national traditions and concerns. What is emphasized is that the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and supervision must be improved. Insulation from political and private special interests is a key, along with adequate and highly competent staffing. That implies adequate funding. The precise role and extent of the central bank with respect to regulation and supervision is not defined in the report. It is likely to vary country by country. There is, however, a strong consensus that central banks should accept a continuing role in promoting and maintaining financial stability, not just in times of crisis, but in anticipating and dealing with points of vulnerability and risk. The report also deals with many more specific issues cutting across all institutions and financial markets. These include institutional and regulatory standards for governance and risk management, an appropriate accounting framework (including common international standards), reform of credit rating agencies, and appropriate disclosure and transparency standards for derivatives and securitized credits. Specifically, the report calls for ending the hybrid private/ public nature of the two very large Government-sponsored mortgage enterprises in the United States. Under the pressure of financial crisis, they have not been able to serve either their public purposes or their private stockholders successfully. To the extent that the Government wishes to provide support for the residential mortgage market, it should do so by means of clearly designated Government agencies. Finally, I want to emphasize that success in the reform effort, in the context of global markets and global institutions, will require consistency in approach among countries participating significantly in international markets. There are established fora for working toward such coordination. I also trust that the forthcoming G-20 meeting, bringing together leaders of so many relevant nations, can provide impetus for thoughtful and lasting reform. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am delighted to have any comments or questions."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman as well. And what I am going to do is ask the clerk here to put the clock on at 8 minutes, and we will try to adhere to that so we can get around to everybody, since we have not had opening statements be made. And I will begin, then turn to Senator Shelby. Let me, if I can, begin with a couple of--sort of a broad question, if I can. The GAO report states--and I am quoting it here. It says, ``Mechanisms should be included for identifying, monitoring, and managing risks to the financial system, regardless of the source of the risk.'' What was the source of the risk in the current crisis, in your view?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, that is a complicated question that goes to some of Senator Shelby's concerns about what caused the crisis. If I were analyzing this crisis in a substantial way, you have to go back to the imbalances in the economy, not just in financial markets. But as you know, the United States has been consuming more than it has been producing for some years, and its savings have practically disappeared, and that was made possible by, among other things, a very fluid flow of savings from abroad, low interest rates--very easy market conditions, low interest rates, which in turn incited the great world of financial engineering to develop all kinds of complex instruments to afford a financing for businesses, and particularly in this case for individuals, homebuyers, that went on to exceed basically their capacity to pay. And it was all held up by rising house prices for a while, as you know, and everybody felt better when the house prices were rising, but that could not happen forever. And when house prices stopped rising, the basic fragility in that system was exposed. So you had an underlying economic problem, but on top of that, you had a very fragile, as it turned, highly engineered financial system that collapsed under the pressure. I think of it as we built up kind of a Potemkin Village with very fancy structures, but they were not very solid."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me draw upon your experience as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve System, and you correct me if my facts are wrong about this thing. But as I understand it, there are about 1,800 economists that work for the various Federal Reserve banks across the country."
"Mr. Volcker","How many?"
"Chairman Dodd","I am told about 1,800. I do not know if that is true or not, but someone mentioned that number to me. But a very high number, whether it is 1,800 or not, but a significant number of people who do research all the time in the various banks. Can someone explain to me why there was not someone sounding the alarms out of the Federal Reserve System as people who monitor and watch what is happening economically that would have sent a signal to us back in the days of, I think, in 2005 or 2006 even, that this was a problem emerging in a glaring way? Why didn't we hear?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I have to say I do not think economists are very good at this kind of analysis. In a macro world, I am sorry to say that, but I am not sure there has been much improvement over the years. But I think if there are 1,800 economists, I am sure some of them were concerned and did in their own way raise some questions. But, you know, when things are going well--this is the bane of regulation. When things are going well, nobody wants to hear about regulation and restraints."
"Senator Shelby","Absolutely right."
"Mr. Volcker","And so it is very hard to have your voice heard. When things are going poorly, everybody wants to regulate everything. And somehow we have to find a balance between too little and too much. This was an extreme case, but it is not unusual for imbalances to go along for a while without anybody really wanting to stand up and take strong action."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I would love to at some point further pursue the discussion about the Federal Reserve System and how it is working. Let me ask you, if I can as well, about the consumer protection issue. Your report describes the need to establish standards for capital liquidity and risk management for financial institutions. But do you also believe that strong consumer protections play an integral part in financial stability? I am sure you do, by the way. And if so, what regulatory structure would best protect consumers? A separate consumer protection agency, as has been suggested by some? Elizabeth Warren, who will be before us tomorrow, has made a recommendation along those lines. Distinct consumer protection missions of the prudential regulator? Which of those two options do you find----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, let me say, first of all, our report does not deal with that question."
"Chairman Dodd","You do not. I realize that."
"Mr. Volcker","Quite deliberately. But there is--obviously, this administrative question you raise is relevant. We were dealing with what we think of as safety and soundness of the system. We were not dealing with protection of consumers, protection of investors, business practices--which are related but a different function. And one of the questions--which we did not deal with, but I think the Congress has to deal with it and the administration has to deal with it--do you adopt a separate agency and a separate administrative structure for what I will call ``business practices,'' including consumer protection, separate from the prudential regulator--which is a development which is true in some countries now, and it is along the lines that Secretary Paulson proposed in his thinking about the long run. I think that is a serious issue. I do not want to express an opinion now, but I have certain sympathy for exploring it, at least, personally."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I would welcome that as you give it more thought. Last, let me address the issue of systemic risk regulation again. And I realize I am not specifically referring to the report in some cases. I am drawing upon your knowledge and expertise in these areas. The G-30 report describes one of the lessons from the current crisis as follows, and let me quote it. It says:  Unanticipated and unsustainably large losses in proprietary trading, heavy exposure to structured credit products and credit default swaps, and sponsorship of hedge funds have placed at risk the viability of the entire enterprise and its ability to meet its responsibilities to its clients, counterparties, and investors.  Three questions: Should we allow financial institutions to become large and systemically significant? Should there be a single systemic risk regulator or should that substantial be shared among different agencies? Should the systemic risk responsibility be given to the Federal Reserve, in your view? And are you concerned that it would also be a burden on the Federal Reserve with numerous divergent tasks which you and I have discussed? And I will not elaborate here. You know the point I am trying to make. And, third, are you concerned that extensive involvement by the Fed in so many aspects of day-to- day operations of the economy and the financial system might jeopardize its independence?"
"Mr. Volcker","Again, these are questions we did not deal with in the report. We dealt with the structural question that we felt these basic, systemically important institutions and banking institutions that are protected by the Government and are dealing in a fiduciary way with customers should not engage in the kind of activities that you read from the report, these highly risky proprietary activities, because it undermines potentially their basic function. When it gets to who regulates it, it is just simply not in the report. But I tell you, the kind of considerations that you raise for the Federal Reserve, or without the Federal Reserve, I think are very relevant to that decision. You will have a different Federal Reserve if the Federal Reserve is going to do the main regulation or all the regulation from the prudential standpoint. And you have to consider whether that is a wise thing to do given their primary--what is considered now their primary responsibilities for monetary policy. They obviously have important regulatory functions now, and maybe those functions have not been pursued with sufficient avidity all the time. But if you are going to give them the whole responsibility, for which there are arguments, I do think you have to consider whether that is consistent with the degree of independence that they have and focus on monetary policy."
"Chairman Dodd","I hope I am not over-reading you there. I hear that tone suggesting that that kind of a super-regulatory function would, I think, put into question the very issues that are raised by it. A systemic risk regulator might have less of a problem, in your view."
"Mr. Volcker","That is true. Then you have to consider how the systemic risk regulator matches up with the other prudential regulators. There are very interesting questions here. The G-30 issued a report, a rather detailed report, a year or so ago or 9 months ago, on different regulatory practices around the world, which raised the questions that you are raising, and almost all countries are struggling with these questions now."
"Chairman Dodd","I thank you."
"Senator Shelby",""
"Senator Shelby","I want to pick up, Chairman Volcker, on some of the area that Senator Dodd is getting into. I think it is very important. Do you have any concerns, Dr. Volcker, that if the Fed assumes too many responsibilities, its ability to conduct monetary policy could be undermined?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Senator Shelby","And what are your views on the separation of monetary policy from banking policy along the lines of the reforms that were enacted in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s that gave banking regulation to the FSA and monetary policy to the Bank of England?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, that is an interesting experience. That was rather widely acclaimed, and other countries attempted to or did follow that pattern. But then when they had a crisis, they found out it did not work so well."
"Senator Shelby","It did not work."
"Mr. Volcker","And whether that was some idiosyncratic reasons in the U.K. or whether it is a more general reason, I do not know. But the underlying problem----"
"Senator Shelby","Why didn't it work, if you could----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I----"
"Senator Shelby","I know it did not work."
"Mr. Volcker","It seemed to be a lack of coordination between three agencies involved--the U.K. Treasury, the Bank of England, and the FSA, the regulatory agency--even though they had overlapping personnel to some extent. But it seems clear that coordination was not close enough. But I would make one point in connection with your observation. Supervision regulation has implications for the performance of the financial system and the economy, and it can work in support of monetary policy or it can work contrary to monetary policy. And that is one reason for giving the Federal Reserve responsibility for both."
"Senator Shelby","Dr. Volcker, as you keep up with all this, and as a former Chairman of the Federal Reserve, you know the Fed has had a dramatic expansion of its liquidity facilities over the past year, and it has raised concerns that the Fed has moved out of the realm of monetary policy and into the realm of fiscal policy. The Group of 30 Report, as I understand it, recommends that central bank liquidity support operations should not involve lending against or outright purchases of high-risk assets. Instead, your report, as I understand it, recommends that those forms of support should be handled by directly accountable Government entities. In your view, what role should be given to the President or the Treasury Secretary in approving Government bailouts or other support for institutions that will likely involve taxpayer dollars?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, in cases where they do involve risk and the use of taxpayers' dollars, we are pretty clear that the administration, particularly the Treasury, ought to be involved in that decision, and the Federal Reserve should not undertake those kinds of actions, if they do it at all, without the concurrence of the administration."
"Senator Shelby","Is this in the line under our constitutional system that it would be inappropriate for unelected central bankers to determine whether a company or industry receives a taxpayer-funded bailout? Shouldn't those decisions be made by the President and the Congress, who are accountable to the people? Is that----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, Congress can provide a framework for making those decisions, but I think they do involve political questions that the President and the administration should be involved in. I think just to clarify, my own understanding from outside is when the Federal Reserve has done this recently, they have worked closely with the Treasury. They have not gone off on their own and undertaken these measures."
"Senator Shelby","It seems like a new role for the Fed than when you were Chairman."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, it is a non-traditional role."
"Senator Shelby","Non-traditional role. You are very----"
"Mr. Volcker","The report takes a traditional view of the functions of the Federal Reserve."
"Senator Shelby","Dr. Volcker, recently Stanford economist and, somebody you know, a former Under Secretary of the Treasury, John Taylor, argued that excessively loose monetary policy during the first part of this decade caused the financial crisis."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I do not think I am going to get into that question this afternoon. I do think that conditions in financial markets which were related to the large balance of payments deficit, large current account deficit, and the free flow of money from abroad laid the groundwork for many of the excesses in the market."
"Senator Shelby","Now, this is in your report, as I understand it. One of the key recommendations of the G-30 Report is creating a failure resolution regime that imposes discipline--that is, actual losses--not only on managers and shareholders but also on sophisticated creditors. I believe one of the primary failings of the recent bailouts of the GSEs, AIG, and Bear Stearns was the intent of protecting any creditors from losses. Dr. Volcker, in terms of who qualifies as a ``sophisticated creditor,'' do you believe that both financial institutions such as investment banks and foreign central banks would count as sophisticated creditors? Or should?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, they individually are sophisticated, yes. Whether they need to be protected in some particular occasions is another question."
"Senator Shelby","Given that the large creditors of the GSEs, AIG, and Bear had no legal claim to being bailed out--which they did not--what specific mechanisms would you suggest that we think up here to put in place to assure that such sophisticated creditors take losses in the future, which helps bring discipline to the market?"
"Mr. Volcker","The premise of your question included the GSEs?"
"Senator Shelby","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, the GSEs, I think, if I may say so, with the connivance of the Congress, were considered to be something special and they would be protected. And there was a general understanding, rightly or wrongly, while officially they did not have the full legal requirement of a guarantee, through the years----"
"Senator Shelby","But they had the implicit guarantee, didn't they?"
"Mr. Volcker","Pardon me?"
"Senator Shelby","The implicit guarantee."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, they had an implicit guarantee and that was----"
"Senator Shelby","Was that because they were hybrid----"
"Mr. Volcker","----I think, generally understood."
"Senator Shelby","----you know, stock owned and Government sponsored?"
"Mr. Volcker","We are very clear on one recommendation in this report. We should not have that kind of hybrid institution anymore."
"Senator Shelby","I totally agree with you."
"Mr. Volcker","You know, you cannot change it overnight, but I think as we design a new financial system, we ought to avoid that kind of compromise that is going to get you in trouble. That does not mean that Congress or the Government cannot support the mortgage market if they want to."
"Senator Shelby","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","But they ought to do it directly."
"Senator Shelby","Yes, sir. Thank you. Thank you, Chairman Dodd."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much."
"Senator Warner",""
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Volcker, I have got three questions, and I think they follow up on both the Chairman's and Senator Shelby's approach. It seems from the report a clear understanding that there needs to be some level of regulation of some of these institutions that fell between the cracks. Yet it seems that even though major money center banks that clearly were regulated followed the market to start putting out these same kind of complex new instruments, your term of ``over the top financial engineering.'' I guess on a going-forward basis, as we move forward to some new structure, even with regulation and transparency, is that going to be enough or should there be some point of an evaluation, almost a societal value evaluation, of some of these instruments, whether the extra ability to price that risk down to the last decimal point is worth all of the side risks that we have seen taking place by some of these instruments?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, we do a lot of talking about the importance of risk management and so forth, but, in essence, the conclusion that we have is that some of these innovations and some of these very risky activities are almost inevitably going to get ahead of the regulators, and these basic institutions--the big commercial banks, in particular--are of systemic importance, therefore should not get involved in those activities. They are too risky, and I think it is clearly demonstrable they involve conflicts of interest that add to the uncertainty and risk."
"Senator Warner","So you would see some system whereby there might be bright-line prohibitions----"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, I see--we suggest some bright-line prohibitions for hedge funds and equity funds, and you asked me about proprietary trading--you did ask me about proprietary trading. I think these big financial institutions probably have to have some capacity, do need some capacity for trading. But if they have very aggressive trading in very large amounts, where it is not quite such a bright line, you probably need special attention, and we suggest special attention via special capital requirements if they are going to engage in those activities."
"Senator Warner","And as you said, sometimes these instruments get ahead of the regulators, and how do you----"
"Mr. Volcker","No question about that."
"Senator Warner","You do not want to stifle innovation, but it seems to me that some of these instruments recently were more about fee generation than they were about appropriately pricing risk?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think that is true, but there is plenty of room for innovation outside of the basic banking system, and that is a distinction we make. All kinds of sophisticated capital market techniques, a derivative explosion which may have gone too far, but the whole idea of securitization could be developed outside the banking system. To the extent it is inside the banking system, we say, well, the bank should hold onto what they securitize. That is a traditional function. But outside, they can engage in all kinds of trading and----"
"Senator Warner","But wouldn't you say some of these outside functions now need to have some kind of regulatory----"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, well, I guess we are trying to say we want to go relatively lightly, if they are relatively small institutions without systemic significance. But if they get big enough--and some of the hedge funds have, and we had the experience of Long Term Capital Management in the past where, rightly or wrongly, people thought it had systemic implications. Then you have to think about leverage requirements and capital requirements and liquidity requirements. I myself think that would just be a handful of those institutions, and most of them--we do call for reporting and registration, but I do not think they would take heavy regulation."
"Senator Warner","Well, let me follow up on Chairman Dodd's question as well, one of the points he raised. A lot of your focus is on systemic risk. We have heard the comment a lot in the popular press, you know, certainly these institutions are ``too big to fail.'' On a going-forward basis to try to alleviate that systemic risk, should there be some examination of sizing of some of these institutions?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, well, we make a fleeting reference to that actually in the report. There is now more concentration than you ever had in the United States. The degree of concentration is not as great as many foreign countries have, but it is very large from our history. And I think that is a question you want to ponder. It has got political, obviously, as well as economic circumstances, whether there is such a thing as not only ``too big to fail,'' ``too big to exist.''"
"Senator Warner","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","And it has got--we certainly have seen how difficult it is to manage these institutions given the variety of functions they have been performing. Now, we suggest that their functions be simplified. That would be easier to manage. But, still, there is in present law, as you know, a limit on deposit-taking. I think it is 10 percent. You cannot go beyond 10 percent. Back when I was Chairman, we once suggested 5 percent, which some people thought was too big. Now it is 10 percent. You know, it raises a question at some point. When is enough enough?"
"Senator Warner","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","And I think you ought to look at it."
"Senator Warner","One last question. Over the last decade, as somebody who spent some time in the financial markets, there has always been the argument, oftentimes from our friends in the U.K., you know, to come over to their markets. Wall Street was complaining that if there was additional regulation, we would see a flight of all these firms abroad, development of new money centers all around the world with not as stringent a regulatory structure. In light of this complete worldwide collapse, do you think there will be an ability to come up with some strong international standards? Or are we going to be able to patch this over and still have a few 2-years later, 5-years later, a rush to the bottom as firms try to go around the world to find the least regulatory----"
"Mr. Volcker","I think we have had a real wake-up call, here and elsewhere, in Europe, Japan, China. And this wake-up call I hope is strong enough so that we will emerge from this with consistency and the basic regulatory and supervisory framework. If it does not, I would still do what we think is appropriate here and let them go if they want to be in----"
"Senator Warner","Even if we have a regulated system, you could make the argument that might be the safer system."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, and I think in the long run--suppose we now had a strong regulatory system, and it was Europe and Japan and elsewhere that was in worse shape. All the money would be flowing into us because it was the strongest system. Now, unfortunately, that is not the case right now. But it should be the case. What should be the case is we have a high degree of uniformity. And I do not think that is impossible. You already have that pretty much in the capital area. Now, that is just one area. You have got a lot of other areas--the hedge fund regulation, rating agency regulation, accounting is one place where I am sure--I have a special background here, but I think we should have uniform accounting around the world."
"Senator Warner","If I just follow where you are headed, you would actually say a strong regulatory system with appropriate oversight in this country would not be counterproductive to the continued growth of capital markets in the United States. It might still be a long-term benefit to our country."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes. That does not mean you want unproductive regulation. Good regulation we ought to have, regardless of what the rest of the world does."
"Senator Warner","All right. Thank you, sir."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. I asked someone once, ``Why do you think it is that the world comes here?''--talking about, obviously, not the present day, but a little time ago. ``Why does the world come here and bring its wealth?'' The answer I was given, two reasons: one, we are very good at making money, and as importantly or more importantly, it was a safe place to be. You might make a bad bet, but you were not going to lose your money because the system was corrupt or did not work. And I think that is the point that Senator Warner is making, and I think if you have a strong, sensible, balanced regulatory system, the world could also follow us. They may not join us, but they will move in that direction."
"Mr. Volcker","I have hopes that, given what has happened, you will get some uniformity. You know, the argument always was we will lose all this business to London. Well, London has got the problem at least as much as we have, and I think that is generally recognized at this point."
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Johanns."
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In reference to your last comment, I will offer an observation, and that is that the financial crisis is bad enough; where I do think there is a good chance of uniformity, just as you suggest, I think over time it is hard to sustain that. Why? Just simply because one country is going to look at this and, you know, when things stabilize--and hopefully they will stabilize--that country is going to say, you know, we could get more banking business here if we tweaked this a little bit and tweaked that a little bit. So you almost need to think about what mechanism you have in place to deal with that economic phenomenon. Countries want business, and they are going to do things. Sometimes over time we see it is bad judgment, but I would just offer that observation. A couple more observations, and then I would like to ask you a question. It seems to me--and this is so complicated. It is hard to say there are a couple of reasons for what is going on, but it seems to me that there are two really, really important things that really have led in a substantial way to this financial crisis. Number one is whatever mechanism was in place to evaluate risk accurately just failed. Highly compensated, enormously bright people being advised by the best in the business simply lost their way when it came to evaluating risk. The second thing was that, for whatever reason, as regulatory agencies or departments tried to get a handle on this, it was very difficult for them or they dropped the ball, or whatever, in terms of themselves blowing the whistle on unreasonable risk being taken. Those two things strike me as really fundamental to what we are dealing with here. If you agree with that statement, I would really be interested, Dr. Volcker, in your educating us on how your recommendations would deal with that, number one, the failure to accurately evaluate risk and, number two, the failure, for whatever reason, to blow the whistle on that risk."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, we have got a lot of rhetoric in this report about the importance of risk management and trying to deal with the problem you have and the failures of risk management in our leading financial institutions--partly, and importantly, because the complexity became so great that we lost sight of how to measure the risk. Now, I have got a point of view on this, but the markets were taken over by financial engineers. They were mathematicians. They were not market people. They somehow thought that financial markets would follow the laws of physics or some natural law and everybody had a nice, normal distribution curve. And they kept being surprised by outlying events. Well, they seemed outlying if you thought of the world of a normal distribution curve, but that is not the world of finance that I know. Financial markets are affected today by what happened yesterday, and what is happening right now affects thinking and affects what happens tomorrow. So you get people going to extremes in both directions. And these financial engineers kind of thought that they had the answer to how to measure risk and take care of it. Things were very complex. When you mixed together these enormous compensation practices, the enormous gains possible, with obscure financial engineering, you had a recipe for extremes, I think, that kind of came back to haunt us."
"Senator Johanns","If I might just----"
"Mr. Volcker","That will be addressed by what is happening, but so much of the best talent in the United States is going off into financial markets. I wish more of it would go building bridges instead of financial markets."
"Senator Johanns","If I might just offer another observation, and your thoughts on compensation, I think, really warrant this Committee kind of digging deep on that issue. But there is another piece to it, too. There was a point in time where someone was compensated based upon the quality of the loan that they wrote. You know, when I bought my first house, you didn't get that loan unless you had a reasonable chance of continued employment, you had 20 percent down in the bank, et cetera. However, the compensation structure turned to how many loans you could write and bundle and then sell, and like I said, nobody was figuring out how to evaluate the risk, or if they did, they threw all the rules out the window."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think that is a good example. In the old days, you had a customer. You evaluated his ability to pay, the value of the house, and so forth. But then they came along and said, well, look. If we put 80,000 of these loans together, our statistical analysis says 85 percent of them will be OK and the result was you put poorer and poorer loans in the package. It turned out that 85 percent were no longer good, and that is where we are."
"Senator Johanns","And the frustrating thing about that, and I will wrap this up, for the average citizen out there is that 15 percent now has been labeled toxic assets and somehow the taxpayer feels like they are being imposed upon to own that risk today and they are saying, ``why me?''"
"Mr. Volcker","I don't know how you want me to respond to that----"
"Senator Johanns","You don't have to respond, Doctor. You are----"
"Mr. Volcker","There comes a time when you have to support these institutions in the interest of the greater good and the stability of the markets. But one of the difficulties in this whole business is very much commented on today, is how you price those assets when the taxpayer takes them over. It is possible you could think of a scenario where if the taxpayer has to take them over and the markets are stabilized, the taxpayer may actually make money. But you certainly don't want to go into it with the taxpayer unnecessarily losing a lot of money. But it is a very--this is all complex enough so it is very hard to unscramble all this stuff."
"Senator Johanns","Thank you very much."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. Very good questions. Senator Reed?"
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairman Volcker, for not only your testimony, but for your service on this G-30 Commission as well as so many other commissions. We have been confronted with a long to-do list by the G-30 report, but our capacity is limited. I wonder, could you focus on what you consider to be the top two or three systemic risks that should be dealt with immediately? A sense of priority, I think, would help--I will speak for myself--would help."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, when you say immediately----"
"Senator Reed","Well, immediately in the----"
"Mr. Volcker","First of all, we are going to have--I am not sure this is what you meant in asking the question--it is going to cost more money to deal with this financial crisis. There shouldn't be any mistake in your mind about that, that this has deteriorated to the point where it is going to take Government support in the interest of overall economic stability and recovery, and it is going to be lots more billions of dollars. I don't know how many. But that is necessarily a priority, which I hope and believe the administration will face you with shortly. Now, looking ahead, I think we rather put the priority in what I put in my statement as our first point, that you have got to take these big protected institutions, particularly the large ones, but all the banks are going to be protected to some extent, and you have got to develop apparatus for protecting, but you have also got to limit what they can do, and you want to do that as intelligently as you can, because you want them to compete. You want them to be innovative in providing services. But you don't want them taking a kind of risk that is inconsistent with the fact that at the end of the day, Government support is in the background. Now it is in the foreground. But ordinarily, it is in the background. And I think that is the, I think, the most fundamental thing. But there are so many things that need attention that it is hard for me to rank them in priority. The accounting problem is a real one. And apart from the fact of the desirability of uniformity, and there has been a lot of progress in that area. That is one area I think we are going to get uniformity, and we should get uniformity. But then uniformity is one thing, but uniformity according to what standard? And there, there is a problem with all this mark to market business and fair value accounting. When should that be applied? When should it not be applied? If it is not mark to market, what else do you do? My own feeling is that is something that has to be thought about by the regulators themselves and they ought to have a voice in the accounting for the basics, banking anyway, banking, insurance companies. But intellectually, that is a very tough problem."
"Senator Reed","Let me ask this related question. We are debating a significant recovery package at the moment. That, I would think, would complement any efforts we make to further aid the financial institutions, because without this recovery package, then the potential hole has got to be much bigger. Is that your view, also?"
"Mr. Volcker","That is right. No, you have got kind of a three-legged stool. You have got the stimulus package to help provide direct support to the economy. You have got to have the financial package to unleash the flow of credit. And then related to both those things, I think you have got the individual mortgage problem, which nobody has figured out how to deal with very effectively, but it is an important part of the problem. So you have got to advance on all those fronts."
"Senator Reed","Let me----"
"Mr. Volcker","Let me just point out----"
"Senator Reed","Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Volcker","----the obvious. If you didn't have the stimulus package, let us say, the worse the economy gets, the more problems you are going to have in the banking system. That is obvious."
"Senator Reed","And the bigger the hole that has to be filled."
"Mr. Volcker","The hole gets bigger."
"Senator Reed","In the G-30 report, the reported noted that credit rating agencies are not held legally accountable for their ratings. Do you believe that has to change?"
"Mr. Volcker","I believe this is an area that has to be reviewed. We made a few suggestions in the report, including the one that you mentioned. I don't feel that that is the last word, frankly, what we say in this report. The whole compensation structure is important and we allude to it, but we don't say what the answer is. I am not prepared now to say I think I know the answer to that, but it is not an unimportant question, obviously."
"Senator Reed","Let me ask you a final sort of set of questions. The Chairman raised the issue of 1,800 economists at the Federal Reserve. Did anyone sort of notice the implications of the housing bubble building up and other problems? The Ranking Member has talked about sort of looking into the regulatory practices of the Federal Reserve, particularly regulating these large institutions. My assumption is that on a daily basis, the Federal Reserve would have hundreds, perhaps, of examiners within these institutions. Why wasn't anyone aware of some of these off- balance sheet devices, liquidity puts? Was it an area of concern? Was this an issue they were aware or, or were they completely blindsided? I think it goes to the point of trying to discover who knew what when so we have an idea of how we can restructure the----"
"Mr. Volcker","I do not know the answer to your question. A perfectly reasonable question. I was not there. I can't answer the question."
"Senator Reed","That is a perfectly reasonable response. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. Senator Bennett?"
"Senator Bennett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Dr. Volcker, welcome. We have had three simultaneous bubbles. They haven't burst simultaneously, but they were going on simultaneously. We have had the housing bubble. We had the oil bubble. And then we had a credit bubble. The oil bubble, everyone who pumps gas is delighted that it has burst. Everyone who produces gas and oil is probably a little sorry that it has burst. But all of the dire consequences that we heard predicted with respect to the oil bubble are now no longer on the front page and we no longer talk about the oil shock and its impact on the economy and the rest of us because the price----"
"Mr. Volcker","What about the opposite? The price isn't high enough to stimulate the----"
"Senator Bennett","That is right. It has gone from $145 a barrel to $35 a barrel and then bounced around. But that is a bubble that burst and a collapse that happened very rapidly and the American motorist is delighted. The housing bubble has burst and we don't know where the bottom is. It is uneven across the country, and that is why I am a little suspect of the Case-Shiller number, because that takes the worst parts. There are some places in the country where housing prices have actually risen, but the mortgage problem remains very much a difficulty because nobody knows what the securities are worth. They don't know how much toxic paper they have, and so on. Let us talk about the credit bubble. It is different from the classic bubbles of the housing bubble and the oil bubble, but we still don't have a firm handle on what is happening with respect to credit. We don't have any kind of normalcy. There was a time when credit was enormously available. Now, it is almost not available at all, except again, like the housing thing, there are some parts of the country where it is available, or there are some markets where it is available and others where it is not. Look into your crystal ball and tell me, or tell us what it is going to take for the credit bubble to resolve itself and how long you think that might be."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I won't profess to know the answer to that question with any reliability. It is going to take some time. We are not at the end of this business. And I think the immediate challenge is to provide some basis for greater confidence in the banking system and in lending. You know, it is kind of a spiraling process. The worse the economy gets, the less confidence there is, and the less confidence there is, the more difficult creditors and the worse the economy gets. So we have got to break into that cycle, and I think that is why I emphasized earlier the importance of dealing with the banking situation. It is going to cost some money. And if we do that effectively, then I think we could begin seeing the end of this. But it is, I don't know how many months, but it is not going to be overnight."
"Senator Bennett","It is not going to be soon----"
"Mr. Volcker","We have had a great shock to confidence and trust in markets and these markets depend upon confidence and trust and it is going to take a while to restore that."
"Senator Bennett","It is not going to be soon and it is not going to be cheap."
"Mr. Volcker","And it is not going to be cheap."
"Senator Bennett","Now, since you have put your finger, I think, on the real core of all of this, which is confidence, you talk about a three-legged stool, a stimulus package, something, for want of a better summary term, I will call more TARP to deal with the financial institutions, and then resolving the mortgage crisis. I am perfectly willing to go down all three roads, but what happens if we pass a stimulus package that is not stimulative? Doesn't that produce a greater hit to the confidence circumstance than if we did nothing? That is what I think the debate is all about. I don't subscribe to those who say, well, we want the economy to fail because then Obama will fail and then the Republicans will come back. This is one Republican who rejects that, absolutely, and for the good of the country. But it is one thing to say, let us pass a stimulus package. It is another to be sure it is going to be stimulative. It is one thing to say, well, let us shore up the financial institutions. Then it is another thing to be sure that the way we do that is going to be helpful, and so on. Can you give us your advice as an economist as to what you think is the most stimulative?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I want a stimulus package that stimulates."
"Senator Bennett","Well, we all stipulate to that."
"Mr. Volcker","To the extent--you know the dilemma here--to the extent you can take action that not only stimulates but is in accordance with some longer-term needs of the economy, obviously you are sympathetic toward that. I am sympathetic toward that, and that, among other things, leads you to infrastructure."
"Senator Bennett","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","The problem is, that takes time. So what do you do in the immediate future? There are things that are very compelling in the short run in terms of helping people that are out of work in terms of unemployment compensation and other things where there is the pressure of immediate money in their hands. But when you take those two different kind of extremes, both useful, put it together in as good a package as you can and get it passed, would be my advice. I am not an expert on all the particulars of this program. I haven't looked at it. But I am aware of the debate. But I hope that gets resolved in a constructive way as quick as you can."
"Senator Bennett","I have talked to some bankers who say, well, the injection of capital that has come as a result of TARP is not only welcome, but essential, but we still do not have sufficient capital to make any loans. We have sufficient capital to sustain our present balance sheet, which we didn't have before. But we are unable to attract any private capital and we are unlikely to get any more public capital. Do you have any prescription for us as to what we should be doing there with respect to----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I don't know what the administration is going to propose, but I suspect there is going to need to be some public capital----"
"Senator Bennett","And then----"
"Mr. Volcker","----maybe quite a lot of it."
"Senator Bennett","Then the question arises, in what form? The first TARP, for which I voted, contrary to my friend, Senator Shelby, was sold to us on the basis that it was going to acquire the toxic assets and clean up the balance sheets of the bank, and then it changed toward a program of buying preferred stock or making some other kinds of loans, warrants, and so on. Along with Senator Dodd, I agreed we ought to give the Secretary of the Treasury full authority to do whatever he thought was best, but the track record, at least coming from somebody's analysis, has been a little bit spotty as to whether that is----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think it is fair to say, if you look back over the last 6 months or so, that they were kind of repeatedly firefighting, on some crucial weekends in particular, and it may have been successful or unsuccessful in particular cases, I think mostly successful in putting out a particular fire, but it didn't come across as being very consistent and very credible in terms of what comes next and I think we have suffered from that. And what we need now is, I think, a kind of comprehensive program that recognizes the breadth of the problem--it is not just one or two institutions--and provides a framework for dealing with this in a consistent way. I think that is essential to get confidence back in this situation. I hope that is what is going to happen in the next couple of weeks."
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Bennett. Just a quick question before I turn to Senator Schumer. In your view, Doctor, looking back, did we do the right thing in early October in supporting that TARP program or not?"
"Mr. Volcker","You know, it is very hard to sit on the outside and say what should have been done in particular circumstances. All I know is something had to be done. Whether it was perfect foresight or whatever, we could have done it differently, you mentioned the TARP program, which was designed in the first instance--I had actually written something about it before it happened and suggested that we get rid of some-- buy up some of these so-called toxic assets, and that was the original intention and then they switched, maybe for good reason. But the whole thing wasn't as persuasive as it might have been. Now understand, as time goes past, these loans are getting worse. They are not getting better because the economy is worse, so that makes it more difficult."
"Chairman Dodd","So the answer----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, the answer, as I say, I think you need, apart from the stimulus program, you need a program that looks big enough, powerful enough, across the board enough, not that it necessarily has to be applied, but you have something there that can be applied in terms of further deterioration of the market or individual institutions. You hope that by the mere fact of being there, confidence might begin to be restored. The better looking the program, the less you have to use it."
"Chairman Dodd","So I think I hear you saying, yes, you agree that it should have been done. How it was executed is another matter. Is that a fair characterization?"
"Mr. Volcker","I think--yes, I think so."
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Schumer?"
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,"
"Mr. Chairman","It is good to see you. I have been on Banking Committees for 28 years and I think you have been testifying before them for about 28 years."
"Mr. Volcker","Just about."
"Senator Schumer","So it is good to see you. I have an opening statement, Mr. Chairman. I am going to forego reading it. It outlines my general views on regulatory reform, including a much more unitary--well, controlling systematic risk, ensuring stability--I have always thought all holding companies should be regulated by one regulator, maybe the Fed, maybe not, but one regulator, and I know you have been asked about that--unifying our regulatory structure--we have too many regulators, too many holes between the cracks, too many conflicting organizations. Third, regulating the currently unregulated part of the markets, both instruments and entities, hedge funds and others. We need to do that. Fourth, to recognize that we are in a global financial world, global solutions, and increase transparency. Those have been my five principles. I wrote an op-ed about this about a year ago and I have been sticking with them. It hasn't changed. So I ask unanimous consent that that be put in the record."
"Senator Schumer","I would like to focus on the international part first, because to me, the biggest challenge we face when we set up a new system of regulation is not what we do here. I think there is sort of a consensus. I mean, I have heard Chairman Dodd has said, Chairman Frank, the administration, they are very similar to the five things that I have outlined here. But how in this international financial world, with a national system of regulation, don't you always flee--doesn't money always flee to the lowest common denominator? And if we regulate swaps here or regulate hedge funds here, they just migrate to a place where they are not regulated because the individual operators, regulation is a common good."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I expressed some optimism on this point earlier, before you came in----"
"Senator Schumer","Good. Well, I welcome hearing again, because there isn't much----"
"Mr. Volcker","I have optimism only because this crisis is so serious. We here in this country, in the U.K., in Japan, potentially in China, have never seen anything like this, and so this kind of focuses the mind. I think the leaders in Europe and the United States, Canada, Latin America, they are all interested in this subject. You have a forum in the G-30. I don't think it is an ideal forum for this purpose, frankly, for getting into the detail, but it is a good forum for making sure that somebody else does it. And we do have some international bodies that are making progress. In many of the areas that you would be concerned with, take hedge funds, the Europeans are more concerned about regulating hedge funds than we are."
"Senator Schumer","You know, I am not so worried--I mean, although the details, look how long it took to get some agreement on Basel and the capital accords."
"Mr. Volcker","Right."
"Senator Schumer","Everyone had general agreement and it took five or 10 years to get this done."
"Mr. Volcker","Now wait a minute, I was largely, or importantly responsible for the first so-called Basel Agreement. It only took 2 years."
"Senator Schumer","Right, but Basel II took much longer."
"Mr. Volcker","The revision took much longer because we did such a good job the first time. "
"Senator Schumer","But, you know, in this new global world, Hong Kong could decide that they don't want the Western consensus. They will go for the short-term hit of having----"
"Mr. Volcker","I----"
"Senator Schumer","You know, it is just difficult."
"Mr. Volcker","Look, one area where this is front and center is in accounting----"
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","and I have a special interest in this because I used to be the Chairman of the International Accounting Standards Committee."
"Senator Schumer","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","And there, the suspicion in the United States has been our U.S. GAAP is better than anything else and that we have international accounting standards and we ought to adopt U.S. GAAP. Well, I think that has been proven to be a bit of an illusion. U.S. GAAP is not God, either----"
"Senator Schumer","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","and there are lots of problems, and I see no reason--I do not believe that the international standards are in any sense weaker than GAAP. They are more principle-based-- "
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","----but in terms of the substance, they are no weaker, and there has been a lot of progress. Now, there are political pressures on the international standard setters and we ought to be alert to that and those pressures, frankly, are--well, they are in the United States, too, but they are particularly strong in Europe, and I think we all have an interest in maintaining the independence of the standard setters and we want to put pressure on them to do a good job."
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","But I think that is a promising area and a very difficult area."
"Senator Schumer","Yes, it has been difficult, the most difficult. My worry is a year from now, when we begin to see the light at the end of the tunnel here, say China will decide they want to gain the immediate advantage and just set up rather sophisticated----"
"Mr. Volcker","No, but we----"
"Senator Schumer","----trading operations, and it just----"
"Mr. Volcker","We said----"
"Senator Schumer","My experience----"
"Mr. Volcker","We said earlier, if we have got good regulation, and good is not synonymous with a lot of regulation necessarily, but if we have intelligent regulation and the rest of the world doesn't follow us, well, that is too bad, because I think in the end, it will be recognized that we have the best and the business will come here. I am tempted to say, because this is not the first time I have been before this Committee and this problem arising in the United States, where when you talk about--the Senator talked about everybody wants to tweak the regulation to their advantage."
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","That is true of American States. They are always trying to tweak----"
"Senator Schumer","Of course."
"Mr. Volcker","----financial regulation to the advantage of particular States. So we have had a certain experience there. But all I can say is if we can't deal with this now, given the extent of the problem not just in the United States----"
"Senator Schumer","Around the world."
"Mr. Volcker","----but around the world, we have an opportunity to do it."
"Senator Schumer","Yes. I agree, it is a unique opportunity. It is just my experience has shown everyone agrees 10,000 feet up, and you start getting into the details and they don't, and then there are new instruments that come along and new opportunities for one country to gain on the other and they trade that short-term benefit to everyone's long-term detriment. But good. I am glad you are optimistic."
"Mr. Volcker","One thing I would say in that connection, maybe I am optimistic and out of it and don't know what is going on, but there are bodies----"
"Senator Schumer","I doubt that."
"Mr. Volcker","----internationally to deal with this, and to the extent it can be left to these more or less expert bodies, and accounting is one example, but the Basel Committee is another example----"
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","----and there are several other examples, the political leaders ought to put pressure on those expert groups. When they try to do it themselves----"
"Senator Schumer","I understand."
"Mr. Volcker","----I think you get a problem."
"Senator Schumer","All you need is one significant outlier to throw off the--to toss up the apple cart. One other question, because my time is running out, credit rating agencies, where there has been real trouble. Do you think the model ought to change, that we ought to----"
"Mr. Volcker","I mean, I can answer that question yes. But if you ask the next question, how----"
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","----I will tell you, I am not ready to make a pronouncement. I think that----"
"Senator Schumer","Well, what about the old model, where instead of the issuer paying for it, it was the investor that did?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I was surprised to learn, or I had forgotten, because ever since I have been compos mentis and an adult, I think the AAA ratings or AA or whatever they were, but 20 or 30 years ago, they were paid by the investor."
"Senator Schumer","Exactly. Yes, and it worked."
"Mr. Volcker","And it worked. It seemed to work. So why can't it work again? I don't know the answer."
"Senator Schumer","The one--and this will be my last, because my time is expiring--the one thing people say is that when the investor pays, the investor doesn't want to make it public and there is sort of a public good."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Senator Schumer","What would you think of some quasi- governmental intervention here?"
"Mr. Volcker","I can't see the governmental agency making the credit rating. The potential political pressures that will come on, everybody----"
"Senator Schumer","Well, that is why I said quasi. Don't you think the Fed is pretty well removed from political pressures?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think the Fed is more removed, properly so----"
"Senator Schumer","Yes, it should be."
"Mr. Volcker","----than any other agency, and I like to think it has earned that in part over time by competence in the way it acts. But I don't think you just want to pile everything on the Federal Reserve. At some point----"
"Senator Schumer","Yes."
"Mr. Volcker","----it breaks."
"Senator Schumer","Well, to clarify, my view would be to go back to the investor-paid initially. We have got to do something to change it."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I agree with that."
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","I won't ask you to comment on this, but since your knowledge and background in accounting, the FASB model, and I realize they are very different functions we are talking about here, but a FASB model has worked fairly well in accounting standards, particularly when we got away from the industry supporting it and financially underwriting it."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, that is--the IASB is the FASB model writ large internationally."
"Chairman Dodd","So there is a value in maybe talking about that model, as well. Senator Crapo has been, of all the members of this Committee, probably has worked as hard on Government regulation, reform regulation as any member, so we welcome your continuing participation in the Committee, Mike. Thank you."
"Senator Crapo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Volcker, I want to go back to the Group of 30 report just to kind of try to understand maybe in a little more detail with you what was intended by it. I am going to first focus on one of the concepts that Senator Schumer mentioned--I apologize for my voice, I might lose it during the questions-- and that is the principle of unifying our regulatory system. For some time even before we ran into this crisis, I have been arguing that we need to unify our regulatory system and really make sure that we had the right regulatory system for our financial system and for our capital markets. In that context, as I look at what we have today, it seems to me we have a lot of overlap that is unnecessary. We have gaps where there is no regulation where there should be. And we have weaknesses in some parts of our system. And what we need to do, as I think you said earlier, we need to get good regulation, not necessarily a lot of it. We have got to be thorough. We have got to cover everything, and in my opinion, eliminate overlaps. As I look at the first principle of the Group of 30's report, it talks about dealing with gaps and weaknesses and so forth in the system. But one of your first points is that the activities of banks should be subject to prudential regulation and supervision by a single consolidated regulator. Do I understand you or the report at that point to be talking about something like merging the functions of the OCC and the OTS and perhaps other regulators?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, we deliberately did not get into the specifics. We were at a high level of generality when it came to the administrative arrangements. But we do recognize the problem that you just described and that you had to have some kind of a unified system, at least for banks."
"Senator Crapo","And when you say at least for banks, I noticed one of your other points was that the activities of large insurance, investment banks and broker dealers require consolidated supervision. Are you not saying essentially the same thing there in other contexts?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I can't say, speaking in the report, we were saying the same thing, because we deliberately didn't want to get into the detail. I think it is an important subject, but we were concentrating on what the substance of the regulation should be. At some points, we said it should be consistent. But we didn't opine about who should do what."
"Senator Crapo","Well, let me try to take you there, and you don't have to speak for the report right now. A lot of discussion has been made about whether we should have a single regulator like they have in England, whether we should have three regulators, one for the systemic, one prudential, and one consumer protection----"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, one of----"
"Senator Crapo","Do you agree with those approaches or that idea of consolidating?"
"Mr. Volcker","I think you should at least explore the idea of two regulators, which was raised by Secretary Paulson's report a year or so ago, that you have one on so-called business practices and consumer protection and investor protection and one on prudential safety and soundness concerns. They overlap. They are not entirely separate, but there is substantial difference between those two approaches. In fact, there is enough difference in approaches you will get a clash between those agencies. But maybe that is healthy----"
"Senator Crapo","Right."
"Mr. Volcker","----instead of just having one. Now, you take the English pattern, they went all one way and away from the Central Bank. Now, that didn't work so well in terms of crisis. So how do you get----what we did say very clearly is whatever system you have, you had better get the Central Bank involved enough so they can respond effectively to a crisis."
"Senator Crapo","And that is consistent also with Secretary Paulson's blueprint----"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Senator Crapo","----in terms of the suggestions made there?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Senator Crapo","One other point that was made in the report is that the money market mutual funds that were wanting to continue to offer bank-like services should be required to be reorganized as special purpose banks. Could you expand on that a little bit? What was intended by that?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, what was intended by that--you go back in history a little bit. Money market funds developed because-- to escape regulation, effectively. This is a way to provide a banking service outside of banks, and they had some competitive advantages because they weren't banks and they didn't subject to banking regulations. So when a crisis came along, the framework was not adequate. In some cases, they were owned by rich parents and it was OK. When they weren't owned by a rich parent, you had a collapse with widespread repercussions. We said, you should not essentially say we should not have institutions out there that promise to act like a bank, but they are not regulated and protected like a bank. And if they are going to be protected de facto, which is what happened here, in effect, they got a free ride, and they shouldn't have gotten a free ride. So if they are going to act--if they are going to talk like a bank and squawk like a bank, they ought to be regulated like a bank."
"Senator Crapo","Well, one of the principles that I tend to follow as I approach this issue is that similar products or similar functions should be regulated with the same rules or by the same regulators. Would you agree with that principle?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think if you adopted that regulation on money market mutual funds, the natural thing would be to have the same regulator as the banking regulator."
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. One more thing I would like to ask a little clarification on and that is your comment and the report's comments about the way we should handle our GSEs, Fannie and Freddie. You indicate that a clear separation of Government financial support from the private profit-seeking sector of this should be done. It is not clear again whether you are saying that we should nationalize the Fannie and Freddie functions or whether we should withdraw the Federal guarantees or accomplish the Federal guarantees in some other way. What exactly are you saying?"
"Mr. Volcker","We are saying that is your choice. You ought to do one or the other. "
"Senator Crapo","All right."
"Mr. Volcker","You shouldn't leave them hung up in between, because it is confusing and when you got into trouble, were they public agencies or were they not? And if they were acting in the public interest, were they doing right for their fiduciary responsibility to the stockholder? I think they got placed in an impossible position. They were supposed to be important constructive factors in the mortgage market. The crisis came along and they were so over-extended in pursuit of their stockholder interests that they couldn't perform the public function. And if they performed the public function, their stockholders would squawk. And you shouldn't permit that to happen."
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much. Just one last question, and really, this is sort of a summary to go back to what we have already talked about and that you have already expressed a comment on, but I would just like to explore it a little further with you, and that is it seems to me that right now, depending on whether you count the FDIC, there are six or seven Federal regulators with overlapping responsibilities in some cases, and as I said earlier, gaps in some places and so forth. It seems to me that regardless of the specifics, that Secretary Paulson's blueprint, the Group of 30 report, even though it didn't get into the details, and a number of the other reports that have dealt with this same issue have all concluded that we have too complex a system that needs unifying and simplification. Now, whether we go to a single regulator or whether we go to a smaller number than the seven that we have now, that we need to simplify and reduce the number of regulators and clearly identify the functions they are regulating and then move forward from there. Is that general statement something you could agree with?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, I agree with that, but I guess what I would say is when you get to that stage, that stage ought to be second. I don't mean it should be way off, but you ought to have some feeling about the substance of the regulation and then decide who should do it rather than decide who should do it and worry about the substance afterwards."
"Senator Crapo","Agreed, and in that context, just to help me in my mind, I am starting to think of that substance part of it as something focusing on systemic risk, prudential regulation, and then consumer protection, and there may have to be some other insurance aspects or whatever."
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Senator Crapo","But would that tend to be the kind of thing you were talking about?"
"Mr. Volcker","I think it is one of the possibilities, yes. A good possibility."
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much."
"Mr. Volcker","The report doesn't say so, but----"
"Senator Crapo","I understand. I understand."
"Chairman Dodd","No, and let me just say, too, I appreciate Senator Crapo's longstanding involvement in this and I think we are sort of heading in the same direction on a lot of this. Obviously, the devil is in the details, a lot of it, but you are getting sort of a consensus emerging up here and some ideas and thoughts in this direction. That is why your testimony is so tremendously helpful. I can't--first of all, I don't disagree at all about the conflicting missions of the GSEs of protecting your shareholder interests and the public policy notion of housing. I am struck by the notion that we are sort of doing--aren't we doing the same thing now? When I look at Citi and Bank of America and Goldman Sachs and the infusions of massive amounts of taxpayer money, once again, now you have got the exact same situation we talked about with the GSEs. In effect, we have a massive amount of public money going in, so that we are setting public criteria on private institutions. What is the difference?"
"Mr. Volcker","Well, the difference, I hope, is that this is a reaction to a particular emergency and it is transitional and nobody is thinking you are keeping it that way."
"Chairman Dodd","All right. I hope so."
"Senator Crapo","You are right, and I hope so, too."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just also, and Senator Shelby had to go on to another meeting, let me just in a sense respond and ask, as well. I mean, look, we obviously know that we have got to go back. We are reviewing all the time how we get here. We are asking everyone what their thoughts were on how this happened and it is a very important question. None of us disagree with it. As the Chairman of a committee here, and all my members serve on other committees, as well, and we have obviously got a very important agenda to deal with, not the least of which is the modernization of the regulatory structure and some sense of urgency, I happen to believe, and I think you have implied this, if there is any silver lining in all of this right now, it is that I think there is a willingness and an understanding that we have to move. In the absence of this moment, if this were, quote, ``normal'' times, I think we would have a hard time engaging in this debate and discussion because of the vested interests that don't want anything to change at all. So we have been given a moment, unfortunately, here, tragically, I might add. But it is a moment. Now, what do we do with the moment, and my fear is that if I end up squandering a year going back and reviewing for the next number of months how we got here--not an illegitimate question--that I may miss the moment, and I will look back and this Committee will look back and say, we had an opportunity. Recognizing the moment, we need to do something about this. And so I respect immensely the idea that we ought to spend time, and I want to move carefully, obviously, and deliberately. But my concern is if we miss the moment, we will find ourselves in a deeper hole for a good many years to come. So let me ask you, Doctor, if I can, do you sense that, as well? Should this Committee and the others responsible, obviously the House and the President, the executive branch, move? And again, as I sensed it, your priority would be to deal with systemic risk up front and soon. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, you know, with all deliberate speed."
"Chairman Dodd","I agree."
"Mr. Volcker","I am not enchanted by, you know, talking about combining the SEC and the CFTC. It is an important issue, but do that as part of the whole thing. Just don't pick out particular issues like that, in my view, but I----"
"Chairman Dodd","Deal with the totality of it. And an issue that Senator Crapo brought, and I care about, as well, is sort of the forum shopping that went on by the major interests that restructure themselves in order to pick out a regulator. It is all backwards, in a sense. We should be determining who is going to be regulated, not you choosing who you are going to be regulated by, and that has been a constant problem, as well. So as I hear you say it, the systemic risk would be the area you think we ought to be aggressively pursuing, carefully but aggressively pursuing. Am I correct?"
"Mr. Volcker","Yes."
"Chairman Dodd","Do my colleagues have any additional questions? Senator Warner?"
"Senator Warner","One quick question. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I had to step out for a moment, so if Senator Crapo asked this question, I apologize. One of my questions earlier was about the argument over the last decade, if we added more regulation, how the capital markets would migrate elsewhere, and it seemed like, and I was one of those folks who held up what looked like the model in the U.K. as maybe one to go after. Clearly, it has not proven to be all it was made out to be. Is there some other--as we think through this, is there some other nation around the world that has got a regulatory structure that you say, hey, as you think through this in America, look at country X or country Y?"
"Mr. Volcker","I hate to make an advertisement for the Group of 30, but we just issued a big report on that subject. We described, I don't know, what, two dozen countries, different systems. We refrained from saying which is best, but we did pronounce a lot of pros and cons, what looked more promising and the advantages, disadvantages of different systems. There seems to be some intellectual and other movement toward what the Senator was describing of two agencies, one for business practices and one for prudential. I can't claim that that is widespread, but there are two or three countries, or four or five countries that now follow that. For a while, this business of putting everything in one agency seemed to attract a following. That enthusiasm has been a bit dampened by the fact it didn't solve all the problems in the U.K. But those are the two alternatives that need to be looked at. The United States is big enough and complicated enough, we may have a system like nobody else's, but I don't think anybody is very happy with the system we have and it takes this kind of a crisis to change it."
"Senator Warner","Well, you could, Dr. Volcker, maybe you could share with the Chairman at some point which of those countries you think might be models or might give us some guidelines or lessons we could learn from."
"Mr. Volcker","We do have--your staff can, I am sure, look at the report we have on that subject because it does try to describe the strengths and weakness of different approaches. And there is a pretty strong feeling, which is not the case in the United States historically, that similar functions should be subject to the same regulator and the same regulations, which is----"
"Senator Warner","So focused on function rather than on institution?"
"Mr. Volcker","Than by institution, yes."
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Dr. Volcker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and Doctor, we thank you immensely. Let me just recommend, as well, and I am sure you will agree based on your last comment, why don't we make available the staff of the Group of 30, and for any interested members and their staffs, we will try and set something up and have a session where they can go through and do exactly that, get into more details and the questions back and forth as part of our ongoing effort here. It might be very worthwhile and we will arrange that to occur, as well. And I should have said at the outset, by the way, and I apologize, Doctor, you and the Group of 30, the people who are involved in this, I know the names are listed in the report itself, but I want the record to reflect how much we appreciate that effort. This was a very comprehensive effort made to examine this----"
"Mr. Volcker","Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","----and it is appropriate that our first witness in a series of hearings we are going to be having on this subject matter comes from this very group that brings a wealth of knowledge and expertise to this subject matter. We are going to hear from the GAO and staff, who have also been involved in this. I am going to bring them up here shortly, but I want the record to reflect how much we appreciate that effort. You have begun a very important discussion, obviously not a completely comprehensive one, but one that touches on the very major issues we will have to address in the coming days if we are going to effectively respond to the challenge of modernizing our regulatory structure, so I thank you."
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think I can speak for my colleagues that engaged in the study that we appreciate your interest. We feel it was worthwhile, so----"
"Chairman Dodd","Well, this is the moment. This is the moment. We have been given, unfortunately, a moment."
"Mr. Volcker","And just in terms of all this competition between countries and so forth, this is an international report."
"Chairman Dodd","I know that."
"Mr. Volcker","There is no sharp cleavage between people from different nationalities."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. We will leave the record open a little bit. There may be others who couldn't be here today who would like to maybe submit some ideas and questions to you, as well, and if you have a chance to respond to those. We thank you."
"Mr. Volcker","Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","I will invite our second witness up, our second panel. Welcome to Dr. Gene Dodaro, who is the Acting Comptroller General of the U.S. Government Accountability Office, the GAO. Mr. Dodaro has worked for over 30 years in a number of key positions at GAO, including Chief Operating Officer. He will also be testifying tomorrow before the Committee on the Troubled Asset Relief Program, so he is a busy man with being here today and tomorrow. Mr. Dodaro will be accompanied by two GAO staff members, Rick Hillman and Ms. Orice Williams. We thank you for joining us, as well. Why don't you come on up and sit with--have both of you come up and sit there, because I know you worked very closely on the details of all of this and I know Mr. Dodaro would appreciate having you sit there with him, as well, and respond to some of this. Again, we thank you very, very much. I am sorry about the delay, but obviously a lot of questions for Dr. Volcker. So we welcome your comments, and again, congratulations on this. All of us have great respect for the GAO and the work you do, but this is a very important effort you have put forward and sort of a template for us to begin this very important discussion of regulation modernization. "
"STATEMENT OF GENE L. DODARO, ACTING COMPTROLLER GENERAL, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE"," "
"ACCOMPANIED BY RICHARD J. HILLMAN, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE; AND ORICE M. WILLIAMS, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE"," "
"Mr. Dodaro","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to appear before you and the members of the Committee this afternoon to assist your deliberations on the financial regulatory system. As you mentioned, we in this report embarked on an effort to assist this Committee and the Congress in tracing the evolution of the financial regulatory system over the last 150 years, how it has evolved; to talk, second, about some of the developments in the market that has really challenged that regulatory system; and to put forth a framework to help guide decisions on how to craft and evaluate proposals to change the system going forward. Our bottom line conclusion is that the current system is outdated, it is fragmented, and it is ill suited to meet the 21st century needs of our nation. There are many reasons for this. Three I would point out, trends that we identified in the report. First is that the regulators have struggled and often failed to mitigate the systemic risks of large interconnected financial conglomerates or to adequately ensure that they have managed their own risks. There is no one single regulator charged with looking at risk across the financial system. This, as mentioned in the earlier discussions today, is a problem that needs to be addressed. Second, regulators have been confronted with some large market participants that are less regulated. Non-bank mortgage lenders, credit rating agencies have been mentioned here. They are two that we point out in our report, as well. Third, both the regulators, consumers, investors have all been challenged by the emergence and growth of complex financial instruments, whether it is collateralized debt obligations, credit default swaps, over-the-counter derivatives. All these products have really evolved and introduced new dimensions into the system that really outpace the regulators' ability to be able to handle that. Now, going forward, we think that action needs to be taken. It needs to be deliberative, as pointed out here in the discussion so far. And in order to assist this, we outline nine characteristics in our report which we think are good touchstones. First is that the regulatory goals need to be clear and articulated in statute, and the goals really ought to drive the substance of the organization, as Dr. Volcker mentioned earlier, and they ought to be in statute so that they can be used to hold the regulators accountable going forward and can provide consistency over a period of time and ensure that there is consistency in the regulation going forward. Next, it has to be--reform has to be comprehensive. The current institutions and products that, where there are gaps, the gaps need to be closed and it needs to be looked at in an interrelated set of, as has been mentioned, in a unified basis going forward. System-wide risk needs to be addressed. Somebody needs to be in charge of making sure that the system-wide risks are monitored going forward. It needs to be flexible and adaptable, and by that we mean it has to allow for innovation, but somebody has to be staying abreast of risks that are emerging going forward. We know where the risks are now. What shape they will take in the future is really anybody's guess at this point, but we need to have a monitoring system in place that can triage those risks, make determination, not be totally reactive to the situations going forward. It needs to be efficient and effective. By this we mean there is overlapping jurisdictions right now that can be consolidated or looked to to consolidate so we have an efficient system going forward. Consumer protection has to be also a paramount consideration here. Every time we have evaluated an activity for this Committee or another committee in Congress in terms of whether it is credit card fees or whether it is mutual fund fees, the disclosures invariably aren't adequate enough going forward, and I believe there also needs to be more attention to financial literacy concerns. The Federal Government has a commission on this, but it hasn't been--had a strategic plan, been resourced properly. That needs to be part of the package, as well. The regulators have to have the right authorities. They have to have proper independence, and that involves the funding sources that they draw upon to ensure that independence going forward. And last, taxpayer exposure has to be minimized. We believe that whatever structure is put in place, that future failures are borne by the cost of the market participants and not by taxpayers going forward. An example here is what is set up currently in the Bank Insurance Fund, where fees are paid and then institutions, if they fail or are taken over, then the fund is recapitalized by the participants in the fund and not by taxpayers going forward. Now, to your point about seizing the moment, one of the things that we did in order to highlight attention to dealing with this issue was add the need to modernize the financial regulatory system to our most recent update for the High-Risk List that we keep for the Congress and unveil at the beginning of each new Congress, and this is important because we have added areas in need of broad-based transformation as one of the criteria to be put on the High-Risk List. We think it was important to do that, to feature this as the attention of need of change both by the executive branch and importantly by the Congress, in this case, through legislative initiatives. So that sort of concludes my opening statement. My colleagues and I would be happy to answer any questions that you have."
"Chairman Dodd","I must say, you are always a spectacular witness. That was his testimony given without reading, and your comprehensive knowledge of your own report is pretty impressive. You have testified before us on numerous occasions and you always do an excellent, excellent job, and so I command you and your staff for your depth of understanding and appreciation of the issue. Am I to understand, by the way, when you listed the list, the list is not necessarily in the order of importance, because consumer protection comes sort of at the mid-point in that list and I don't interpret that to mean that that is less important than the first issue you raised."
"Mr. Dodaro","That is correct. Basically, these nine characteristics all have equal value. The only thing I would say is we list the regulatory goals articulation up front, which could include--and should include--consumer protection as sort of an overarching starting point. But other than that, they are all of equal importance."
"Chairman Dodd","And the last comment you made is I understand to be that you believe this ought to be a high- priority item for this Congress, the 111th Congress."
"Mr. Dodaro","Definitely."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Let me, if I can, begin with the first question I asked Dr. Volcker, because again, while obviously we are looking forward here, Senator Shelby's point, whether you want to have this Committee do it or someone else do it or however, and I think you can walk and chew gum, that we can actually do both functions maybe simultaneously, that is analyze how we got here as we decide what steps to take going forward, is an important question. And so the question I asked Dr. Volcker was, I will repeat, and that is your, in fact, the report here states, and I quote here:  Mechanisms should be included for identifying, monitoring, and managing risk to the financial system regardless of the source of the risk.  What was the source of the risk?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I think, you know, basically the three areas that I pointed out in terms of these developments that have occurred that have outpaced the ability of the financial regulatory system. It depends on how you want to frame it. Our report frames it in terms of market developments compared with the regulatory system. Our report is not a comprehensive inventory of every, perhaps, poor decision that was made by individual regulators or by companies or by other institutions going forward. Clearly, that is worthy of investigation. But our point was that there are these broad trends, and these trends, you know, we have seen emerge over a period of time. In 1994, we issued a report on the problems that were emerging in derivatives. In 2004, at the request of this Committee, we issued a report talking about the need to modernize the financial regulatory system. So a lot of the need to change the system, I believe has been emerging over a period of time. It was definitely brought to the forefront over this past year in the scope and dimensions of the problem. But I think there is enough basis of study being done that could begin to build the record that Senator Shelby was talking about. But until action is taken, we continue to have these exposures and vulnerabilities, and I don't think, you know, some of this can proceed on a parallel path."
"Chairman Dodd","I agree with you, as well. Let me--the structure of the financial regulation. Again, we have heard a lot of different ideas today. I keep sensing some commonality among members up here and I would like to raise, if I can, in order to address the problem, should we consolidate regulatory agencies? If so, which agencies should be consolidated and what public policy goals would such consolidation achieve? Is there a role for maintaining a State- Federal system of optional bank charters, for instance, in your view? What are the advantages and disadvantages of creating a Federal insurance regulator? We are debating up here, and this subject has been before us, on the Optional Federal Charter. A lot of people think there is not much debate over life issues. There is a significant debate over property casualty issues of how we go. What are your thoughts on those questions?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I will ask Mr. Hillman to comment on the insurance industry. He has done a lot of work on that area. But in terms of your first question about consolidation, some of our work in the past, in the banking regulators agency, we raised the issue of the potential benefits of merging OTS and OCC and perhaps the supervisory responsibilities of the FDIC as a potential area that ought to be examined going forward. Obviously, many people have mentioned the SEC-CFTC potential issue going forward. But my point would be, at this juncture, those decisions need to be made in concert with identifying who the systemic regulator would be, because the relationship between that regulator and the other regulators that may have more specific prudential responsibilities, I think needs to be thought of in a holistic fashion. Otherwise, we are going to put in place another potentially fragmented system to replace a fragmented system that we already have."
"Chairman Dodd","So get to the systemic risk issue first?"
"Mr. Dodaro","First, and then in parallel with that decide how to make the other system support that, and it will also help the systemic risk regulator because they won't be having to deal with as many other entities going forward and it does address the issue of regulatory arbitrage that you mentioned earlier, Mr. Chairman. But Rick can comment on the insurance area."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes."
"Mr. Hillman","The notion of an alternative national insurance regulator is something that is deserving of significant merit, that we need to best understand the tradeoffs associated with that. But in recent years, the preponderance of evidence, particularly amongst the larger insurance companies, suggests that they are at a disadvantage compared to the banking and security sectors in that the banking and security sectors can bring new products to the market more swiftly that are similar to products that are also being sold by the insurance industry. However, the insurance industry, rather than having one or a small number of regulators to get product approval, has 54 separate regulators from the 50 different States and four different Territories. So the idea of having some commonality associated with the introduction of products of similar nature in the marketplace is something that deserves close attention."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Well, it does and this Committee cares a lot about it. What about the State-chartered versus federally chartered institutions?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I think what we have seen and observed over time, the State function, particularly as it relates to consumer protection, has provided an important safeguard and we think the benefits of that need to be preserved going forward. There needs to be obvious coordination in this area. There are--it is important always to have some checks and balances in the system, and I think the Federal-State issue is one of the important checks and balances that needs to be maintained in a revised system. Most of our work is focused on the Federal level, of course."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me jump, if I can, to the issue of failing institutions. The GAO report suggests that a regulatory system should have adequate safeguards that allow financial institution failures to occur while limiting taxpayers' exposure. Can you give us an example of some of those safeguards?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I mentioned, alluded to one in my opening statement. The Bank Insurance Fund, I think, is the model that we have in mind going forward here extended across the system whereby the banks pay fees into the system. The fund is then capitalized. There is a statutory ratio that is set, and if the fund falls below that ratio, FDIC has a number of years in order to recapitalize the fund----"
"Chairman Dodd","Right."
"Mr. Dodaro","----but that is done by the financial institutions in the system and not supported by taxpayer funds. I mean, that was something that was modernized during the savings and loan and banking crisis we had in the 1990s."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes."
"Mr. Dodaro","We think there ought to be something like that more broadly speaking in this system so that the taxpayers aren't turned to to provide anywhere near the level of investment that we are being asked to provide today."
"Chairman Dodd","The former SEC Chairman, Bill Donaldson, once warned against executive compensation plans that emphasized rewards for short-term financial targets, and I quote him here. He says, ``People with targets and jobs dependent on meeting them will probably meet the targets, even if they have to destroy the enterprise to do it,'' end of quote. I wonder if you might explain the relationship of compensation to risk taking, particularly when oriented toward short-term goals and discuss how they should be addressed."
"Mr. Dodaro","This is an area that we haven't studied extensively going forward, but clearly the role of incentives here are important going forward and you are seeing some of that. We point some of that out in our report in terms of the number of mortgages lent, for example, and the incentives systems build into it. So I think that is an area that needs a lot more study and attention, but clearly, the incentives in the corporate governance aspects of this can't be overlooked going forward."
"Chairman Dodd","So the issue of proxy voting and so forth on compensation issues, it has been discussed a little bit in the past, but to what extent shareholders at what level have a right to participate in making--first of all, they find out invariably a lot of these contracts are entered into and you don't discover all the details of them until someone is leaving."
"Mr. Dodaro","Mr. Chairman, let me go back and look at what we have done in the past. I don't have a ready answer for you on that today and we will provide one."
"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate it. I thought you might, but it was one I wanted to raise. Let me turn to Senator Johanns."
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A couple of thoughts. Having run a State government from the Governor's office and having a Director of Insurance which I appointed and regulating insurance at the State level, I will tell you, and we were a fairly small State population-wise, at least, that there was a closeness of regulation there that never got very far away from you. Now, I compare that with having run a Federal department, very large, 110,000 employees in 75 foreign countries. We regulated a whole bunch of things. These regulatory enterprises can be so big and the diversity so enormous around the country that what happens is exactly what your report points out. It just breaks down. And so when you start comparing State charter versus Federal charter, et cetera, I think we have to keep that in mind. I really do. Having run both, I can tell you, a department that regulates on a national basis is always going to fight that battle. That is my observation. My question, though, deals with kind of a follow-up on this whole issue of risk analysis. How do you figure out that this basketful of assets has value and what is its value and what exposure do you want to take to that risk? I would like to hear your thoughts on that. Is this something where you would suggest that our regulatory framework have kind of a pre- approval feature to it, because once the investments are made, the horse has pretty well galloped out of the barn, if you know what I am saying. I would just like to hear your thoughts about that."
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes. Clearly, the risk management failed at several levels in this situation. It failed at an institution level. It failed at an industry level. It failed at the national level and at an international level. I think the breadth in which this moved across the globe, I think really surprised a lot of people. At the request of Senator Reed, in his capacity as a Chair of one of the subcommittees of this Committee, we are looking at risk management practices going forward and I will ask Ms. Williams to give you a little bit of an outline on what he has asked us to do, and we will be reporting on that shortly. But this is an area that I think is really in need of attention going forward. This is the role that we would see the systemic risk regulatory playing, to monitor the developments and to make that decision. And I think you are going to have to rely on the regulators to make the decision as to whether to intervene or not. There is the possibility perhaps of allowing pilots to go forward without it being system-wide. There are other cases where you may want to be watching it, monitoring it for a while very closely. But this risk management that we have in mind needs to be an active risk manager, not over-reactive, but not under-reactive, as well. Orice?"
"Ms. Williams","Basically, what we are going to do on this engagement, we are looking at risk management oversight. We are specifically interested in what the Federal regulators do when they look at risk management at an institution, how they actually go about examining that particular aspect of a financial institution, and then we are looking at how the regulators identify risk that they are going to focus on in an examination, because they do risk-based examinations, to see how often risk management bubbled up in the past several years up to the current point. And then finally, we are looking at the resources that are dedicated to the examination function across the banking regulators, as well as the SEC."
"Senator Johanns","One other thing I wanted to ask you about as you start to look at this is the whole issue of offloading risk, and maybe there is no solution to that, but it seemed to me this system got created in such a way that the premium for me as the broker was to write the loan at all costs, whatever I could do to get that person to sign on the dotted line, then it is packaged and it is sold off and the risk goes to somebody else and somebody else or whatever. I would really like to hear your thoughts on how to deal with that, because--and maybe that gets back to the issue of valuation again. But to me, that seems to be an important element as we think about what we want to do with the regulatory system."
"Mr. Hillman","When you go back a decade or more, the process that depository institutions typically followed in funding mortgages is they would have their own underwriters review the competency of individuals to pay those loans and they would go through a detailed process before making a decision to provide a loan to an individual. Once that decision was made, they would hold that risk or hold that loan on their books themselves. Today, most oftentimes that is not the case. The case is a model of originate to distribute, where institutions are making decisions and receiving a fee for that service and passing that risk on to others. This originate to distribute model is one of the reasons why we have resulted in the crisis that we are in today and some say that additional attention is going to be needed in the future to help to ensure that at least some responsibilities are being held by each of the individual parties along the way to ensure the appropriateness of decisionmaking at each of those levels."
"Senator Johanns","Can I often one last piece to this? That piece would be the thought of rating the risk. Is that an appropriate governmental function? For example, if my bank wants to go out and originate junk in the hopes of marketing it, we should call it that. If, on the other hand, they are following a model of caution and due diligence and doing the very best they can to make sure that those loans are going to be repaid, that should be viewed differently. But the important thing is, how do we let the consumer know that? How do I, Mike Johanns, going in to make my deposit, how do I know that those practices have been employed, so if I buy their stock or invest my money in that stock or whatever, I am an informed consumer? These are complicated issues, but I think that is what we are trying to get to here, is to protect the consumer."
"Mr. Dodaro","I think basically the answer to that question, Senator, I think involves safeguards at various levels. You need to have the regulators in the examination be clear that the institutions are following due diligence, good practices; second, there is proper disclosure; and then third, there is education, and then a consumer protection safeguard in place. So it is a very important question. It runs--the threat of it runs through all these various areas that we are talking about. I don't think there is one solution to it, but it is something that needs to be looked at on a comprehensive basis because it is pivotal to the decisionmaking that takes place within all these various levels of institutions and products."
"Senator Johanns","We have run out of time, but my final thought, Mr. Chairman, is this. If we don't figure this piece out, the mechanism won't make a bit of difference. We can create this. We can put it under the Fed. We can do whatever, whatever, but if you don't solve that piece of it, then they are almost guaranteed to fail as a regulator and we will be back to reports like you just wrote."
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, and basically, that is why we set out those characteristics, because if you address all the characteristics, we believe you will get at this issue. This isn't just the question of moving boxes around and solving a problem. It is not anywhere near that simple."
"Senator Johanns","I went over my time, so thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","No, you didn't, Senator. You just made a very, very valuable point to me, because if there is that common denominator, as Mr. Dodaro just described that thread, I believe it is consumer protection. I think we have operated for far too long, over the last number of years, where there has been a notion that consumer protection was antithetical to economic growth, that if you were talking consumer protection, you were creating hurdles, barriers to economic growth. And the painful lesson we have all learned in these last number of months, several years now, is that when consumer protection is foremost in your minds, what happens to that investor, what happens to that customer who walks in, if you are guarding and watching out for them, that you can avoid the very problems we got into. We didn't watch out, that is we, the regulators, the Government itself, was not watching out for what happened to that purchaser of that mortgage. We were assuming somehow that the system was taking care of them, and they weren't, and so they got cheated in the process. When you abandon the consumer in your analysis of all of this, you put economic growth at risk, and I think your question is right at the heart of it. We just move boxes around here and create different structures and make it look more simple, but without providing that kind of protection, coming back to the notion that protecting the consumer is absolutely essential for economic growth and the avoidance of the very situation we find ourselves in today, I think is an excellent point. Thank you for it. Senator Warner?"
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dodaro, nice to see you again and, again, compliments on initiating this report and listing it as a top priority for the Congress to take on and the country to take on. I want to follow up on Senator Johanns' point. One of the areas that has been suggested--and I do not know if you all have weighed in--is if you are originator of one of these mortgages or one of these loans, you keep a stake in the game, that you cannot sell off 100 percent of that risk. Have you taken a position or do you have a comment on that ``stake in the game'' notion?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Now, we have not looked at that particular issue, Senator."
"Senator Warner","Mr. Chairman, that is one way, if you are not taking the whole--selling off 100 percent of the risk, as Mr. Hillman mentioned earlier. A decade ago the bank, the originator of the loan, would keep that loan on its books and have a long-term obligation. As they have been securitized and sliced and diced, that connection and bond between the lender and the lendee has disappeared. And one proposal is reconnection and making sure that if you originate, you keep some skin in the game."
"Chairman Dodd","Absolutely."
"Senator Warner","But let me also follow up on, I think, your appropriate point about protecting the consumer, and it is kind of, again, from a--I keep coming back to, you know, this kind of way we approach this. My concern is, Mr. Chairman, that we clearly need to do a better job of protecting the consumer, but I think we have operated on the premise that transparency and disclosure alone would be enough to protect the consumer. And it seems like we have had two contradictory policy goals. On one level, we want to protect the consumer. On the other level, as we push out these more challenging mortgages or credit cards, the population that we are dealing with are oftentimes the least financially literate. So what I question, even with more focus on financial literacy programs, is whether disclosure alone is going to get us there and, you know, will there need to be some type of restrictions--again, I come back to my bright lines--on certain products that if you are not, for example, a qualified investor--I spent 20 years in the venture capital business. You know, to invest in my venture capital funds, which were high risk, you had to be a qualified investor. Do we need to have, in addition to--if we are going to truly protect the consumer, in addition to disclosure and transportation, are we going to need actually some bright-line prohibitions?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I definitely think that the systemic regulator that we are talking about would fulfill that function, or at least that could be one of the functions they fulfill, is to assess the risk level, and there have to be tolerances put in place and balances and decisions made on a case-by-case basis as to whether the risk--you know, assuming you have these clear goals of consumer protection as one of your goals, along with, you know, allowing innovation and capital formation. But, I mean, all those things have to be balanced. But I think you definitely need that in place. I agree with what you are saying, that, you know, disclosure, transparency alone are not going to be enough. I think you need to have it sort of from one end to the other. One is the regulators need to be protecting the consumers as well as allowing for innovation, all the way through transparency, disclosure, down to educating people more to make them more financially literate."
"Senator Warner","I had a family member who I warned time and again do not get into this adjustable rate mortgage. All the warnings in the world, all the transparency in the world, would not have precluded her from taking a bad long-term action. I was able to bail her out, but now we are looking to a national Uncle Sam bailing everybody out because at some point people with information may still not be making good financial judgments here."
"Mr. Dodaro","I agree completely."
"Senator Warner","So there has to be some protection component."
"Mr. Dodaro","Right."
"Senator Warner","I know our time is getting short, but one last question. We have spent a lot of time, again, about all these new financial tools and the over-financial engineering that is taking place. How do we make sure that the regulators stay abreast of these tools and have the skills and the technology and the competency to make sure that they actually understand these new products as they emerge?"
"Mr. Dodaro","Well, I clearly think--and I will ask Ms. Williams to comment on this because she has been doing a lot of our work on these instruments. But, first, clearly the goal has to be set for them to do that. And I think if the Congress sets a statutory--as part of the regulatory goal, an expectation that occur, that is there, I think they need to be given then the authorities to be able to hire the necessary people and compensate them appropriately for doing that. And I do think they would have the capability to be able to do it. There is no doubt in my mind that you have some very talented people in the regulatory system right now that, given the proper goals and expectations, can, you know, develop in that area. It will not be easy because of the ingenuity of many of the market participants, but I think it is achievable. Orice, do you have anything?"
"Ms. Williams","The only thing that I would add is that this is an area that the regulators are always going to be at a disadvantage in dealing with because the markets are always looking to come up with new and innovative products. But I think one of the things that would really help--and we tried to speak to this with our principal, focused on having, you know, a flexible, nimble process for regulators to be able to adjust, is to get beyond the type of product and the label that is attached to a particular product and really be able to focus on the risk that that product may pose to the system and making that the focus and the driver for whether or not products need to be brought under a regulatory umbrella."
"Senator Warner","So actually making a risk assessment of the product, and then if the assessment was the product was too risky, then perhaps saying some universes of consumers might not be eligible to----"
"Ms. Williams","Or that it needs to be, you know, regulated or looked at from a regulatory perspective and not just focus specifically on it meets this statutory definition so, therefore, it falls out of a regulatory jurisdiction versus it poses this particular risk to the system, therefore, it needs to be subject to some level of regulation and oversight."
"Senator Warner","We had that situation last week in the Madoff hearing where we had both SEC and FINRA here, and, you know, asked very much suddenly, you know, on broker-dealers, if somebody says they were an investment adviser and FINRA is looking, they are going to suddenly stop and not turn over that information. These regulatory lines clearly in that case might have precluded exposing a real financial scam."
"Ms. Williams","Exactly. And one example, we have worked looking at credit default swaps, and that is another example of a product that meets a definition and, therefore, there is----"
"Senator Warner","No examination beyond meeting the definition."
"Ms. Williams","Exactly."
"Senator Warner","Amen. Thank you very much."
"Ms. Williams","You are welcome."
"Senator Akaka"," Thank you very much, Senator Warner. Mr. Dodaro, it is good to see you again, and our panel. I am so glad that we have a new team that is addressing the problems that we are facing immediately. And I think you know the history of the so-called Financial Literacy and Education Commission. That is chaired by the Secretary of Treasury, and it has a mission that has really not been carried out. And I think that is an answer to some of the problems that have been mentioned here. Previously, I heard about protecting the consumers. Well before the current economic crisis that we are facing at this time, financial regulatory systems were failing--failing to adequately protect working families from predatory practices and exploitation. And this Commission was really put in place to try to prepare strategies that would deal with the problems that people in the country would have. I would tell you that one of the huge problems that this country has is that this country is financially illiterate. And so these financial literacy programs fill that void, and we need to really, I feel, try to bring that back to life and to help the causes here. Families have been pushed into mortgage products with associated risks and costs that they could not afford. And instead of utilizing affordable, low-cost financial services found at regulated banks and credit unions, too many working families have been exploited by the high cost of fringe financial service providers such as payday lenders and check cashers. I would tell you--and I am sure it is not only in Hawaii--that you find offices like these outside of our bases, and so our military personnel really suffer on this. So my question to you, Mr. Dodaro, is: How do we create a regulatory structure that better protects working families against predatory practices?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I will ask Rick to elaborate on the Financial Literacy Commission, Senator Akaka, but first, it is a pleasure to see you again as well. We have studied the Financial Literacy Commission. We have also studied issues relating to information being provided to our military families to educate them. Ms. Williams was involved in that, and we can provide that information for the record as well. But I think, clearly, the issue first has to be a clear articulation of consumer protection being a clear goal of the regulatory system, to have it organized properly, resourced properly, and there needs to be continual congressional oversight. I think this is an area that the whole financial regulatory system needs to have some ongoing oversight activities. Even if the Congress makes the determination that the system is going to be modernized and a new system is put in place, the idea that that would operate effectively from day one without continual refinement and oversight I think is an unrealistic goal. And so I would say there needs to be a proper transition and it needs to be followed through on oversight. But let me have Rick talk about the Financial Literacy Commission, because I could not agree with you more about its importance."
"Senator Akaka","Thank you."
"Mr. Hillman","We recently completed a report assessing the Financial Literacy Commission at the Department of Treasury. Exactly as you have said, this Commission was established to help to promote financial literacy on a nationwide level. It brought together over 20 departments and agencies who had financial literacy programs with the hope of consolidating those efforts and distributing those out to the nations in need. What we have found, however, though, is that the Commission itself is well understaffed and unable to achieve the mission which it was set up to accomplish. For example, one of the activities that the Commission undertook was to ask each of these agencies to determine the extent to which they had any overlap or duplication in the individual financial literacy initiatives that they had undertaken. And due to a lack of resources, they asked each of the agencies to themselves make that assessment as opposed to having some sort of expert assessment done by an outside party. That internal assessment came up with very limited suggestions as to how the financial literacy programs could be improved, and we made a recommendation that they seek additional expertise to assess the effectiveness of those programs. Regarding the notion on the military bases, we have done significant work and we have work ongoing now that is looking at the extent to which sales of financial products to the military, particularly egregious insurance products, are continuing to cause havoc on bases. Sadly, we are finding that that continues to be the case. One of the major limitations associated with the oversight of payday lenders and other types of establishments that you mentioned in your State that is rampant across all States has to do with the fact that those types of associations that fall outside of the reach of a financial services regulator are under the regulatory authority of the Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission is largely an enforcement agency, not an oversight agency. It is a small organization with significant responsibilities, and currently configured, it is simply unable to achieve the level of oversight that most would like to have."
"Senator Akaka","Yes, and I also understand that the Commission, as you said, has been understaffed. Also, they are having problems trying to come to some consensus among themselves, the 20 Federal agencies, and simply because they have different missions and perspectives. But I hope that we can look at these missions and perspectives as a means of bringing a solution to this particular problem. And part of the mission, of course, is education, and this is one thing that we really need to press across the country. And I feel that if more of the citizens of this country were better educated financially, some of the problems we are facing now may not have been as large as this. But I think we need to, Mr. Dodaro, work on this Commission to make it more effective and to use its efforts to deal with financial literacy in the country."
"Mr. Dodaro","I agree, Mr. Chairman, and we would be happy to follow up on our report and provide a follow-up activity report on how well they have implemented the recommendations to the Committee."
"Senator Akaka","Well, let me thank you for your January 2009 report, and I have seen parts of it, and your report states that:  New and more complex products raise challenges for regulators in addressing financial literacy. Without sufficient financial literacy, individuals will not be able to effectively evaluate credit and investing opportunities or be able to cope with difficult economic situations.  And we agree with that. My question to you is: How can we ensure that in a new regulatory structure financial literacy is effectively addressed?"
"Mr. Dodaro","I think in the characteristics that we point out in our January report, Senator, we point out a couple things, characteristics that are pivotal to this issue. One is clear articulation in statute of a regulatory goal. So this needs to be clearly articulated. Someone has to be given the responsibility for doing it, proper resources, proper accountability back to the Congress, and I think that there needs to just be follow-up. This is not a hugely difficult task in the sense if we make a priority and then we apply the proper resources and we ensure people are following through on this initiative. Plus I think this is one that if there is work to be done with our education system, there needs to be an integrated fashion, you know, put in place to be able to do this. One of the things that I almost did rather than come to GAO many, many years ago is I had an idea to start a class to be taught in high schools on this very issue at that point in time because I think it is very important. It has got to start early with people and be built into the education system, and then it has to be reinforced on a more sophisticated level as people take on additional responsibilities and begin working and making larger purchases going forward."
"Senator Akaka","Well, I want to thank our witnesses today for appearing here, and I apologize for Chairman Dodd, who was called away. That is why he is not here. And I want to thank you again for your responses. The hearing record will remain open for additional statements and questions, and, again, I thank you for your responses and look forward to having you in hearings in the future. This hearing is adjourned.  "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES SCHUMER"," First, I'd like to thank Chairman Dodd for holding the first of what I'm sure will be many hearings on financial regulatory reform. For decades, America generally, and New York in particular, have been the financial capitals of the world. Our markets have been the deepest, most liquid and safest. Our dominant position was built not only on our talent, ingenuity and expertise, but also on a foundation of strong but efficient regulation, and a reputation for fairness, that demonstrated to investors that they would be protected from fraud and financial recklessness here. The events of past 24 months have destroyed our reputation as the system has been gripped by a financial crisis that resulted from years of regulatory neglect at all levels. Eight years of the Bush Administration's one-sided, laissez-faire, deregulatory ideology have helped cripple our financial system, and an outdated and overmatched regulatory system in this country compounded their failure. Even former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, once an ardent defender of deregulation and the free market, recently acknowledged that there was a ``flaw'' in his belief that markets could and would regulate themselves. I hope that we've learned that as appealing as deregulation may seem in good times, the price we ultimately pay will be far higher than had we exercised the good judgment and restraint imposed by responsible regulation. Designing a regulatory system is a complicated and difficult task. Regulation must strike a delicate balance--providing a sense of safety and security for investors, without snuffing out the flame of entrepreneurial vigor and financial innovation that drives economic growth. It's easy, and even tempting, to go to the ideological extremes on either end of the spectrum. But threading this needle correctly is an essential component of restoring confidence and long-term stability to the financial system. For many years, the United States had struck that balance very well. However, new factors, including technology, globalization, and industry consolidation and evolution have left our regulatory infrastructure too far behind the reality of today's global financial system. Where does this leave us? Well, it leaves us needing significant reform. As we go forward, I believe there are a number of clear principles that we must adhere to. I've discussed these principles before, but I think they're worth repeating now as we begin the discussion of regulatory reform under a new Administration.  1.)  We must focus on controlling systemic risk and ensuring stability.  In increasingly complex markets, even the most sophisticated financial institutions don't always understand the risks their decisions involve. Smaller institutions like some hedge funds and private equity firms, can also create systemic risk in today's world and cannot escape regulation, particularly when it comes to transparency. We need regulation that looks at risk systemically and above all, we need to ensure that whatever may happen to any individual financial actor, we can be confident that the financial system itself will remain strong and stable.  2.)  We need to look closely at unifying and simplifying our regulatory structure.  In this era of global markets and global actors, we cannot maintain the older model of separate businesses with separate regulators. Right now there are too many regulators at the Federal level with overlapping authority. This creates a regulatory ``race to the bottom'' as less responsible firms are able to play the regulators off one another in their efforts to operate with as little oversight and as few restrictions as possible.  3.)  It is clear that we must figure out how to regulate currently unregulated parts of the financial markets and opaque and complex financial instruments.  There are too many vital players and products in the financial markets that operate beyond the scope of Federal regulators, yet have the ability to put the system at risk. We must create an effective regulatory framework for those actors and for more exotic financial instruments like complex derivatives and even the relatively plain vanilla credit-default swaps, which have grown into a multi-trillion dollar part of the financial system.  4.)  We must recognize that a global financial world requires global solutions.  In this era of global finance, while we have international markets, we still have national regulations. The danger is that there is often a rush to the place where regulation is lightest and least effective. This may be our toughest challenge.  5.)  Increased transparency must be a central goal.  We must continue to emphasize transparency among all market participants. The ability of investors, lenders and especially regulators to evaluate the quality of holdings and borrowings is essential for restoring confidence. A complete overhaul of this nation's financial regulatory system will be difficult, complex and time consuming. I look forward to working with President Obama, and under the leadership of Chairman Dodd to advance this process so that as we begin to recover from the current financial crisis in the coming months, we have a system in place to prevent its repetition.

"PREPARED STATEMENT OF PAUL A. VOLCKER"," Chairman, Steering Committee of the Group of 30 February 4, 2009 Mr. Chairman and Members of the Senate Banking Committee: I appreciate your invitation to discuss the recent Report on Financial Reform issued by the ``Group of 30''. I remind you that the Group is international, bringing together members with broad financial experience from both the private and public sectors and drawn from both highly developed and emerging economies. While certainly relevant to the United States, most of the recommendations are generally applicable among globally active financial markets. I understand that the text of the Report has been distributed to you and your staff and will be included in the Committee record. Accordingly, my statement will be short. What is evident is that we meet at a time of acute distress in financial markets with strongly adverse effects on the economy more broadly. There is a clear need for early and effective governmental programs both to support economic activity and to ease the flow of credit. It is also evident that fundamental changes and reform of the financial system will be required to assure that strong, competitive and innovative private financial markets can in the future again support economic growth without risk of a systemic financial breakdown. It is that latter challenge to which the G-30 Report is addressed. I understand that President Obama and his administration will soon place before you a specific program for dealing with the banking crisis. Such emergency measures are not the subject of our Report. However, I do believe that the implementation of the more immediate measures will be facilitated by an agreed sense of the essential elements of a reformed financial system. In that respect, the basic thrust of the G-30 Report is to distinguish among the basic functions of any financial system. First, there is a need for strong and stable institutions serving the needs of individuals, businesses, governments, and others for a safe and sound repository of funds, as a reliable source of credit, and for a robust financial infrastructure able to withstand and diffuse shocks and volatility. I think of this as the service-oriented part of the financial system dealing with customer relationships. It is characterized mainly by commercial banks that have long been supported and protected by deposit insurance, access to Federal Reserve credit, and other elements of the Federal safety net. What has become apparent during this period of crisis is increasing concentration in banking and the importance of official support for systemically important institutions at risk of failure. What is apparent is that a sudden breakdown or discontinuity in the functioning of such institutions risks widespread repercussions on markets, on closely interconnected financial institutions, and on the broader economy. The design of any financial system raises large questions about the appropriate criteria for, and the ways and means of, providing official support for these systemically important institutions. In common ground with virtually all official and private analysts, the Report calls for ``particularly close regulation and supervision, meeting high and common international standards'' for institutions deemed systemically critical. It also explicitly calls for restrictions on ``proprietary activities that present particularly high risks and serious conflicts of interest'' deemed inconsistent with the primary responsibilities of those institutions. Of relevance in the light of recent efforts of some commercial enterprises to recast financial affiliates as bank holding companies, the Report strongly urges continuing past U.S. practice of prohibiting ownership or control of Government-insured, deposit-taking institutions by non-financial firms. Secondly, the Report implicitly assumes that, while regulated banking institutions will be dominant providers of financial services, a variety of capital market institutions will remain active. Organized markets and private pools of capital will be engaging in trading, transformation of credit instruments, and developing derivatives and hedging strategies, and other innovative activities, potentially adding to market efficiency and flexibility. These institutions do not directly serve the general public and individually are less likely to be of systemic significance. Nonetheless, experience strongly points to the need for greater transparency. Specifically beyond some minimum size, registration of hedge and equity funds, should be required, and if substantial use of borrowed funds takes place, an appropriate regulator should be able to require periodic reporting and appropriate disclosure. Furthermore, in those exceptional cases when size, leverage, or other characteristics pose potential systemic concerns, the regulator should be able to establish appropriate standards for capital, liquidity and risk management. The Report does not deal with important and sensitive questions of the appropriate administrative arrangements for the regulatory and supervisory functions. These are in any case likely to be influenced by particular national traditions and concerns. What is emphasized is that the quality and effectiveness of prudential regulation and supervision must be improved. Insulation from political and private special interests is a key, along with adequate and highly competent staffing. That implies adequate funding. The precise role and extent of the central bank with respect to regulation and supervision is not defined, and is likely to vary country by country. There is, however, a strong consensus that central banks should accept a continuing role in promoting and maintaining financial stability, not just in times of crisis, but in anticipating and dealing with points of vulnerability and risk. The Report deals with many more specific issues cutting across all institutions and financial markets. These include institutional and regulatory standards for governance and risk management, an appropriate accounting framework (including common international standards), reform of credit rating agencies, and appropriate disclosure and transparency standards for derivatives and securitized credits. Specifically, the Report calls for ending the hybrid private/public nature of the two very large Government-sponsored mortgage enterprises in the United States. Under the pressure of financial crisis, they have not been able to serve either their public purposes or private stockholders successfully. To the extent the Government wishes to provide support for the residential mortgage market, it should do so by means of clearly designated Government agencies. Finally, I want to emphasize that success in the reform effort, in the context of global markets and global institutions, will require consistency in approach among countries participating significantly in international markets. There are established fora for working toward such coordination. I trust the forthcoming G-20 meeting, bringing together leaders of so many relevant nations, can provide impetus for thoughtful and lasting reform.  "

"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JOHNSON FROM PAUL A. VOLCKER","  Q.1. There is pressure to move quickly and reform our financial regulatory structure. What areas should we address in the near future and which areas should we set aside until we realize the full cost of the economic fallout we are currently experiencing?  A.1. I recognize the desire to move quickly to reform the financial regulators structure, but more important is to get it right. Speed should not become the enemy of the good, and a piece-meal approach may inadvertently prejudice the thoroughgoing comprehensive measures we need. There may be a few measures--such as the proposed new crisis resolution procedure--that may be usefully enacted promptly, but we still have much to learn from unfolding experience and about the need to achieve international consistency.  Q.2. The largest individual corporate bailout to date has not been a commercial bank, but an insurance company. Given the critical role of insurers in enabling credit transactions and insuring against every kind of potential loss, and the size and complexity of many insurance companies, do you believe that we can undertake serious market reform without establishing Federal regulation of the insurance industry?  A.2. Consideration of Federal regulation of insurance companies and their holding companies is an example of the need for a comprehensive approach. A feasible starting point should be the availability of a Federal charter, at least for large institutions operating inter-state and internationally, with the implication of Federal supervision.  Q.3. As Chairman of the G-30, can you go into greater detail about the report's recommended reestablishment of a framework for supervision over large international insurers? Particularly, cm you provide some further details or thoughts on how this recommendation could be developed here in the United States? Can you comment on the advantages of creating a Federal insurance regulator in the United States?  A.3. As indicated, the absence of a Federal charter and supervision for insurance companies is a gap in our current regulatory framework. I am not prepared now to opine whether the Federal regulator should be separate from other supervisory agencies but some means of encouraging alignment is necessary. Again, I'd prefer to see the issue resolved in the context of a more comprehensive approach; in this case including consideration of appropriate and feasible international standards.  Q.4. How should the Government and regulators look to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large interconnected financial companies? Do we risk distorting the market by identifying certain institutions as systemically important? How do foreign countries identify and regulate systemically critical institutions?  A.4. The question of mitigating systemic risks is a key issue in financial reform, and can be approached in different ways. Specifically identifying particular institutions as systemically important, with the implication of special supervisory attention and support, has important adverse implications in terms of competitive balance and moral hazard. I am not aware of any foreign country that explicitly identifies and regulates particular systemically critical institutions, but in practice sizable banking institutions have been protected. An alternative approach toward systemic risk would be to provide a designated regulatory agency with authority to oversee banks and other institutions, with a mandate to identify financial practices (e.g., weak credit practices, speculative trading excesses, emerging ``bubbles'', capital weaknesses) that create systemic risk and need regulatory supervision. Particular institutions need not be identified for special attention.  Q.5. In your testimony you say that you support continuing past U.S. practice of prohibiting ownership or control of Government-insured, deposit-taking institutions by non- financial firms. What are your thoughts on the commercial industrial loan company (ILC) charter? Should this continue to exist?  A.5. I do believe recent experience only reinforces long- standing American aversion to mixtures of banking and commerce. The commercial industrial loan companies and other devices to blur the distinction should be guarded against, severely limited if not prohibited.   "
"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR JOHNSON FROM GENE L. DODARO","  Q.1. There is pressure to move quickly and reform our financial regulatory structure. What areas should we address in the near future and which areas should we set aside until we realize the full cost of the economic fallout we are currently experiencing?  A.1. As we noted in our January 2009 report, financial regulators have been appropriately focused on limiting the damage from the current crisis to the United States economy and its financial system.\1\ Given the experiences of other countries, particularly Japan that suffered stagnation for a decade likely as a result of its ineffective attempts to address its financial crisis in the 1990s, Congress and regulators should likely continue to address in the near term efforts to further stem the crisis and restore our financial institutions to more normal operating conditions, including finding an appropriate and effective solution to the issue of troubled assets being held by so many institutions.  \1\  GAO, Financial Regulation: A Framework for Crafting and Assessing Proposals to Modernize the Outdated U.S. Financial Regulatory System, GAO-09-216 (Washington, D.C.: Jan. 8, 2009.)  However, directing actions more to the current crisis should not preclude Congress from exploring with regulators plans for modernizing the United States financial regulatory system. As we pointed out, taking piecemeal actions and creating new regulations and regulatory bodies in the aftermath of past financial turmoil is one reason why our current structure is so fragmented and has the gaps and inconsistencies in oversight that have contributed to the current crisis. As a result, careful consideration of how best to develop a structure and financial regulatory bodies within it that more holistically embodies aspects like the nine elements of an effective regulatory system that we described in our report is important. Taking adequate time to consider and complete this critical task is more advisable than taking quick actions that could lead to gaps or inconsistencies later.  Q.2. The largest individual corporate bailout to date has not been a commercial bank, but an insurance company. Given the critical role of insurers in enabling credit transactions and insuring against every kind of potential loss, and the size and complexity of many insurance companies, do you believe that we can undertake serious market reform without establishing Federal regulation of the insurance industry?  A.2. Over the years, GAO has reported on the inconsistency and lack of uniformity of regulation that insurance companies receive across states. This lack of consistency can lead to uneven protections for consumers across states as well as inefficiencies for insurers that could lead to higher premiums. We currently have a study under way looking at reciprocity and uniformity of State insurance regulation in three key areas: product approval, producer licensing, and market conduct regulation. The study will touch on issues of consistent oversight across states. Having an optional Federal charter for insurance would be one way to potentially increase the consistency of oversight of insurance companies. Although the problems experienced by AIG and the subsequent action by the Government to address them demonstrates that the United States has significant gaps in its oversight of significant financial institutions, the extent to which this case demonstrates the need for Federal insurance oversight is unclear. Although some of AIG's financial difficulties arose from the securities lending activities engaged in by its life insurance companies, and some of the Federal assistance went toward unwinding those transactions, the insurance company operations were, and have remained, stable. Those companies have been negatively affected by the damage to the parent company's reputation, and may no longer benefit to the same extent from the parent company's financial strength, but they appear to be financially sound. While it's possible closer review by State insurance regulators may have more quickly identified the risk associated with the life insurance companies' securities lending operations, the primary problems appear to have originated in one of AIG's non-insurance subsidiaries. In addition, State insurance laws require State insurance regulators to approve any significant transactions between an insurance company and its parent company or other subsidiaries, and, according to State regulatory officials and AIG securities filings, some State regulators did not allow transactions that would have transferred capital from AIG's insurance companies to the parent company.  Q.3. The GAO recommends consistent financial oversight--to ensure that similar institutions, products, risk and services are subject to consistent regulation oversight and transparency. In the case of insurance, the regulation and oversight is not consistent. Shouldn't insurance receive the same consistent financial oversight that is desperately needed for other financial institutions?  A.3. In our January 2009 report on the need for regulatory reform, we noted that the United States needs a financial regulatory system that is appropriately comprehensive and provides consistent oversight of institutions engaging in similar activities and risks. In addition, we advocated that consumer protections be similarly consistent across institutions and products. As a result, to the extent that insurance companies conduct activities, such as over-the- counter derivatives trading or market products as investment alternatives to securities or bank saving products, we advocated that they be overseen with similar risk management, capital, and consumer disclosure requirements. In general, the operations of most insurance companies themselves do not appear to have given rise to the complexities that made regulation difficult in the case of AIG. For entities that just engage in insurance activities, having Federal oversight could be one way that more uniformity of oversight is achieved. However, our report also noted that State regulators, including those for insurance, have played important roles in identifying and taking actions to address problems for consumers. As noted above, we have a study under way looking at reciprocity and uniformity of State insurance regulation that will touch on issues of consistent oversight across States.  Q.4. The GAO's report suggests that Congress should consider establishing a Federal insurance regulator; can you comment on the advantages of creating a Federal insurance regulator in the United States?  A.4. As we noted above, a Federal insurance charter could have the potential to alleviate some of the challenges in harmonizing insurance regulation across States. However, we also note that such an approach could have various disadvantages. Currently, property and casualty insurance activities are heavily influenced by State laws--including those relating to insurance, torts, and business operations-- and having Federal oversight of such varying requirements could be very challenging. In addition, State regulators assert that because of their greater familiarity with the particular demographics of their jurisdictions, they are in a better position to protect consumers. Another issue that would have to be addressed in implementing a Federal insurance charter would be the loss of income to states from taxes paid on insurance premiums by consumers. These taxes generally provide funds beyond what is required to fund the regulation of insurance.  Q.5. How should the Government and regulators look to mitigate the systemic risks posed by large interconnected financial companies? Do we risk distorting the market by identifying certain institutions as systemically important? How do foreign countries identify and regulate systemically critical institutions?  A.5. Various options exist for addressing the systemic risk posed by large interconnected financial institutions. As we advocated in our January 2009 report, such institutions should receive comprehensive and consistent regulation from both a prudential and consumer protection standpoints.\2\ Having such oversight should reduce the potential for such institutions to experience problems that threaten the stability and soundness of other institutions and the overall financial system itself. In addition, we advocated that our regulatory system needs a systemwide focus to address the potential threats to system stability that can arise from institutions, products, and markets. Such a focus could be achieved by designating an existing regulator or creating a new entity to be tasked with overseeing systemic risk in the United States. Such an entity could also be tasked with prudential oversight of the large interconnected financial institutions or their primary oversight could remain the responsibility of another regulator with the systemic risk regulator supplementing this oversight by collecting information, examining operations, and directing changes from the large institutions as needed. "
"\2\ GAO-09-216.","  While one obvious way of ensuring that these large institutions are all subject to similar regulatory requirements and oversight would be to designate them as systemically important and place them under the regulation of a single regulatory body, such an approach also has disadvantages. Some market observers have expressed concerns that designating certain institutions as systemically important could distort competition in the financial market sectors in which these entities operate by providing the designated institutions with funding advantages and reducing market discipline of the firms that do business with them because of the belief that the Government will not allow such institutions to fail. In light of the experience of the housing Government-sponsored enterprises recently, such concerns should be taken seriously. However, the more extensive oversight that systemically important financial institutions would likely receive could offset some of the competitive advantage they receive from being designated as so. Given such institutions greater potential than other institutions to create systemic problems, they should appropriately be subject to higher prudential standards for capital, liquidity, and counter-party risk management, etc. So although their status as systemically important institutions could possibly create competitive distortions or moral hazard, increased prudential standards would seek to mitigate that (and any systemic risks they might pose). Other countries have not generally had to face the issue of whether their systemically important institutions should be supervised separately because of the differences in the regulatory and market structures outside the United States. In many countries, the primary financial institutions are universal banks that offer a range of services across sectors, including banking, securities, and insurance activities, and that are overseen by a single regulatory body, which reduces the potential for inconsistent oversight. In addition, the number of financial institutions in many countries is relatively small, which also reduces the potential for less consistent oversight across institutions that might provide a competitive advantage for those designated as systemically important.
