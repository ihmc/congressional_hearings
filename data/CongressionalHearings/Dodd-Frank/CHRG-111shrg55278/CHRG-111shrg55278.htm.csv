Speaker,Speech,Type,Comments
"Chairman Dodd","I will make some opening comments, turn to Senator Shelby for his, and then we will invite our very distinguished witnesses to join us at the witness table, and I will in advance apologize to them if we interrupt your testimony once the 12th Member arrives here, to go back into executive calendar to deal with this legislation. So let us shift gears, if we can now, to the hearing, and that is, as I mentioned earlier, a hearing to establish a framework for systemic risk regulation. Let me just share some thoughts, if I can. And, again, we have had a lot of discussion about this subject matter over the last number of months. We have had some 40 hearings in this Committee since January, not all of it on this subject matter, but the bulk of the hearings have been on this whole issue of how do we modernize our financial regulatory structure not only to address the problems that have brought us to this point, but also how do we create that architecture for the 21st century that will allow us to move forward with innovation and creativity that has been the hallmark of our financial services sector, and yet once again restore that credibility of safety and soundness that has been the hallmark, I think, of our financial services sector for so many years, and yet collapsed, in the views of many, over the last number of years, resulting in the economic problems that so many of our fellow citizens are facing, with joblessness, with house foreclosures, retirement accounts being wiped out, and all of the ancillary problems that our economy is suffering through. Systemic risk is going to be an important factor in all of this, and I cannot begin to express my gratitude to my fellow Members here because, unlike other matters that the Congress is dealing with, my sense is on this subject matter this is not one that has any ideology, that I can sense, to it at all. What all of us want is to figure out what works best, what makes sense for us here--not that we are going to solve every future problem. I think we make a mistake if we are sort of promising what we cannot deliver on. There will be future problems, and we are not going to solve every one of them. But if we look back a bit and see where the gaps have been, either, one, where there was no authority or, two, where there was authority but it was not being exercised, then how we fill those gaps in a way that makes sense I think will be a major contribution. And I want to particularly thank Senator Shelby, the former Chairman of this Committee, the Ranking Member now. We have had a lot of conversations together. We do not have a bill ready at all. There has been a lot of talk at this point. But I get a sense among my colleagues, as I have discussed the subject matter with them, that we share a lot of common views about this, and that is a good place to begin. It does not mean we are going to agree on every answer we have, but I sense that the overwhelming majority of us here are committed to that goal of establishing what makes sound and solid regulatory process. The economic crisis introduced a new term in our national vocabulary: ``systemic risk.'' Not words we use much. I do not recall using those words at all back over the years. It is the idea that in an interconnected global economy, it is easy for some people's problems to become everybody's problems, and that is what systemic risk is. The failures that destroyed some of our Nation's most prestigious financial institutions also devastated the economic security of millions of working Americans who did nothing wrong and never heard of these institutions that collapsed and put them at great risk. Jobs, homes, and retirement security were gone in a flash because Wall Street greed in some cases, regulatory neglect in others, resulted in these problems. After years of focusing on short-term profits while ignoring long-term risk, a number of companies, giants of the financial industry, found themselves in very serious trouble. Some, as we know, tragically, failed. Some were sold under duress. And an untold number only survived because of Government intervention--loans, guarantees, direct injections of capital. Taxpayers had no choice but to step in--and that is my strong view--assuming billions of risk and saved companies because our system was not set up to withstand their failure. Their efforts saved our economy from catastrophe, but real damage remains, as we all are painfully aware. Investors who lost billions were scared to invest. Credit markets dried up, with no one willing to make loans. Businesses could not make payrolls. Employees were laid off and families could not get mortgages or loans to buy an automobile, even. Wall Street's failures have hit Main Street, as we all know, across our Nation, and it will take years, perhaps decades, to undo the damage that a stronger regulatory system I think could have prevented. And while many Americans understand why we had to take extraordinary measures this time, it does not mean that they are not angry, because they are. It does not mean they are not worried, and they certainly are that. And it does not mean they do not expect us to fix the problems that allowed this to happen. First and foremost, we need someone looking at the whole economy for the next big problem with the authority to do something about it. The Administration has a bold proposal to modernize our financial regulatory system. It would give the Federal Reserve new authority to identify, regulate, and supervise all financial companies considered to be systemically important. It would establish a council of regulators to serve in a sole advisory role. And it would provide a framework for companies to fail, if they must fail, in a way that does not jeopardize the entire financial system. It is a thoughtful proposal, but the devil, obviously, we all know, is in the details, and I expect changes to be made in this proposal. I share my colleagues' concerns about giving the Fed additional authority to regulate systemic risk. The Fed has not done a perfect job, to put it mildly, with the responsibilities it already has. This new authority could compromise the independence the Fed needs to carry out effective monetary policy. Additionally, systemic risk regulation involves too broad of a range of issues, in my view, for any one regulator to be able to oversee. And so I am especially interested to hear from our witnesses this morning on your ideas and how we might get this right. Many of you have suggested a council with real authority that would effectively use the combined knowledge of all of the regulatory agencies. As President Obama has said, when we rebuild our economy, we must ensure that its foundation rests on a rock, not on sand. And today we continue our work to lay the cornerstones of that foundation--strong, smart, effective regulation that protects working families without hindering growth, innovation, and creativity that has been, again, the hallmark, as I said earlier, of our financial services sector. With that, let me turn to Senator Shelby, and then I will introduce our first panel.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. At the core of the Administration's financial regulatory reform proposal is the concept of systemic risk. The President believes that it can be regulated and that the Fed should be the regulator. But as we begin to consider how to address systemic risk, my main concern is that while there appears to be a growing consensus on the need for a systemic risk regulator, there is no agreement on how to define systemic risk, let alone how to manage it. I believe that it would be legislative malfeasance to simply tell a particular regulator to manage all financial risk without having reached some consensus on what systemic risk is and whether it can be regulated at all. Should we reach such a consensus, I believe we then must be very careful not to give our markets a false sense of security that could actually exacerbate our ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. If market participants believe that they no longer have to closely monitor risk presented by financial institutions, the stage will be set for our next economic crisis. If we can decide what systemic risk is and that it is something that should and can be regulated, I believe our next question should be: Who should regulate it? Unfortunately, I believe the Administration's proposal largely places the Federal Reserve in charge of regulating systemic risk. It would grant the Fed, as I understand the white paper, authority to regulate any bank, securities firm, insurer, investment fund, or any other type of financial institution that the Fed deems a systemic risk. The Fed would be able to regulate any aspect of these firms, even over the objections of other regulators. In effect, the Fed would become a regulator giant of unprecedented size and scope. I believe that expanding the Fed's power in this manner could be very dangerous. The mixing of monetary policy and bank regulation has proven to be a formula for taxpayer-funded bailouts and poor monetary policy decisions. Giving the Fed ultimate responsibility for the regulation of systemically important firms will provide further incentives for the Fed to hide its regulatory failures by bailing out troubled firms. Rather than undertaking the politically painful task of resolving failed institutions, the Fed could take the easy way out and rescue them by using its lender-of-last-resort facilities or open market operations. Even worse, it could undertake these bailouts without having to obtain the approval of the Congress. In our system of Government, elected officials should make decisions about fiscal policy and the use of taxpayers' dollars, not unelected central bankers. Handing over the public purse to an enhanced Fed is simply inconsistent with the principles of democratic Government. Augmenting the Federal Reserve's authority also risks burdening it with more responsibility than one institution can reasonably be expected to handle. In fact, the Federal Reserve is already overburdened with its responsibility for monetary policy, the payment system, consumer protection, and bank supervision. I believe anointing the Fed as the systemic risk regulator will make what has proven to be a bad bank regulator even worse. Let us not forget that it was the Fed that pushed for the adoption of the flawed Basel II Capital Accords right here in this Committee which would have drained our banking system of capital. It was the Fed that failed to adequately supervise Citigroup and Bank of America, setting the stage for bailouts in excess of $400 billion there. It was the Fed that failed to adopt mortgage underwriting guidelines until well after this crisis was underway. Yes, it was the Fed that said there was no need to regulate derivatives right here in this Committee. It was also the Fed that lobbied to become the regulator of financial holding companies as part of Gramm-Leach-Bliley. The Fed won that fight and got the additional authority it sought. Ten years later, however, it is clear that the Fed has proven that it is incapable of handling that responsibility. Ultimately, I believe if we are able to reach some sort of agreement on systemic risk and whether it can be managed, I strongly believe that we should consider every possible alternative to the Fed as a systemic risk regulator. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator, and we are still missing one, I think. Is it one? One. We need 12. If I have a colleague that can count 12, I am willing to move ahead on that.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","After all, this is Washington, you know. We will wait for the 12th to arrive. Let me invite Sheila Bair and Mary Schapiro and Dan Tarullo to join us at the witness table, and let me briefly introduce the people who hardly need an introduction. They have been before this Committee on numerous occasions, and we thank them. Sheila Bair, as we all know, is our Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, served as Assistant Secretary at the Treasury, has an extensive background in banking finance, and, of course, many of us up here have known her over the years when she was legal counsel to Bob Dole and did a great job in that capacity as well, so very familiar with the Senate as an institution. Mary Schapiro is the new Chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and prior to her appointment this year, she served as the CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, also served as a Commissioner of the SEC during Ronald Reagan's administration, President Bush 41, and the Clinton administration. Dan Tarullo--I will finish this and then turn to our executive session--is the new member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and, again, a familiar figure to many of us up here, having served in public life on numerous occasions in the past, including Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs, before he served as Chief Counsel for Employment Policy on the staff of our good friend Senator Ted Kennedy as well, and taught at Georgetown University Law Center, worked in the Clinton administration. So we thank you, Dan for your service, as we do yours, Mary, and Sheila Bair.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","We will now go back to our witnesses. You have been introduced, and, Sheila, we will begin with you. All statements, supporting data, materials, and the like that you think would be valuable for our Committee as we consider modernization of the Federal regulatory structure, of course, will be included in the record. That is also true, of course, of all of our colleagues here as well. We would like you, if you could, to try to keep those remarks to 5 or 7 minutes so we can get to the questions as quickly as possible. Thank you for joining us.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate you holding this hearing. The issues under discussion today approach in importance those before the Congress in the wake of the Great Depression. We are emerging from a credit crisis that has wreaked havoc on our economy. Homes have been lost; jobs have been lost. Retirement and investment accounts have plummeted in value. The proposals put forth by the Administration to address the causes of this crisis are thoughtful and comprehensive. However, these are very complex issues that can be addressed in a number of different ways. It is clear that one of the causes of our current economic crisis is significant regulatory gaps within the financial system. Differences in the regulation of capital, leverage, complex financial instruments, and consumer protection provided an environment in which regulatory arbitrage became rampant. Reforms are urgently needed to close these regulatory gaps. At the same time, we must recognize that much of the risk in the system involved financial firms that were already subject to extensive regulation. One of the lessons of the past several years is that regulation alone is not sufficient to control risk taking within a dynamic and complex financial system. Robust and credible mechanisms to ensure that market participants will actively monitor and control risk taking must be in place. We must find ways to impose greater market discipline on systemically important institutions. In a properly functioning market economy, there will be winners and losers, and when firms--through their own mismanagement and excessive risk taking--are no longer viable, they should fail. Actions that prevent firms from failing ultimately distort market mechanisms, including the incentive to monitor the actions of similarly situated firms and allocate resources to the most efficient providers. Unfortunately, the actions taken during the past year have reinforced the idea that some financial organizations are too-big-to-fail. The notion of ``too-big-to-fail'' creates a vicious circle that needs to be broken. Large firms are able to raise huge amounts of debt and equity and are given access to the credit markets at favorable terms without sufficient consideration of the firms' risk profile. Investors and creditors believe their exposure is minimal since they also believe the Government will not allow these firms to fail. The large firms leverage these funds and become even larger, which makes investors and creditors more complacent and more likely to extend credit and funds without fear of losses. ``Too-big-to-fail'' must end. Today, shareholders and creditors of large financial firms rationally have every incentive to take excessive risk. They enjoy all the upside. But their downside is capped at their investment, and with ``too-big-to-fail,'' the Government even backstops that. For senior managers, the incentives are even more skewed. Paid in large part through stock options, senior managers have an even bigger economic stake in going for broke because their upside is so much bigger than any possible loss. And, once again, with ``too-big-to-fail'' the Government takes the downside. To end ``too-big-to-fail,'' we need a solution that uses a practical, effective, and highly credible mechanism for the orderly resolution of these institutions similar to that which exists for the FDIC-insured banks. When the FDIC closes a bank, shareholders and creditors take the first loss. When we call for a resolution mechanism, we are not talking about propping up the failed firm and its management. We are talking about a process where the failed bank is closed, where the shareholders and creditors typically suffer severe losses, and where management is replaced and the assets of the failed institution are sold off. This process is harsh, but it quickly reallocates assets back into the private sector and into the hands of better management. It also sends a strong message to the market that investors and creditors will face losses when an institution fails. So-called ``open bank assistance,'' which puts the interests of shareholders and creditors before that of the Government, should be prohibited. Make no mistake. I support the actions the regulators have collectively taken to stabilize the financial system. Lacking an effective resolution mechanism, we did what we had to do. But going forward, open bank assistance by any Government entity should be allowed only upon invoking the extraordinary systemic risk procedures, and even then, the standards should be tightened to prohibit assistance to prop up any individual firm. Moreover, whatever systemwide support is provided should be based on a specific finding that such support would be least costly to the Government as a whole. In addition, potentially systemic institutions should be subject to assessments that provide disincentives for complexity and high-risk behavior. I am very pleased that yesterday the President expressed support for the idea of an assessment. Funds raised through this assessment should be kept in reserve to provide working capital for the resolution of large financial organizations to further insulate taxpayers from loss. Without a new comprehensive resolution regime, we will be forced to repeat the costly ad hoc responses of the past year. In addition to a credible resolution process, there is a need to improve the structure for the supervision of systemically important institutions and create a framework that proactively identifies issues that pose risk to the financial system. The new structure, featuring a strong oversight council, should address such issues as the industry's excessive leverage, inadequate capital, and overreliance on short-term funding. A council of regulators will provide the necessary perspective and expertise to view our financial system holistically. A wide range of views makes it more likely we will capture the next problems before they happen. As with the FDIC Board, a systemic risk council can act quickly and efficiently in a crisis. The combination of the unequivocal prospect of an orderly closing, a stronger supervisory structure, and a council that anticipates and mitigates risks that are developing both within and outside the regulated financial sector will go a long way to assuring that the problems of the last several years are not repeated and that any problems that do arise can be handled without cost to the taxpayer. Thank you very much.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Chairman Bair.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you. Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am very pleased to be here today with my colleagues from the Fed and FDIC. There are many lessons to be learned from the recent financial crisis, and a key one is that we as regulators need to identify, monitor, and reduce systemic risk before they threaten the stability of the financial system. However, in our efforts to minimize the potential for institutional failures to threaten the system, we must take care not to unintentionally facilitate the growth of large, interconnected institutions whose failure might later pose even greater systemic risk. To best address these risks, I believe we must rely on two lines of defense. First, there is traditional oversight and regulation. This includes enhancing existing regulations, filling gaps, increasing transparency, and strengthening enforcement to prevent systemic risks from developing. And, second, we should establish a workable macroprudential regulatory framework and resolution regime that can identify, reduce, and unwind systemic risks if they do develop. Closing regulatory gaps is an important part of reducing systemic risk. If financial participants realize they can achieve the same economic ends with fewer costs by flocking to a regulatory gap, they will do so quickly, often with size and leverage. We have seen this time and again, most recently with over-the-counter derivatives, instruments through which major institutions engage in enormous, virtually unregulated trading in synthetic versions of other, often highly regulated financial products. We can do much to reduce systemic risk if we close these gaps and ensure that similar products are regulated similarly. In addition to filling gaps, we need to ensure greater transparency of risk. Transparency helps reduce systemic risk by enabling market participants to better allocate capital and giving regulators more information about risks that are building in the financial system. Transparency has been utterly lacking in the world of unregulated over-the-counter derivatives, hedge funds, and dark pools. Additionally, we need to recognize the importance that vigorous enforcement plays in sending a strong message to market participants. As a second line of defense, I believe there is a need to establish a framework for macroprudential oversight, a key element of the Administration's financial regulatory plan. Within that framework, I believe the most appropriate approach consists of a single systemic risk regulator and a very strong council. In terms of a systemic risk regulator, I agree there needs to be a governmental entity responsible for monitoring our financial markets for systemwide risks. This role could be performed by the Federal Reserve or by a new entity specifically designed for this task. The systemic risk regulator should have access to information across the financial markets about institutions that pose significant risk. And it should be able to monitor whether institutions are maintaining appropriate capital levels, and it should have clear delegated authority from the council to respond quickly in extraordinary circumstances. Most importantly, the systemic risk regulator should serve as a second set of eyes upon those institutions whose failure might put the system at risk. At the same time, I agree with the Administration that the systemic risk regulator must be combined with a newly created council, but I believe that any council must be strengthened well beyond the framework set forth in the Administration's white paper. The council should have authority to identify institutions, practices, and markets that create potential systemic risks and to set standards for liquidity, capital, and other risk management practices at systemically important institutions. This hybrid approach can help minimize systemic risk in a number of ways. First, a council would bring different perspectives to the identification of risks that individual regulators might miss or consider too small to warrant attention. Second, the members on the council would have experience regulating different types and sizes of institutions so that the council would be more likely to ensure that risk-based capital and leverage requirements do not unintentionally foster greater systemic risk. And, third, the council would include multiple agencies, thereby significantly reducing potential conflicts of interest and regulatory capture. Finally, the council would monitor the growth and development of financial institutions to prevent the creation of institutions that are either too-big-to-fail or too-big-to- succeed. At most times, I would expect the council and systemic risk regulator to work with and through primary regulators who are experts on the products and activities of their regulated entities. The systemic risk regulator, however, can provide a second layer of review over the activities, capital, and risk management procedures of systemically important institutions as a backstop to ensure that no red flags are missed. To ensure that authority is checked and decisions are not arbitrary, the council would remain the place where general policy is set, and if differences remain between the council and the primary regulator, the more stringent standards should apply. For example, on questions of capital, the new systemic risk framework should only be in a position to raise standards for regulatory capital for these institutions, not lower them. This will reduce the ability of any single regulator to compete with other regulators by lowering standards, driving a race to the bottom. And, finally, the Government needs a credible resolution mechanism for unwinding systemically important institutions. Currently, banks and broker-dealers are subject to resolution processes, but no corresponding resolution process exists for the holding companies of systemically significant financial institutions. I believe we have an opportunity to create a regulatory framework that will help prevent the type of systemic risk that created havoc in our financial system, and I believe we can create a credible regulatory regime that will help restore investor confidence. I look forward to working with you to address these issues and doing all we can to foster a safer, dynamic, and more nimble financial system. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MARY L. SCHAPIRO, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Chairwoman Schapiro. Dan Tarullo, welcome to the Committee once again.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee. My prepared statement sets forth in some detail the positions of the Federal Reserve on a number of the proposals that have been brought before you, so I thought I would use these introductory remarks to offer a few more general points. First, I think the title you have given this hearing captures the task well, ``Establishing a Framework for Systemic Risk Regulation.'' The task is not to enact one piece of legislation or to establish one overarching systemic risk regulator and then to move on. The shortcomings of our regulatory system were too widespread, the failure of risk management at financial firms too pervasive, and the absence of market discipline too apparent to believe that there was a single cause of, much less a single solution for, the financial crisis. We need a broad agenda of basic changes at our regulatory agencies and in financial firms, and a sustained effort to embed market discipline in financial markets. Second, the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem looms large on the agenda. Therein lies the importance of proposals to ensure that the systemically important institutions are subject to supervision, to promote capital and other kinds of rules that will apply more stringently because the systemic importance of an institution increases, and to establish a resolution mechanism that makes the prospect of losses for creditors real, even at the largest of financial institutions. But ``too-big-to-fail,'' for all its importance, was not the only problem left unaddressed for too long. The increasingly tightly wound connection between lending and capital markets, including the explosive growth of the shadow banking system, was not dealt with as leverage built up throughout the financial system. That is why there are also proposals before you pertaining to derivatives, money market funds, ratings agencies, mortgage products, procyclical regulations, and a host of other issues involving every financial regulator. Third, in keeping with my first point on a broad agenda for change, let me say a few words about the Federal Reserve. Even before my confirmation, I had begun conversations with many of you on the question of how to ensure that the shortcomings of the past would be rectified and the right institutional structure for rigorous and efficient regulation put in place, particularly in light of the need for a new emphasis on systemic risk. This colloquy has continued through the prior hearing your Committee conducted and in subsequent conversations that I have had with many of you. My colleagues and I have thought a good deal about this question and are moving forward with a series of changes to achieve these ends. For example, we are instituting closer coordination and supervision of the largest holding companies, with an emphasis on horizontal reviews that simultaneously examine multiple institutions. In addition, building on our experience with the SCAP process that drew so successfully upon the analytic and financial capacities of the nonsupervisory divisions of the Board, we will create a quantitative surveillance program that will use a variety of data sources to identify developing strains and imbalances affecting individual firms and large institutions as a group. This program will be distinct from the activities of the on-site examiners, so as to provide an independent perspective on the financial condition of the institutions. Fourth and finally, I would note that there are many possible ways to organize or to reorganize the financial regulatory structure. Many are plausible, but as experience around the world suggests, none is perfect. There will be disadvantages, as well as advantages, to even good ideas. One criterion, though, that I suggest you keep in mind as you consider various institutional alternatives is the basic principle of accountability. Collective bodies of regulators can serve many useful purposes: examining latent problems, coordinating a response to new problems, recommending new action to plug regulatory gaps, and scrutinizing proposals for significant regulatory initiatives from all participating agencies. When it comes to specific regulations or programs or implementation, though, collective bodies often diffuse responsibility and attenuate the lines of accountability, to which I know this Committee has paid so much attention. Achieving an effective mix of collective process and agency responsibility with an eye toward relevant institutional incentives will be critical to successful reform. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to answer any questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Dan. We appreciate your testimony and your involvement with the Committee, as well. I will ask the Clerk to put on--why don't you put on 6 minutes and try and keep an eye on that. We have got a lot of participation here this morning and I want to make sure we get around to people. I have asked the staff to make sure you give me a very accurate account of the arrival of Members in terms of the order in which they will be asked to address the questions to our panel. Let me begin with you, Governor Tarullo, if I can. I suspect a lot of the questions I am going to raise for you, you are going to hear variations of these same kind of questions, I suspect that sort of a theme will emerge here. You testified that the Administration's proposal to give the Fed systemic risk supervision is incremental. It builds on the robust authority which you already have under the Bank Holding Company Act, and you also detail your plan for a new surveillance program, which you mentioned here, for large complex financial organizations that will look at emerging risks to the system as a whole. Now, obviously, we are not speaking about you, because obviously you are new to this, but given the Federal Reserve's history and record on this as an institution as we look back, why should we in this Congress have any confidence in the Federal Reserve, other than what is being said today, and I appreciate what is being said today, but given the history of the Federal Reserve, you can argue that this authority has already existed. We don't need new authority. It has been there. Under the Bank Holding Company Act, you have had that authority for a long, long time. Certainly all the powers are there, the personnel, the resources to do a job, and yet there was an abysmal failure when it came to these institutions. So why at this juncture, and I raise this with you, why should this Committee or the Congress have any heightened degree of confidence that the Federal Reserve, having failed in that function, given the authority for years, should now be granted expanded authority in that same area?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, let me say a couple of things about that. First, as you know, in my prior capacity, I had a fairly broad-based set of criticisms about the Fed and the regulatory system as a whole. I continue to believe that when the final history of the financial crisis is written, there is going to be a lot of blame to go around to regulatory agencies and private institutions. This was not a single failing. This was a broad-based failing at home and, as we have seen, internationally as well. Let me be clear. I think that includes an inadequate or flawed approach to supervision at the banking agencies, including the Fed. Second, I will say that I think that history shifts. History shifts and the relative positions of agencies shift over time. I remember when I was in law school studying this set of issues that the Federal Reserve was regarded as the most aggressive of the regulatory agencies and the other agencies were regarded as somewhat more accommodating. So I think there is a rhythm that goes with the times, with the leadership of an agency, and with the general orientation of public policy. So, since I have gotten to the Fed--actually before that, since I began having conversations with you and other Members of the Committee--what I have been trying to determine is the degree to which the capacity and the resources are present to do what is in some sense the same job that should have been done better. But to be honest, in some sense, it is a different job because I don't think anybody actually was focused on the systemic part of the problem as much as they ought to have been. It was a more siloed approach to regulation. And that is why I also think some changes should be made in prevailing law so that it is clear that the supervisor of the holding companies has authority to do examinations of functionally regulated subsidiaries when it is necessary. Those sorts of things need to move forward. But, I think more fundamentally, what has to be done is the kind of thing I mentioned a moment ago, which is to put in place a system within the agency that has its own kind of cross-checks, drawing upon the substantial resources of the agency. There are substantial resources in the research and monetary affairs parts of the Board to provide exactly the kinds of information that will enhance supervision. And that is, I think, the task which someone is going to have to perform, Senator, and it is either going to be done by the Federal Reserve or another agency. It has got to be done somewhere. My belief is, based upon my 6 months' experience at the Fed, that under Chairman Bernanke's leadership, it can be done. But I don't think anyone should underestimate the task and I would just second something you said in your introductory remarks. I hope people are not expecting that anything that the Fed or the SEC or the FDIC or anybody else does is going to eliminate all potential for systemic risk. That is just not going to happen. And I think we have got to keep that in mind. Let me just say one final thing. The Administration's proposal and other proposals vary in how much authority they really mean to invest in a particular agency. Back at our March hearing, you and I talked back and forth a good bit about the different possible functions of a systemic risk regulator. With the possible exception of some of the proposals for the council as they have been described, most proposals don't talk about a systemic risk regulator. They talk about allocating a particular set of responsibilities to particular agencies or collective groups, and I think that is probably the way it should be. I really don't think you need or want so much responsibility, as well as authority, lodged in any one agency to say, you have responsibility for figuring out anywhere in the financial system there is a problem and you have authority to do whatever you think is necessary.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, let me--thank you for that. Let me, Sheila, quickly turn to you for two quick questions and let me play the devil's advocate, in a sense, in this, as well. And again, I am still sort of agnostic on this, although I am sort of leaning toward the council approach, but let me take the side of the argument that the Administration opposes and raise it with you. I will give my best shot here in giving their side of the argument. This is a new idea we are fooling around with, a council here, agencies that don't necessarily have the kind of expertise and background of the Federal Reserve. You are going to spread this out among a bunch of different agencies so no one is really in control or authority. The Federal Reserve has the experience. Yes, they have done a bad job of this over the years, but historically, they have the capacity, the knowledge, and so forth to do this. We know about the Fed. You are asking me to create something that is altogether new and it may not function well at all to handle the issue of systemic risk, a very important issue. Why should I take a leap of faith in something here creating a whole new entity that may include the Fed, but is going to have the problem of spreading out the responsibility in such a way that you will never figure out who is really running the shop? In a sense, systemic risk will be suffering terribly. Despite the fact you have given it a nice name, hired a bunch of nice people, it really will not make the kind of decisions that you need to have with a single regulator with the experience the Fed has to do the job. Why is that not a bad idea?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Obviously, we disagree with that. We think a council needs real teeth and rule-making authority. It needs to have some real authorities to be highly effective in monitoring for systemic risk and taking action to address it. The more eyes you have looking at this from different perspectives, the better. Clearly the FDIC has a different perspective from the SEC or the CFTC or the Federal Reserve. So I think bringing those multiple perspectives together is going to strengthen the entity, not weaken it. You are talking about tremendous regulatory power being invested in whatever this entity is going to be, and I think in terms of checks and balances, it is also helpful to have multiple views being expressed and coming to a consensus. We do a lot of this informally now, but there is no forcing mechanism. There are a lot of discussions now about OTC derivatives and trying to harmonize capital and margining standards. But having a formalized group with a head who is charged with dealing with those kinds of cross-cutting issues, harmonizing standards to make sure there is no regulatory arbitrage, and making sure risk throughout the system is being appropriated addressed, I think is extremely important. I think we have a bit of a middle ground in terms of institution regulation. We would not advocate the Federal Reserve losing its consolidated supervisory authorities now. They do that. They are the reservoir for that expertise. To the extent that there are other systemic institutions that are not under that prudential framework, we think the council should be able to make a determination regarding the consolidated supervision of those entities. But, it would be fine for the Federal Reserve to be the regulator for those systemic institutions. The kind of power that is contemplated in the U.S. Treasury White Paper, that we think, frankly, is needed, is much better vested in a council of regulators who I do believe can work together. The FDIC Board has three different agencies represented. We make decisions very quickly.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. I was going to ask you--I will wait for another round on the Consumer Financial Product Safety Agency idea. I will delay that for later. Let me turn to Senator Shelby.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Governor Tarullo, in your testimony, you appear to fully endorse the Obama administration's regulatory reform proposal. I am curious to know if you arrived at this position as a member of the Board of Governors after conducting an independent assessment of the plan, which I hope is the case. Otherwise, it would call into question the so-called ``independence'' of the Fed. Could you provide the Committee with the data and analysis that you used to make the determination that the Obama plan was the optimal approach?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, I actually wouldn't say that the Board's position is an endorsement of the Administration's plan. I think what you saw in my prepared testimony which reflects the position of the Board, is a sense that the Administration is moving in the right direction on these key components, that there are obviously lots of details, many of which, by the way, we don't know and didn't know based on the white paper and are only beginning to find out as they send up legislation to you.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","What about our legislation? They want to send it up, but don't you think we should be preparing our own legislation?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Absolutely. All I am saying is we couldn't figure out in some cases exactly what one of their proposals meant, which is why the testimony is phrased in such a way as to agree with the concept of needing to have every systemically important institution supervised and needing to have a resolution mechanism. As you probably saw, the Fed is certainly not endorsing the proposal of the Administration to create the new consumer agency. It is not opposing it, either.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Let me get into that a little bit. Safety and soundness regulation, very important here. In your testimony, you state there are synergies between the monetary policy and systemic risk regulation. In order to capture these synergies, you argue that the Fed should become a systemic risk regulator, as I understand it. Yesterday, Chairman Bernanke testified that he believed there are synergies between prudential bank regulation and consumer protection. This argues in favor of establishing one consolidated bank regulator. Do you agree with Chairman Bernanke that there are synergies between prudential supervision and consumer protection, and if so, do you believe that the Obama administration's call for a separate consumer protection agency would undermine the safety and soundness regulation that we have?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, as I said in my introductory comments, there are multiple ways to organize or to reorganize financial services regulation. Many times you have got competing ideas, each of which has merits and each of which has some demerits. With respect to the consumer protection issue, the Administration has made a proposal which I think a lot of people have some sympathy with because it focuses on consumer protection. We say we are going to give one agency the exclusive authority to regulate on consumer matters and thus they will be 100 percent devoted to doing that. My testimony is meant only to suggest that there are some things that would be lost by doing that as well as some things that would be gained, and what the Chairman, I think, was suggesting yesterday is that there is a synergy or interaction between prudential regulation and consumer protection regulation, at least if they are both being done well. That synergy is both in the substance of things--that is, having some sense of what makes an effective consumer protection regulation because you know the way in which the institutions operate--but also in the practical sense that as you have one corps of examiners, there is a certain economy of scope in having them looking at the multiple sets of issues within the same organization. So, I definitely think there are synergies. There are some benefits that go back and forth. If you take consumer protection away and put it in another agency, you probably lose some of those. I guess the Administration's position would be, yes, but you gain some things along the way.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Chairman Bair, the Obama administration's proposal, as I understand it, would have regulators designate certain firms as systemically important. You alluded to that earlier. These firms would be classified as Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies and would be subject to a separate regulatory regime. If some firms are designated as systemically important, would this signal to market participants that the Government will not allow these firms to fail? And if so, how would this worsen our ``too-big-to-fail'' problem?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","We do have concerns about formally designating certain institutions as a special class. At the same time, we recognize there may be very large interconnected financial entities out there that are not yet subject to Federal consolidated supervision. I think almost all of them already are subject to Federal consolidated supervision as a result of the crisis. But, some type of formal designation, I think, you would need to think hard about for just the reasons you expressed. Any recognition of an institution as being systemic, though, should be a stigmatizing designation, not something that is favorable. This is why we do feel so strongly that a robust resolution mechanism--for very large financial organizations needs to be combined with any type of new supervisory entity or to even recognize whether some institutions may be systemic.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Governor, I want to get back on the consumer protection. I have just got a second. There was testimony here last week on that, that this would change the whole model from a classical approach to consumer protection to a behavioral approach. Have you done some work in that area? Have you looked at that closely yet?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I have to be honest. I am not altogether sure what that refers to. I can only tell you-- again, based on what I have learned since I have been at the Fed--the way in which the division there does consumer protection and generates proposals is one that has a fairly important behavioral orientation, up to and including the fact that there is extensive consumer testing done before regulations are presented to the Board to make sure, for example, that if what you are trying to do is disclose terms of a consumer contract, that the kind of terms you are disclosing will actually mean something to a consumer and be useful to them. So in that sense, it is not just a top-down inquiry--how would the rational person think--but you actually try to determine how real people really do think.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","It would put a lot of power in bureaucrats, would it not?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","To create a----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","No, if we created something like they proposed, which I hope we won't, it would put a lot of power in the bureaucrats.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, it depends, Senator. I mean, obviously, it depends on the mandate and the scope. That is obviously to be determined by all of you. I think that people at the Fed would agree strongly with the proposition that there needs to be good, solid consumer protection in the financial services area. Obviously, we also think that should be done in a well- organized fashion with due process for everyone involved.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and I just point out that it was, as Jim Bunning has pointed out on countless occasions and others have, we gave the Fed the authority in 1994 to deal with consumer protection. It took them 14 years to finally promulgate a single regulation in the area, so I appreciate the concern about consumer protection.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bair, Chairman Schapiro, and Governor Tarullo. I will start with Chairman Bair, but this is a general question for everyone. As I understand the proposals by the White House, the OTS would be eliminated, so effectively all Financial Holding Company regulation would be lodged under the Federal Reserve, that there would, in fact, be at least a review and perhaps the elimination of the Unitary Savings and Loan Holding Company Act. Those institutions would be Financial Holding Companies under the Federal Reserve. So direct regulation after this legislation by the Fed would comprise most of, if not all of, the systemic institutions, save perhaps some insurance companies that might be outside, and we have to deal with that, and some very large hedge funds or maybe not so large hedge funds but operating very recklessly. So with that framework, what does the council--how does the council relate now to a regulator that has full direct authority, and in fact in the proposal would eliminate the functional--the deference to functional regulators, so that the Fed, I think, could look through every part of the institution? What role does the council play there in that reality, or should play?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I think there are still issues across markets. Even when functions within the holding company are individually regulated, there will still be some practices and products that other nonsystemic institutions may be doing. Mortgage originations are a prime example. You had a lot of very small third-party mortgage brokers originating some pretty bad mortgages that were being funded through multiple sources, including nonregulated finance companies, Wall Street firms, et cetera. So I think that there is plenty of opportunity for risk to be assessed across the system by any entity in terms of products and practices. Even within large holding companies, there will be reservoirs of expertise. There will be expertise in investment banks and broker-dealers from the SEC. There will be expertise regarding State-chartered and nationally chartered banks from the new prudential OCC-OTS regulator and the FDIC. I think in particular, capital standards--applying them across the board, making sure that there are no opportunities for arbitrage going forward--is a very major issue. I think OTC derivatives, some derivatives, are going to be traded on exchanges. Some are going to be traded through central counterparties. Others are still going to be done by OTC derivative market makers. Seeing how margining and capital across the system affects incentives, and whether we can all get together to incentivize more standardized trading, are all interagency matters that I think cry out for coordination across agency rule making. I actually see a lot for the council to do, even preserving the Fed's authority to be an institutional regulator for major holding companies.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Just specifically, would the council, in your view, designate the Tier 1 or the entities----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","That is tremendous power, to say to an institution, whether you want to be regulated or not, we are going to designate you as Tier 1. I do think that that power is needed, but I think it is better to be exercised by a council where there would be a diversity of views and some checks and balances.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","And the council would formally begin the resolution process?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I think we could discuss that. We have been talking about that a lot internally. I think, certainly for systemic institutions or institutions where the resolution might have systemic impact, that might be a role for the council. On the other hand, to the extent resolution will involve potential at least short-term assistance, I think the current approach, what we call the three keys now, the FDIC, the Fed, the Treasury, in consultation with the President, might be another model to look at. Those are the three entities that actually have to put the money on the table, so to speak, to deal with the situation. That is the way the system works now. If you rely on that system, though, we think the systemic risk exception, as I indicated in my testimony, should be tightened so it is harder, much harder to provide assistance, at least to individual institutions.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Let me ask Chairman Schapiro, and I do want Governor Tarullo to comment, too.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you. I really agree very much with what Sheila has said. I think a council is really critical to bring a diversity of views about the financial markets to the deliberations of all the regulators and this diversity of views really does need to reach across equity markets, futures and derivatives markets, the banking institutions, the clearance and settlement systems, and across a huge variety of different products. And if we don't bring the diverse perspectives together, we run the risk of any one regulator not appreciating a risk that is developing or not understanding the risk that may impact other financial institutions for which that regulator doesn't have direct responsibility. So I think both the ability to designate the institutions that need to be subject to additional risk-type regulation and establish capital standards, liquidity requirements, other risk management procedures for those institutions, in conjunction with the primary regulators, is a very important backstop.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Governor Tarullo, you have 40 seconds. This is the lightning round.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Senator, I think it depends a lot on how you structure things. I guess one model--maybe this is what Sheila and Mary are talking about--has the council basically as the rule-making entity for things that are systemically important, the designation of the Tier 1, the capital rules, I assume deposit insurance premiums to the degree that they are affecting the system, as well, and money market fund regulation. And then the question for you, for everybody, is going to be, do you want a system in which each major regulation that has systemic importance--as Chairman Schapiro said, something that will affect regulated entities of the other regulators--do you want that done formally in a council by a vote of some sort, or do you want it to be done through a lot of scrutiny, a lot of discussion, perhaps bringing in outsiders as well as-- those people outside from the Government or from the Congress as well as from the agencies to ask the hard questions--to require the agency that has responsibility and accountability for that regulation to defend it, to make it a better regulation, but then ultimately to itself have the responsibility to implement it. And I think that is the choice, and that is what I was alluding to earlier in terms of the tradeoff. Do you get the incentives right?",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Reed.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","",Speech,
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I thank each of you for your testimony. Chairman Bair, I very much, as you know, support your outlook as it relates to the resolution issue, and I am surprised at the Administration's proposal and wanting to continue to support companies that fail, much like is being done with TARP, and I hope that that will evolve. But let me just ask you this: On the issue of systemic risk, if there had been a resolution mechanism in place, would that not have actually--even though there was risk in the market, would that not have actually reduced the risk to some degree? In other words, if you had the appropriate ability to deal with a Lehman Brothers or an AIG, would that actually have reduced the risk to the system in the first place?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I think it would have, for two reasons. One, if it had already been in place for some time, I think we would have had better market discipline across the system. Second, when the problems hit--and we will always have cycles, hopefully never as severe as this one, but we will always have cycles--there would have been a consistent statutory mechanism in place that could be applied to all of these institutions which would have reduced market uncertainty about who was going to be next and who was going to win and who was going to lose. So I absolutely think it would have reduced risk in the system going into this crisis if we had had such a resolution mechanism in place.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","I think that is really a big point. I think that is something that--you know, we are looking at creating something new, and I know we will debate that, and we may come up with the right solution. But the fact of the matter is if we had just had effective market disciplines in the first place where there were not entities that were too-big-to-fail, they could actually fail, the risk itself would have been less, and I think that is an important point. Let me ask you another question. I have served on several public company boards, and certainly not the size of the companies we are talking about here, but I have been before lots of them, and each of the board members typically are respected individuals that have a focus on their own companies, and I respect people in that position very much. But is there something we should be thinking about as it relates to boards? My guess is most board members show up, really do not know, excuse the language, squat about what is going on inside the company. It is a nice social event. It is just the way boards are set up, and most CEOs like it that way.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Is this an admission on your part?",Speech,
"Senator Corker","No, no, no. I was very----",Speech,
"Senator Corker","I was not serving on highly social boards, but, you know, it is a fact. I mean, let us face it. The board members really, as good as they are, the respected individual, they have their own companies. They have their own fish to fry in many cases. They really do not know what is happening inside these companies, and the greatest regulation would just be knowing that people are on these boards and they actually understand what is happening inside the company. Again, I know most CEOs do not like that much, but I wonder if you might respond, both Mary and Sheila, to that--excuse me, Chairman and Chairman, to that.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","``Mary'' is just fine. I actually think governance is an enormous issue here, and I do not think it is by malintention or neglect that so many of these institutions got into so much trouble. But I do think we have serious examples of boards that were not paying close enough attention or did not actually understand the business the company was in. I think from the perspective of the SEC, there are a couple things we want to do about that coming directly out of the financial crisis. One is we have proposed some new rules that require much greater disclosure in the proxy when shareholders get to vote about a board member's qualifications to serve on that particular board and a risk committee or a compensation committee or other committee that might require particular expertise. So we can encourage boards to nominate people to sit on their boards who actually bring that value to the company. I think the second big problem is with compensation schemes. To the extent that compensation schemes in some of these institutions really incentivize excessive risk taking, holding boards accountable through better disclosure of compensation schemes and the link between compensation programs and risk taking I think will help shareholders do a better job of holding the boards accountable for how they are utilizing compensation.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Yes, I think that the direction the SEC is going is great and much needed. Our own focus with regulated banks, obviously, where our examiners identify weaknesses in management, we look to the bank's board of directors. We want to make sure the board has people who understand banking and can oversee management, but also really their primary responsibility is to make sure that the management knows how to run the bank and will run the bank in a safe and sound manner. So we have put a focus on this, and I believe the Federal Reserve has as well at the holding company level. We want real boards. We want people who are experienced, who know what is going on in their company, who understand the derivative positions and the risks they are taking and how their compensation structures impact risk-taking behavior.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","I know the first question any board member, a potential board member is asked, the first question they ask the company is: How much insurance do you have? Right? I mean, you know, ``I want to be able to be on this board, but I do not want any liability, and if the insurance is not enough, I am not coming on.'' And I just think that is something that we ought to consider as we move ahead, again, not--without any disrespect to the individuals themselves. So I think if the resolution had been in place, the risk would have been less. If we had boards that somehow had some stake in the game or some different relationship, that would reduce risk. So let me move back to the notion of a systemic regulator, which I know we will debate, but what powers, Mr. Tarullo, if Company A was engaging in buying one side of a risk in a major way, unintelligently, what would the power of the systemic regulator be to stop that action?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, again, it depends on how Congress would choose to define a systemic risk regulator. If you are asking could the Federal Reserve deal with it, it would depend, of course, on whether it was a supervised institution or not, because if it is not a supervised institution, we have no authority over them.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","I am talking about--forget all the--just tell me, I mean, at the end of the day, if you are going to give a systemic regulator the ability to do something, if they saw something that was creating a risk, what power would it be given? I think we would all like to understand. What exactly would they do in that case?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","So, I think here it is important to draw this distinction. Right now, if we have a supervised institution, there is a set of rules and supervisory expectations. There are rules on leverage, rules on capital, rules on liquidity. They are supposed to be conforming to those, and if they are conforming to those, there should be a containment of the kind of risks you are talking about. The backup effort there is supervisory examination, which goes beyond the rules, and if that works well, it identifies these things, and then allows the supervisor to give guidance to the firm to say we think you ought to be moving away from this practice or it creates certain risks. But I think your question raises an important point, which is--let us just assume the Administration's proposal on Tier 1 FHCs was enacted--there would still be a substantial universe of firms out there which would not be regulated by the Fed, which might be engaging in the kind of practices you are talking about. Even if no one firm is systemically important, in the aggregate a practice engaged in by a lot of firms can still create problems. So you would have to ask who would be able to regulate that.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","My time is up. I think that answer was really interesting, Mr. Chairman, from this standpoint: Nothing--I mean, the answer is nothing. So the notion of having a single person, a single entity overseeing so they can act swiftly is not even relevant, because there would be no power. Again, if it is all conversation, looking, regulation, those things can be done by a group. And I just think that is worthy of hearing one of the Governors saying, no action. So----",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, could I just--just slightly amend or add to what I said. It is important to look to see what those rules are that prevail. The rules on leverage, the rules on capital, the rules on liquidity are themselves supposed to be based upon concepts of risk, and I believe they are based upon concepts of risk, which should contain these kinds of risks I mentioned. I think that if you set the rules properly, you have gotten a fair way down the line to containing risks within those institutions. What I was saying before about the backup supervisory examination authority is there can still be practices that arise that somehow are evading the rules or are not falling under the rules, and then you need to determine whether it is an unsafe and unsound practice and make a judgment about that. So, I do not think anybody should promise to you that as soon as any firm starts doing anything dangerous that some regulator is going to see it and be able to stop it. It is going to have to evolve over time. If the rules are set right, you should be containing a good bit of that to begin with.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","",Speech,
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All of you have talked about regulatory gaps and systemic risk in all of this. Mr. Tarullo, one of the points that you made was on accountability, you have got to be able--you cannot diffuse the responsibility. Later on, you talked about silos and that, and I do not want to put words in your mouth, but you were opposed to one agency that could determine the problem and determine the solution to the problem. And I may be wrong in what I heard in that, but that is what I thought I heard. You know, we are at a point where we know there are regulatory failures, and I think there is an opportunity to fix that. I think that is what the President put forth with this proposal. But shouldn't we push for further consolidation to stop the gaps, to allow ourselves to really focus and have that accountability that you talked in one of your main points, more consolidation than even here.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I keep referring to my prior life, but it turns out to have been relevant for this job, which I guess is a good thing. I spent a good bit of time as an academic looking at the different ways in which countries structured their regulatory systems, and there are some countries--the U.K. and Japan notable among them--that have tried fundamentally to consolidate all financial regulation in a single entity. I do not think there is any denying that there are some advantages to that. You do get some of the cross-pollination of views. You do balance your incentives to foster the system but protect, for example, the deposit insurance fund. You get a lot of those incentives. I think, though, that many people in those countries would also say there are downsides to that as well. The advent of the crisis in the U.K. suggested to a lot of people that that model was not a fail-safe either. I should say the Fed does not have a position on more consolidation, less consolidation. But just as a kind of policy observation, I think there would be gains to trying to get more focus and consolidation so that you have some sense of who is accountable for what. But I think most of us--and I suspect all three of us at the table here--would also agree that some measure of redundancy is actually not a bad thing; that is, sometimes, you want accountability, but sometimes it is not the worst thing in the world to have multiple pairs of eyes, and even somewhat overlapping authorities.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","I would agree with that, but then what happens with the instrument that is developed that has no regulation and falls in those gaps that we talked about and then everybody says it was----",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","I think that is a very good point, and so I think the question for you will be: In the architecture that you all may choose to legislate, do you provide that somewhere there is going to be a residual or default authority to address the unanticipated?",Speech,
"Senator Tester","OK. Chairman Bair, the Administration proposes factoring in a firm's size and leverage and the impact its failure would have on the financial system and the economy when determining if a firm is systemically important. It is kind of a two-edged sword once again, but if the firm size is-- and the metrics are developed around that--and we can talk about what those metrics might be, and we might if we have time. But wouldn't that provide--from a safety standpoint, wouldn't that provide a competitive advantage for those bigger banks versus the community banks if, in fact, their size and leverage determined them to be--they cannot fail, so we are going to make sure that they do not through the regulation?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, we think any designation of ``systemic'' should be a bad thing, not a good thing. That is one of the reasons why we suggest there should be a special resolution regime to resolve large, interconnected firms. It is the same as the regime that applies to small banks. Also, they should have to pay assessments to prefund a reserve that could provide working capital if they have to be resolved. We are not sure you need a special Tier 1 category. We think the assessment, for instance, could apply to any firm that could be systemic, perhaps based on some dollar threshold or some other criteria that could be used as a means of the first cut of who should pay the assessment. But you are right, if you have any kind of systemic determination, without a robust resolution authority--and, again, we think assessments for a prefunded reserve would be helpful as well--it is going to be viewed as a reward. It is going to reinforce ``too-big- to-fail,'' not end it, and you want to end it.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","So I am not tracking as a consumer. How would you stop it from being a reward and not----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","You would need a resolution mechanism that works. So if they become nonviable, if they could not exist without Government support, the Government would not support them. They would close them. They would impose losses on their shareholders and creditors. The management would be gone, and they would be sold off. That is what we do with----",Speech,
"Senator Tester","So too big----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","----smaller banks.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","Excuse me, but ``too-big-to-fail'' would go away?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, I hope so. I certainly hope so. I think that should be the policy goal. Right now it was a doctrine that fed into lax market discipline that contributed to this crisis. I think the problem is even worse now because, lacking an adequate resolution mechanism, we have had to step in and provide a lot of open bank assistance.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","And I have heard from other participants, and I would just like to get your perspective. They would go away by increased regulation----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","No. I think ``too-big-to-fail'' would be addressed by increased supervision combined with increased market discipline, which we think you can get through a resolution mechanism.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","Thank you. Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Johnson","Senator Johanns.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Let me just say this has been just a very, very interesting discussion. I appreciate you being here. I will tell you what I said a few weeks back, maybe a couple months back. I tend to favor the council. The idea of the Federal Reserve I think is just fraught with a lot of problems, so at least today that is where I am thinking about this. But the discussion today has really raised, I think--in my mind at least--some very important fundamental questions. It seems to me if you have a council, Chairman Bair, I would tend to agree with you that the council would designate who is classified as somebody who would fit within this. But that raises the issue: How broad is that power? Which probably brings us back to even a more fundamental question of what are we meaning by systemic risk. Is that an institution that is so entangled with the overall economy that if they go down, it could literally shake the economy or bring the economy down? Is that what we are thinking about here?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I think you are, and I think it should be a very high standard. I also believe through more robust regulation, higher standards for large, complex entities, a robust resolution mechanism, as well as an assessment mechanism, that you will provide disincentives for institutions to become that large and complex as opposed to now where all the incentives are to become so big that they can basically blackmail us because of a disorderly resolution. This is one of the things that we lack, a statutory scheme that allows the Government the powers it needs to provide a resolution on an orderly basis. It rewards them for being very large and complex.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","So under that analysis, very, very clearly you could have a large banking operation fall within that. But you could also have a very large insurance company fall within that.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","You could. That is right.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","You could have a very large power generating company fall within that. What if I somehow have the wealth and capital access to start buying power generation, and all of a sudden, someday you kind of look up and I own 60 percent of it. Now, that is a huge risk to the economy. If I go under, power generation is at risk. Is that what we are talking about?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","No. I think we are talking about financial intermediaries. There are things that need to be addressed with respect to financial intermediaries such as the reliance on short-term liabilities to fund themselves as well as the creditors, and the borrowers, who are dependent on financial intermediaries for continuing credit flows. So there are things that are different about financial intermediaries that make it more difficult to go through the standard bankruptcy process, which can be uncertain. You cannot plan for it. The Government cannot plan for it. They cannot control the timing for it, and it can be very protracted and take years. And the banking process is focused on maximizing returns for creditors as opposed to our resolution mechanism, which is designed to protect insured depositors, but also to make sure there is a seamless transition so there are no disruptions, especially for insured depositors, but also for borrowers. Through that process, through the combination of the supervisory process plus our legal authorities for resolution, we are able to plan for these failures and deal with them in advance. And I would assume that this would be the same situation you would have--as Senator Reed pointed out, with the Federal Reserve that virtually regulates almost every financial holding company already. Certainly if you do away with the thrift charter, that would be the case. I would also say that I really do not think a very large plain-vanilla property and casualty insurer would be systemic. I think AIG got into trouble because it deviated from its bread-and-butter property and casualty insurance and went into very high-risk, unregulated activities. But if you penalize institutions for being systemically significant, you will reinforce incentives to stick to your knitting, stick to more basic lower-risk activities as opposed to getting into the higher-risk endeavors that can create systemic risk for us all, as we have seen.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Chairman Schapiro, do you agree with that?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I do agree with that. I think if you have an adequate resolution mechanism that the marketplace understands will, in fact, be used, it can cancel out effectively the competitive advantage that might be perceived to exist for an institution that is systemically important and, therefore, the Government will not let it fail. If people understand in the marketplace the institutions will be unwound, they will be permitted to fail, then they should not have that competitive advantage that ``too-big-to-fail'' would give them. I also think that a council will be much better equipped to make an expert judgment across the many different types of financial institutions that we have in this country about which ones are systemically significant and important.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Governor, what are your thoughts?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I guess I basically agree, but maybe with a couple of qualifications. I think that the resolution mechanism is an important component of any program to address ``too-big-to-fail.'' But as with each of the other components, I do not think we should look at it as a panacea. This is not something that we have done before. It is something we think needs to be done. And I agree with Senator Corker's earlier observation that if it had been in place before, it would have reduced risk. But note, he did not say eliminate the risk and eliminate the problem, and I agree with that. I think you are going to need a good, sound resolution mechanism. I think you are going to need other mechanisms to enhance market discipline as well--the capital structure of the firm, for example. And I think you are also going to need sound, transparent regulations because I do not think going forward we can rely on any one instrument. We are going to have to rely on a set of instruments to try to contain this problem.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","My time has expired, but if I could just offer this thought: I think the Chairman is absolutely right. I do not notice any political agenda here. I do not think it is a partisan sort of thing we are trying to come to grips with. My hope is that as we start working through this and putting pen to paper, the Administration will look at this from the standpoint of there are a lot of ways of dealing with this problem and preventing what happened and avoid locking down on just a single approach, like it has got to be the Federal Reserve or it cannot be anything, because I do think you can come at this from a number of different angles. But having said that, I will again reiterate I am hoping at some point we can move beyond the ``who manages this'' and resolve that issue, because there are some very, very important issues about who does this apply to. What are the unintended consequences of trying to define that? And I think that is where you really get into where the rubber meets the road here, is how you structure this in a way that makes sense, that deals with the problem, without going off on a cul-de-sac that really is not where we want to be today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, let me just say--and I appreciate my friend and colleague's comments, because he is on track and I agree with him. And my sense is with the Administration as well that this is a dynamic process. They are sending up ideas and proposals to us, and that is as they should do, I suspect. But my sense of it is as well that I do not get a locked down view on this. So I think we are still very much in that dynamic process of thinking through these ideas, and you are absolutely correct, we are spending a lot of time on the who. But Bob Corker raised, I think, an important question that I have raised any number of times. It is not just the who but what. What powers? Just identifying who is going to be a systemic risk is an important question, but what powers are you going to give them is an equally important question, if you are going to give them any powers at all, in a sense. So I think there are a lot of really important issues, and, again, I am very optimistic about the process that we have in place here for arriving at some of these answers. So I thank my colleague very much for his observation on that. Senator Bennet of Colorado.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to pick up right where you left off and where Senator Johanns left off, because I think--it is, by the way, a fascinating conversation. I appreciate all of you being here today. I think this is fraught with incredible amounts of potential unintended consequences, and we need to be enormously careful about keeping our mind or our focus on what is the problem that we are trying to solve here, because I am enormously skeptical of our ability to predict--or the regulatory agency's ability to predict these economic cycles and then to be able to respond in a way that does not actually compound the problem that we are facing. I think we have just seen 20 years of leverage piling up on our system and lack of attention to that that has led to the destruction of, you know, our economy and the dreams of a lot of people who live in my State and other States. I fully agree that we need to--that having resolution authority in place would have made an enormous difference in this case and kept us out of the Alice in Wonderland world that we are in now where we are having conversations here about how people get paid in private institutions where the taxpayer has actually had to come to the rescue of firms that we should never have had to rescue. I think both the Fed Chairman and the Treasury Secretary have been doing good work trying to get us out of here, and I think they are right to say that we were left with an assortment of terrible choices and we took the least bad. And I think our objective here needs to be to make sure we never find ourselves in that place again. I guess the question that I have for you, Chairman Bair, is when you talk about a council--and, again, I do not have anything against a council or any of this, and it might help. But when you talk about a council that anticipates risk, I think I get that. I am a little skeptical, but I get it. You also talked about a council that mitigates risk. Could you tell us more about what that means, if you would put some flesh on those bones for us?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Mitigate or reduce risk--you cannot get risk completely out of the system. We are a capitalist system, so there has got to be some risk and return. But I think excessive risk perhaps would be a better example. In terms of the powers of the systemic risk council, I would put prudential requirements at the top of my list, and requirements for capital and margining and other constraints on leverage. There was too much leverage that had been built up on the system, and we believe that this council should have the authority to set minimum standards. For example, if the council decides that the FDIC is not setting high enough capital standards for its banks, or if the Federal Reserve is not setting high enough standards for its bank holding companies, or having high enough standards for the quality of capital, the council could step in and raise those standards. So I think there are some checks and balances as well that you get that you may not with vesting all this power in one single entity.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","That is an interesting idea, and would the effect of that be to remove some of the risk of regulatory capture of the other agency?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I think that is exactly right.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","This is a question for the panel generally. One thing we have learned in this economic crisis is that the United States economy is in no way isolated from the rest of the world. As we think about this set of new laws and regulations, how should we think about how we connect to the rest of the world and the regulators connect to regulators across the globe?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think we should lead the world. I do not think we should wait for the rest of the world, or we could be waiting a very long time--at least in my limited experience with some of these international groups. I think especially on resolution authority they are looking to the United States to define the model. So I think you should seize the moment and forge ahead and lead, not follow, because I do think there are still a lot of folks looking to us for leadership, and I think we can help define what the international standards ultimately will be.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","Mr. Chairman, I will end just by saying that I hope that whatever it is we arrive at here and whatever we do, the Administration leads toward a bias that when firms need to fail, they fail, and we can make sure we do that in an orderly way and that we are not ever again in the circumstance we are in today, which is to prop up institutions simply because we had no other good choice. These were problems that were avoidable, and it is just a shame that the taxpayers have found themselves where we are. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. I couldn't agree more, and the point has been made by several, the options being, one, to pour billions in or to collapse them. There have to be alternatives within those two bookends that give us far more flexibility to respond to these situations. If we don't do anything else, I think a resolution mechanism is going to be a tremendously important contribution to this. And again, I think as I listen--as the Chair of this Committee, my job is in part to listen to all of my colleagues--and as I listen to this, while we haven't settled on a process yet, I am certainly beginning to sense a consensus developing around the importance of that issue, so I thank my colleagues and thank Senator Bennet for raising that issue again.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask unanimous consent to enter my opening statement into the record.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, and I would ask that of all my colleagues, as well.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK. Chairman Bair, I have asked you this question before and probably will ask you again. When do you expect to end the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","October 31.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","For sure?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","For sure, yes. All indications are that we will be able to exit the program, yes. The guaranteed balances are down. Use of the program is down significantly. And yes, I anticipate we will be in a very good position to exit October",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Good. This is for all of the witnesses. This question has two parts. As I have said before, I doubt we can create a regulator that will be able to see and stop systemic risk. So the first question for each of you is, if you really think Government can assemble a regulator that will not be outsmarted by Wall Street, first of all--in other words, can the Government really understand what the financial industries are doing and spot the risk ahead of time, or at least as they are happening? And second, it seems to me a more practical and effective way to limit the damage firms can do is to limit their size and exposure to other firms, in other words, the interaction between major firms. That also has a benefit of allowing the free markets to operate, but within reasonable limits. My question for each of you is do you agree with that, and answer also the first one, if you will. You can all take a shot at it, in no order.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I will be happy to. Look, we can have better quality regulation. We can have more even regulation. But regulation will never correct all of this. You need more robust market discipline, which is why we really need an effective resolution mechanism. The market will then understand that when these institutions get into trouble, those who invested with them or extended credit to them are going to take losses. On the interconnectedness and exposures, yes, Senator, I think you are absolutely right to focus on that. One thing we suggest in our testimony that would be an area ripe for consideration through a council, if it is formed, would be whether there should be some limits on the firms' reliance on short-term liabilities.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, shouldn't we include everything, though?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","In other words, we are talking about things that are not regulated at all. Secretary Chairman Reed and myself are having hearings on those things outside the regulatory bodies right now.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Right. So I think you are right. The relationships of financial intermediaries to other entities in the economy, stress testing those on a marketwide basis, are all things that require a lot of interagency cooperation and something that the council would be well-equipped to provide. You are absolutely right. Interconnectedness is a key indicator of systemic risk and it is something, I think, we can do a better job addressing through regulation in containing risk.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Ms. Schapiro.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, I think we can do better as regulators. We will never be perfect, but we can certainly do better.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","We all know that, so you don't have to----",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I thought self-confession was helpful here.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I think we can constrain risk taking through heightened capital requirements, more effective capital requirements, margin. But I really want to address your second question because I think it is particularly important in the context, for example, of over-the-counter derivatives, which trade in the hundreds of trillions of dollars on a bilateral or counterparty to counterparty basis, without transparency, without in many instances sufficient margin or collateral behind those positions.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Our markets, they just trade.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Exactly right. And so the goal of moving as many of those transactions onto central clearing platforms so that we take out the counterparty risk and remove the bilateral nature of those contracts so a clearinghouse is interposed between all the parties, I think would do an enormous amount to reduce the systemic risk and reduce the exposure of financial institutions to each other----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Just by registering?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","By clearing them through a central----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Clearing.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","----through a central clearinghouse.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK. Mr. Tarullo.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, with respect to the first part of your question, I would agree and go further, actually. I think part of what we have observed is not only that Government observers can't figure out every instance of systemic risk, but market participants themselves are sometimes unaware of the fact that they are engaging in practices that are subject to the domino effect of everything falling down. I don't think that means we should give up. I think it means we have to go into the exercise with a realistic sense of what you can and cannot accomplish. You are going to have false positives and you are going to have false negatives, which means that there needs to be a certain modesty associated with the exercise. But I do think that with efforts to quantify--to get data in a standardized form where you see the amount of leverage building up in different parts of the economy--you can take some steps down the road. Your interconnectedness point, I think, is critical. That is why we suggested in the prepared testimony that in thinking about capital regulation for larger firms, one should try to devise a metric that looks at interconnectedness, that looks at the very things that create systemic risk, rather than just replicate the siloed approach to capital regulation we have had in the past.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Let me get my last question in, and this is for Sheila. All the largest institutions, financial institutions, have international ties, or at least most of them, and money can flow across borders very easily. AIG is probably the best known example of how problems can cross borders. How do you deal with the risk created in our country by actions somewhere else as well as the impact of actions on the U.S. markets themselves?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think the international component of this is very difficult, and that is why I said earlier, I think we should try to lead and set the standards which then we can try to leverage into international agreements, especially when these large institutions get into trouble. The FDIC cochairs a working group with the Basel Committee to address the situation where a U.S. firm with large international operations gets into trouble, or vice-versa. One advantage we have here in the United States is that we require banks to be chartered here--organized under our laws, insured separately, and regulated as if they were domiciled here. So there is some insulation for U.S. customers of those entities if they get into trouble. We do not require the opposite, though--that our banks and financial institutions doing business overseas must be organized separately. So we suggest in our written testimony that this might be something to think about. Clearly, with greater legal autonomy and organization within each of these home jurisdictions, if the entity does get into trouble, it makes the resolution a lot simpler.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow--thank you all for joining us and thank you, each of you, for your public service in very trying, difficult times. I want to follow up on Chairman Dodd's discussion or allusion to the powers given to the systemic risk regulator. I was intrigued by Senator Bunning's statement that we not be outsmarted by Wall Street and that we in the Senate not be outsmarted by Wall Street, that you as regulators in the structure we build not be outsmarted by Wall Street. And I think sort of the longer time you spend here watching, whether it is the financial system or the health care system or anything else, history is replete with industry always trying to, in some sense--not accusing of illegality, but in some sense staying ahead of the sheriff, that they are always trying to find a way around whatever rules we write, whether it is health insurance companies gaming the system and we try to write rules for them or whether it is financial institutions or anything else in the whole regulatory system structure that we have built. I ask you, and I would start with Mr. Tarullo, but I would like all of you to just comment on it. Give me sort of a prescriptive walk-through of what, in fact, we are able to do with the--what kind of powers the systemic risk regulator should have to prevent another mortgage meltdown. Be as specific as you can walking through for us in very understandable terms about what kind of powers the systemic risk regulator has to prevent those kind of market meltdowns, if you would.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","So Senator, again, I just want to qualify the notion of systemic risk regulator, because again, it depends on how many of those powers you invest in a particular agency. I would say, getting at Senator Dodd's perspective, as to where the powers ought to be. I think you are going to need simple, straightforward but strong rules to get at things like leverage for precisely the reason you said. If you try to go too activity-specific, you are always going to have people arbitraging and trying to do something that accomplishes the same end. So one has to look to overarching rules that provide some constraint upon it. I would say that is number one. Number two, I think you do have to have an adaptable set of regulators and supervisors who are looking at emerging practices and are able to--and have the backup authority to act against those practices. Number three, and I guess I would say in the consumer protection arena, I think that there--most importantly of all-- you probably needed a change in attitude. I think--again, as an academic, teaching through the 2000s--during that period, I just didn't see an enormous amount of interest in financial services consumer protection, frankly, at any of the financial regulatory agencies. There was, as Senator Dodd pointed out, power to take action. There was certainly examination authority. Each of the agencies had things they could have done. Perhaps not everything. They couldn't have stopped some things, but could certainly have stopped a lot. So, I actually do think in the consumer protection area the basic problem is one of attitude, orientation, and leadership.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Would you--and I want to hear from the two Chairs, too, but would you in writing discuss with me, because I want to get to them, what you mean by change in attitude, and more importantly, how we get there, how we----",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Sure.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Just send me a letter about that----",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Happy to.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","----if you would think about it and come up with it.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","OK. Chairman Schapiro.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you. Well, I would agree with you. It is always a challenge for regulators to keep up with the latest financial innovation and the latest trading practices, product designs from Wall Street. I would say, I think to some extent, Wall Street outsmarted itself over the last couple of years and not just the regulators, which is why, through a lack of good risk management procedures, perhaps a lack of understanding entirely the nature of the businesses they were engaged in or the degree to which they were dependent upon counterparties is significant contributors to the situation. I think there are a few things we can do and we really must do. We have got to bring unregulated products under the regulatory umbrella. I talked already about OTC derivatives and I won't go back through that, but I think it is a very significant gap. I think we have to be much more robust about capital requirements and risk management procedures within the firms. We have to have regulators who are willing to be skeptical every single day and every hour of every day about the quality of risk management procedures within the firms that we are all responsible for regulating. I think we have to have an across-the-board commitment to much more robust stress testing so that we are thinking more about the huge impact but low probability events and factoring that into how we go forward with our regulatory programs. And to refer back to something we talked about with Senator Corker, I think we need to find ways to encourage more engaged and knowledgeable boards in these financial institutions.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","OK. Chairman Bair.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Specifically focusing on the resolution mechanism, under the regime we would suggest going forward, a Wall Street firm couldn't come and ask for assistance from the Government without submitting to a resolution procedure, meaning that they would be closed. So I think that they will stop asking, number one, if that is the tradeoff. I do agree that there has been some Balkanization of regulatory responsibility . That is why we think a council with ownership and a clear statutory mandate to be responsible for the system, addressing systemic risk, and getting ahead of systemic risk, will help change that attitude. It would get us all working together as opposed to saying that it is not really my agency's responsibility. I do think the ability of the council to set minimum standards, as well, will be an important check against regulatory capture or perhaps a lax attitude. That is another feature that could create a more robust regulatory environment.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Bair, I am going to focus most of my questions on you, although I may, if I have time, be able to get to the others on the same issue. I am going to focus on the resolution authority issue again. I know that you have proposed that the resolution authority be with the FDIC and that it be expanded to bank holding companies and there is a bit of a discussion as to how broadly it should be expanded and where this authority should reside, or should be placed. But when you look at the issue of the need for a resolution authority, we have, first of all, the fact that right now, we only have resolution authority for banks. You indicated that we should expand that to bank holding companies. We also have the issue or a piece of the issue that Senator Bunning raised with regard to international holdings and what we deal with when we have American institutions that have acquired sometimes dozens if not hundreds of foreign subsidiaries and how we deal with those kinds of jurisdictional issues. I would just be curious as to your thoughts about where should the resolution authority be placed--I think I know the answer to that--but also how broad do we need to be in terms of the establishment of such resolution authority.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, as you said, for bank holding companies, the FDIC would like to be the resolution authority simply because we already are for the insured depository institutions and you need a consistent single unified resolution regime. For other types of entities, if Congress wanted to give us that authority, we would take it. We are really the only place where this very specialized expertise resides. We have closed over 3,000 institutions throughout our existence, small ones, large ones, and we have the staff and the ability to ramp up very quickly, as we have done over the past 18 months and have in the past. Institutionally, this is what we are equipped to do, so I think it would make some sense. The international component of this is very difficult and we think that this will be a multiyear process to get some of these institutions in shape where their resolution could be much more streamlined. One of the things we suggest in my written testimony, it is also suggested in the Administration's white paper, is to require these large institutions to have their own will, so to speak. They need to have their own liquidation plan that they would update, say, on a quarterly basis. The plan would also be facilitated by having greater legal separateness among the functional components. Part of the problem is these functional components are so intertwined, so deposits you may get overseas may be funding assets in the United States. Trying to tease all of that out in an orderly fashion is difficult. So we do think there is some infrastructure that needs to be put in place here. By designating some entity as the resolution authority, it will facilitate international discussions. We are doing that now, but we just have the bank piece of it. I think whoever is designated with the resolution authority would be the entity that could negotiate agreements with other jurisdictions and have systems and agreements in place to deal with situations where an internationally active organization gets into trouble. Protocols would be in place to deal with that situation.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Would expansion of the authority at FDIC to include bank holding companies have allowed you to reach to Lehman Brothers and AIG?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, yes, theoretically it could have. AIG was a thrift holding company. Assuming that you expanded the authorities to both bank and thrift holding companies or the charters were collapsed under Federal Reserve jurisdiction, requiring everybody to become a bank holding company, yes, it would.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","And then where would we stop--or, I guess, is expansion to bank holding companies sufficient? I am thinking we have insurance companies, hedge funds----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Right.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","----private equity firms, mutual funds, pension funds----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","How broadly do we need to reach?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Yes. Well, again----",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","What is the systemic system that we are talking about here?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","We would not want the FDIC to decide that. I think that is something that the Systemic Risk Council really would be best equipped to do. And also, our process does not contemplate that the FDIC would be the authority to decide to close the entity. That could be done a couple of different ways. One would be through the systemic risk process we have now. If it is a holding company, it could be done by the Federal Reserve Board as the primary regulator of the bank holding company. That is the way the process works now. The primary regulator makes the decision to close the institution-- that is frequently done in consultation with us--but then appoints us as a receiver.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Do you think it would be adequate to simply extend jurisdiction to bank holding companies?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","That would be an option if you wanted to do something quickly. As I said before, I am concerned that we are not out of the woods yet, and as the market starts to differentiate between weak and strong and we exit these Government programs, we may be back in the soup. I hope that is not the case, but I am not sure. I think as an interim measure, you could very easily extend our authority to bank holding companies. This approach would not require Congress to address systemic risk or anything else. I think we would still need to do address systemic risk down the road. But yes, this could be a short-term measure. We have drafted language at the request of some of you which would be a very simple amendment process. That would be a very good tool to have now.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","And I assume that you would agree that establishing an expanded resolution authority would help us to get away from the concern that creating a systemic risk regulator for those so-called ``too-large-to-fail'' firms----",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Right.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","----would create an implicit Government guarantee that they would be propped up as opposed to allowed to run down.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","That is right. We want it to be a bad thing, not a good thing, to be systemic. That is exactly right. I think you do that through a robust resolution regime that, as Chairman Schapiro said, makes it clear to the market that this is the process that will be used and shareholders and creditors will take losses.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Well, thank you. My time is up. I would love to have had this same question answered by our other two witnesses. Maybe we will be able to get some----",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Take a minute, Mike. Go ahead.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Could we have the other two witnesses comment on this? Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I really agree with what Sheila has said and am very supportive of that. I guess the only slight amendment I would have would be for bank holding companies that have a broker-dealer subsidiary where customer accounts are protected under the specific law that there be consultation in that process with the SEC, which I fully expect there would be.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, just a couple of comments here. One, I would hope that the universe would actually not expand that greatly. That is, as we have commented before, Chapter 11 is the appropriate route for most entities, financial and nonfinancial. This ought to be a somewhat discrete mechanism which is used only in really unusual circumstances.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. In that context, if we do--I tend to agree with that, as well, but if we do keep this narrowly focused, or as narrow as we are talking here, then I think we really need to face that question of the implicit Government guarantee of the firms that are regulated by the systemic risk regulator or the system we establish.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","And Senator, with respect to bank holding companies, you don't have to reach that question because there is no need to distinguish between the systemically important and nonsystemically important. It is only when you get to the entities that are not currently supervised that you have that issue.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Right.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Mike, very much. Good point.",Speech,
"Senator Merkley","",Speech,
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. One of the components of the President's plan is the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. There hasn't been a lot of discussion of that this morning, so Chair Bair, can you give us a sense of your insights on the role of this potential institution and whether it is an appropriate one to create?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","We support the creation of the agency--an agency that is focused exclusively on consumer protection in financial services that can apply standards across the board for both banks and nonbanks and make sure they are the same standards. We think that would help the banking sector because one of the things that drove the rapid decline in mortgage origination standards was inadequate regulation and supervision outside the banking sector. Most of these very high-risk mortgages were done outside of the traditional banking sector, but as competitive pressure drew market share from banks and thrifts, which also lowered their standards in kind. So I think making sure there are even standards across the board is very important. Where we think the proposal could be strengthened is on its enforcement focus. We strongly recommend that the examination and enforcement component for banks be left with the bank regulators. I say that as a bank regulator but also as an insurer of all institutions with, ultimately, taxpayer exposure with the deposit insurance guarantee. There is a reason why we focus on prudential regulation of banks, as well, and a lot of it is because of FDIC insurance, which is a taxpayer backstop. There are important synergies you can get between prudential and consumer supervision. We typically cross-train our examiners. We can send in teams of both safety and soundness and consumer compliance. A prime example of where joint safety and soundness and compliance examination can be beneficial can be seen in cases where mortgages that were abusive to consumers were also found to be unsafe and unsound. And frequently, we will find where there is a consumer compliance problem that can flag a more fundamental problem with risk management at the institution. We think strongly that the rule writing should be for both banks and nonbanks. We are fine with that. But the examination and enforcement mechanism of a newly formed consumer protection agency should focus outside of the banking sector where you really don't have much examination and enforcement activity at all with the mortgage brokers or payday lenders. There are a lot of abuses outside the banking system that we think could and should be addressed by this agency. But, we really think their focus should be on creating more robust enforcement mechanisms for the nonbank sector. I don't understand why moving all the examiners from the bank regulators to this new agency and then making them responsible for both banks and nonbanks is going to work. I don't think it will. It would be highly disruptive to the FDIC. That is, about 21 percent of our examiners being pulled out of the FDIC. I assume it is a similar percentage for the other regulators. We think we do a good job on examination and enforcement. We have never had the ability to write rules, so that doesn't really change things for us. So we would ask you to consider that change in the Administration's proposal, but we do support the agency.",Speech,
"Senator Merkley","Somewhat related to this, the systemic risk conversation is partly about institutions and it is partly about practices. By practices, I would mention things such as prepayment penalties in mortgage, regulatory arbitrage, whether there is a fundamental conflict of interest in the rating system in which the entity that you are rating is paying for that rating, and the issue of the amounts of leverage that were established in the system under Cox's supervision of the SEC. I am trying to sort out, how does one decide when you have a consumer issue that would be driven by the Consumer Financial Protection Agency? When is it an issue that the systemic risk regulators would take on? And when would it be an issue that the regular bank regulators would take on, and how would it get worked out in terms of how to proceed?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think it does go both ways. What we have suggested in my written testimony, is that bank regulators should be represented on the board of the new consumer agency. Again, as an insurer as well as supervisor, we think the FDIC would have a unique perspective that should be represented. We also would be happy to have the head of these two agencies serve on our board because there are synergies and interconnectedness between prudential supervision and safety and soundness, and I think those need to be dealt with and that would be one way to deal with them. There has always been a separation between rule writing and enforcement for the consumer laws, at least for banks. The Federal Reserve Board has had that authority for federally insured banks. The FDIC and the OCC have never had the ability to write rules. We have just had the examination enforcement component.",Speech,
"Senator Merkley","I want to get in one last question before I run out of time. Paul Volcker had a report that came out in January--I think it was called the ``Group of 30 Report''--that addressed the issue of proprietary trading by banks and essentially using the capital assets of the bank, should banks freely engage in purchasing assets regardless of the risk, and does that create systemic risk, and they had recommendations for constraints on proprietary trading. I open it up to all three of you. Do you have any thoughts about--this hasn't gotten a lot of attention and I am curious of your thinking.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","This probably doesn't surprise you, but as the insurer of banks we would strongly prefer that the proprietary trading occur outside the bank, in an affiliate. If it does occur in a bank holding company that includes an insured depositor institution, that is a risk factor that should be considered in setting assessments if the Congress decides to approve an assessment system for larger institutions.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I would just add that I think proprietary trading with either taxpayers' money in the event of a supported institution or a customer's money does absolutely create risks that we need to be sensitive to. On the broker- dealer side, you are not permitted to proprietary trade with customer funds, and most of that activity takes place outside the regulated broker-dealer.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I would just say that regardless of where these activities are taking place, they can create risk under some circumstances. There needs to be capital, liquidity, and other kinds of regulation which contain the risk no matter where it takes place.",Speech,
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much. Senator Warner . Senator Bennett.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it. And thank you to the witnesses. I think we have covered most of the ground, and I do not necessarily need to rerake the same set of leaves. But I have an overall concern here, and I do not expect a specific answer. I just want to raise it and get some conversation. Systemic risk, what is it? If we do not have a definition of systemic risk that everybody can understand and buy into, we are getting into a messy situation that could end up being just as bad as what we have just come through. I listened to all of this and think, OK, if I were the CEO of one of these companies, and, Sheila, you are saying we want to stigmatize the company if it becomes too-big-to-fail or is showing a systemic risk, the first thing I would say to all of my staff would be, ``Find out what will cause us to cross the threshold of being stigmatized as a Tier 1 `too-big-to-fail' and make sure we manage our business in such a way as to avoid that.'' Now, if the definition of systemic risk is sufficiently loose, we can find ways around the definition, become too-big- to-fail without being defined as ``too-big-to-fail,'' and end up with the board or the single regulator, whoever it is, facing the mess that we have talked about. If the definition is clear and accurate, then the reaction on the part of the CEOs of the company will be, ``We want to avoid being stigmatized,'' and the whole thing will be self- policing. So the market will react to that definition by saying we will not do this and we will not do that and we will not do the other thing. So who gets to decide what is too-big-to-fail? Who gets to define what is a systemic risk? And what should we be looking for as we do that? I guess one last--I have tried to probe into the Lehman Brothers decision because I, with the benefit of hindsight, think the Lehman Brothers decision is probably what triggered the mess that got us into the need for TARP. And digging down through it, I am told ultimately we did not have enough data. When we made the Lehman Brothers decision that said, ``yes, we will allow Lehman to go down,'' we did not have enough data. And if we had had more, we probably would have made the different decision and would have stepped in to try to save Lehman the same way we saved Bear Stearns. So that is a real-life example of what happens when you do not have a clear definition of what is too-big-to-fail. Comments?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, I think you raise really a critical point here, and I think it is one reason I believe the existence of a council will be so important, because making a determination about what is a systemically important institution and how its business practices are evolving over time to move it perhaps in and out of that definition is something a council, a diverse perspective and diverse expertise on different types of financial institutions, I think will be pretty well-suited to do based on an analysis of data, examination reports, information from counterparties and so forth. And so I think for us to be able to determine--I mean, we can come up with a definition of systemically important. It is an institution whose failure puts at risk other institutions or the financial system as a whole. But I do not think it tells us very much because it is, in fact, so general. So I think a council will actually have the ability, and it will have to be an incredibly dynamic process, and that is why I think designating them that way is a mistake, because you will be designated and undesignated. People will structure their business to fall right under the designation. But I think for the primary regulators and the council to understand those institutions that we need to be particularly focused on will be important and facilitated by a council.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","OK. I am glad that Sheila referred earlier about a dollar threshold might be the trigger. An efficiency threshold might be the trigger. An interconnected threshold might be the trigger. There is no single trigger, is what it has come down to.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think your question is going to have importance regardless of whether it is a council, the Fed, a new agency, or somebody else. I think the question you put your finger on matters, no matter who the designator is. And here is the basic dilemma, though, that you all face. As I said a moment ago, with respect to already supervised institutions--bank holding companies--you do not have to draw that sharp line in the sand. You can have an approach to regulation and supervision which is in a sense graduated, squeezing more tightly as there is more interconnectedness, but there is no one place at which you say here is the line. The problem comes with institutions that are currently outside the perimeter of regulation.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Exactly.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","And there, the choices, I think, are several. Basically you have got three choices. Choice one is you say here are the group of institutions which we think under stressed conditions would pose a systemic risk under some set of criteria. Two, here is a set of institutions about which we would not say that with that level of assurance, but it at least would be in the ballpark to think about them in this way. Either of those requires you to draw a line somewhere. The third option, of course, is to say that basically every financial firm, no matter what it calls itself, has to be subject to basic rules and regulations. But that, of course, is itself a change from our current circumstance because we do not have that kind of perimeter. I do not think any of those is a clean choice. There are advantages and disadvantages to each, and that is why I think the question you raised is one that we are going to have to address as best we can no, matter which road people choose to go down.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Sheila, you wanted to comment.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I did. We are suggesting that the resolution authority be applicable to any bank holding company, so for resolution purposes, you would not have to differentiate up front. And whether it was used I think would be a determination made by the primary supervisor about whether to avoid systemic ramifications from a normal bankruptcy process by employing the special resolution process, which still has the same claims priority that bankruptcy has with unsecured creditors and shareholders taking losses before the Government. It is a way that we can plan and use additional powers we have to set up bridge banks or to accept or repudiate contracts. The special powers we have really work better for financial intermediaries. But you do not have to make that determination in advance. I think the dollar threshold I mentioned, in the context of whether there would be an assessment to fund a large institution resolution fund, would really determine who is not systemic as opposed to who is. So for maybe anybody below--pick a number--$25 billion, you can safely assume they are not systemic, so they would not be caught in this assessment. But even those caught in the assessment, the amount of the assessment would be risk based. So if you are a plain vanilla regional bank, you take deposits, you make loans, you do not do much else, you are probably not going to have much of an assessment. If you are a complex bank holding company with a lot of proprietary trading, OTC dealmaking, et cetera, you are probably going to have a higher assessment. As Governor Tarullo said, really the only time where you would need to do it in advance is if there was a large systemically important institution that is not already under consolidated Federal supervision. I do think the council should have the flexibility and authority to define those institutions and bring them under prudential supervision if that is the case. I think that is something the council should do. It would be a tremendous power, and I think it would benefit from the multiplicity of views that would be on the council.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","The power to define becomes ultimately the power that controls everything.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","In terms of institutions, especially if you do away with the thrift charter, there are only a few institutions--I am not going to name any specific institutions--that come to mind that would not already be under Federal prudential supervision. So I am not sure actually if that piece of it in practice would be that profound. As a result of the crisis, pretty much everybody has become a bank holding company or are on their way to doing so. So I am not sure in practical terms that it would be that huge of a change.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Well, I want to thank the panel for hanging in, and I think it is down to Senator Martinez and me for the last two on this, and we have actually a second panel. I have a slew of questions, and I will try to ask them very quickly, again, so that Senator Martinez can get his questions in, and we can respect the second panel if we could try to answer fairly quickly. I strongly, as I made clear, believe that the council is the right approach. I guess I would ask for rather quick responses here--if possible, even kind of yes/no. I would love to--should that council have an independently appointed, Presidential appointment with congressional approval chair? Should it have the ability to look across all financial markets? Should it be able to be the aggregator of data from all of the prudential regulators up to with an independent staff that could aggregate and assess this data? Should it have, as I think we have heard you say, the power to issue rules, require enhanced leverage, or capital rules? And should it be able to force the day-to-day prudential regulators to take action and, if not, have backup authority to take action if the prudential regulator does not? I want to try to--I think Senator Bennett asked very appropriate questions about how we define. I am trying now to get into how we structure if we went forward with this council approach, recognizing that Professor Tarullo may not concur on the----",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","As you know, Senator, the Board at this juncture has a somewhat more contained view of the council, so let me just--you said ``Professor'' before rather than ``Governor,'' and I will slip back into that prior role, which is to say that I think you need to ask yourself at some point whether you are not basically creating a new agency that has brought in all the functions of the other agencies. If you have got a council that basically is able to direct everybody to do what the council thinks you ought to do, it is not that far from the Financial Services Authority mechanism in the U.K. or something like that. Obviously, there are a lot of gradations along the way.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Thank you. Chairman Schapiro and Chairman Bair.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I think you asked five questions, and I think I have five yeses to all of them. I have not thought very carefully through the structure in terms of Presidential appointee confirmed by the Senate, but I think that makes sense. I do believe it needs to have the ability to aggregate data, to look across financial markets and all financial institutions. That is the whole purpose to my way of thinking. And I believe very strongly it needs the power to set capital requirements, leverage limitations, and other prudential regulatory requirements. And I would have, I guess, one caveat on the ability to force prudential regulators to take action if they do not do that, and my view on that would be to raise standards, yes, not to lower standards.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Chairman Bair.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I would say yes.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Thank you. One of the things that Senator Corker has brought before you all a number of times, and I agree with him, is this notion of enhanced resolution authority for the FDIC for bank holding companies. I concur with his approach and that our goal ought to be allowing these institutions to actually fail in an orderly process and not be simply propped up ad infinitum. You know, there are a lot of questions beyond that, and we may even have an interim basis here, but one of the concerns I have with the Administration's proposal is there is still a-- how do you fund that resolution? There is still the idea of having to go to the Treasury or the Fed to get the dollars in the interim and go back and do a retroactive funding of the resolution. And clearly you do not want to have prefund so much from existing small banks. How have you thought about a prefunding mechanism? And how do we make sure that the prefunding, if you do agree with the prefunding, is a large enough net that you are going to capture potentially some of these institutions that may not obviously fall into a current FDIC coverage area?",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","We support a prefunding mechanism, and it is important to note that this fund would be for working capital. This is not an insurance program, so we would not be guaranteeing liabilities as we do with the Deposit Insurance Fund. This would be for working capital to facilitate resolutions where necessary to make sure there are no disruptions to the system. It would take some time to build that fund up, so initially you might have to establish a line of credit with the Treasury Department. This should all be completely separate from the Deposit Insurance Fund and what goes on with insured depository institutions. To the extent we resolved a bank holding company with both banks, and nonbank functions, we would allocate losses to each fund in a way that would keep them completely separate. Similarly, those with the large deposit bases should not be double-assessed, so whatever they are paying into the Deposit Insurance Fund, will take care of what is in the bank. Any other costs would be allocated outside the bank. I do think prefunding is important from the perspective not only of making sure there is something to call upon so you do not have to immediately borrow from taxpayers to facilitate one of these resolutions. But I also think it is a tool that can complement prudential supervision to disincent high-risk behavior. We use risk-based assessments now for deposit insurance. Congress gave us that authority in early 2006. We like some of the impact it has had on behavior, and I think through this assessment system you could do the same types of things. So, for instance, if you did not want to be so extreme as to tell bank holding companies they could not do proprietary trading anymore, maybe you say they can do that in an affiliate, but we are going to charge you a higher assessment. I think it does have a way to impact behavior, but not in a way that you set hard and fast rules or limits that can be arbitraged or may result in unintended consequences.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think this is another one of those areas where you have got downsides as well as upsides whichever way you go. The downside of ex post funding, as has already been suggested, is you have to go back and do an assessment ex post. You have to borrow money from the Treasury in the interim--I certainly hope not the Federal Reserve here--for setting up this mechanism. But if you go the prefunding route, there is not really much experience to know what you are prefunding. As Sheila already said, you are probably not going to be at a point any time in the near future where you would have the fund you would need, so you would need a backup line of authority. And I guess the incentive, or signal, question would have to be asked: If you already have a preset pot of money which is reserved for resolution situations, does that make it more likely that it will be used? And I do not think there is a clear answer to that either.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","I have got another--I am just going to make one quick comment, because I do not want to interfere on Senator Martinez's time. But just as we think about these gradations--and I think, you know, as we think size, I hope there will be some scaling of this as opposed to a simple line that you cross over. The one question I also would want to ask for your answer on, but as we look at bank holding companies taking on a whole series of additional functions that oftentimes look a lot like hedge fund functions, as you mentioned, Chairman Bair, in terms of their internal trading functions, should there be additional capital requirements for these nonbank functions that are taking place inside bank holding companies? And as we look at putting barriers on that ``too-big-to-fail,'' ``too-big-to-fail'' is size and sometimes also a series of additional functions. I will move now to Senator Martinez.",Speech,
"Senator Martinez","Thank you, Senator Warner. I appreciate it very much. I just believe a lot has been covered, and I do not want to again go over ground that has been covered. But there is one area that we have not talked about, and I would like to know the views of all three of you. It has to do with the GSEs, the Government-sponsored enterprises. They are entities that I think define ``too-big-to-fail.'' I think they also were systemically very risky. However, they had this implied Government guarantee that they continue to enjoy. Obviously, we have done a great deal to do what we should have done much earlier, which is put a regulatory scheme in place that might prevent some of the problems in the past. But thinly capitalized, a huge and ever growing market share which even continues to this day, an implied Government guarantee which provided investors a buffer from reality or from the consequences of investments, and I think the whole ball of wax of our mortgage system became very much troubled as a result of their activities and their actions. And I cannot--I think if we were to look back upon this period and what we have been through, I think it would be impossible to overestimate the impact that they have had and all the problems we have seen. How do they fit into what we are talking about here? What is the appropriate place for them to fit? Is there a future that they even should have as Government-sponsored enterprises? Or should they be simply part of the private sector? As I look at each of your functions, they fall under none of you--maybe perhaps a little bit under Chair Schapiro, but not a lot. Exactly. So we are still in the problem. So if we look at what it is that got us where we are today, I would love for us to focus on what got us here rather than just--and, obviously, AIG is a big part of the problem, and, obviously, there are a lot of other, you know, issues and relationships and interconnectedness and all of that. But would you please address the GSEs for me?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Senator, one thing for sure, the guarantee is no longer implicit. It is now----",Speech,
"Senator Martinez","Which, by the way, some would say it never was.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","There is considerable force to that as well. The Board, as you know--long before my arrival there--had expressed concerns about the GSEs, and I do not think anything that has happened in the last 10 months would have reduced those concerns. I guess I would say that there are a number of ways one can go but, going forward, what would be critical is to distinguish private roles from a public role. There is a real public role that can be played by GSEs. That is why they were originally started. But when you have a public role, that is when guarantees, implicit or explicit, are going to be involved. And that is when you are trying to implement a set of policies, so those activities are going to have to be constrained, and you are going to have to make sure that the entity is really functioning as a public entity under a certain obvious set of constraints. My characterization of some of the GSEs over the last 10 years would be that nobody could tell where the public ended and the private began.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","I would just add that the Federal Reserve Board was an early sounder of risk. And at Treasury, especially when I was at Treasury, similarly, we tried to sound the alarms. I think, though, one of the advantages of----",Speech,
"Senator Martinez","I will speak up for HUD as well.",Speech,
"Ms. Bair","Absolutely. A lot of people. I think this council would be able to give voice to those concerns and have real authority to address them. I think that is one of the advantages of the council. I think the Administration proposal would put the FHFA on the council. And if you continue with these GSEs--I do not know what their future is, but if they continue--they clearly still represent tremendous systemic exposure. So I think this would be a prime area where in the past you would have had a mechanism where we could have forced some real action through this council. Going forward, if the GSEs continue to function this way, the regulators should be represented as well.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I do not have much to add, although let me stand up for the SEC, long before I arrived, in their push for public reporting by the GSEs. I do think Dan makes an excellent point about distinguishing the public and private roles and attendant consequences of having that public policy mission. It needs to be, I think, very transparent and well-understood by the marketplace.",Speech,
"Senator Martinez","Well, I think the market, you know, when you put paper in the market and people invest, I do not know how that is ever a public role, really. I am not sure you can have private investors and a board of directors that is then beholden to the investors or to their public role. And that is my trouble with the whole idea of the GSEs the way they are chartered. So I think I for one would wonder how their future should really be and whether, in fact, they still have a role that ought to be as it has been in the past. Or should we very dramatically alter that going forward? Thank you for your input, and thank you for being here this morning.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Senator Menendez.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony. Let me ask, you know, for those of us who are struggling to define what the boundaries of systemic risk are, which is, I think, one of the key questions--and I know you have been asked some of these, and you have given some answers. But to me, it is more complicated than just the size of a firm or what business it is in, but how significant its activities are as well as how extensive its relationships are with other firms and consumers. So we have used very often ``too-big-to-fail.'' Sometimes I wonder whether we should be looking at too interconnected to fail. And in that respect, you know, should, for example, extensive relationships with small business and consumers count in defining systemic risk? By way of example, CIT. CIT is the largest lender to small businesses in America and has been in financial difficulties. It seems to me that unless an entity like that can find its way out of its financial difficulties, we are talking about hundreds of thousands of small businesses across the Nation who will not have the type of financing they need to conduct their activities, which is the greatest creator of jobs in the country at a time in which the country is desperately in need of jobs. So how do we look, for example, at that? Is that an element of systemic risk? If it is, then define it for me a little better. If it is not, tell me why it is not.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","So I will start, Senator. I do not think any of us probably wants to be speaking with reference to any particular entity, so let me just try to speak in more abstract terms. I think we do need to draw a distinction between entities that are economically significant and entities that pose systemic financial risk. There are many entities in this country whose failure would have very adverse economic consequences on a lot of people who deal with them--a lot of employees, communities, suppliers, and the like--but that do not create systemic financial risk in the sense that their failure leads to a kind of immediate cascading effect, in which leverage that is consecutively held by a lot of institutions that have counterparty relationships with one another suddenly becomes a problem. As asset values deteriorate and margin calls increase, you have to put up more collateral or you have to sell assets because you do not have enough collateral to put up. That is the pattern that we saw with Bear, Lehman, and AIG, and, in fact, you can go back 11 years and say that is the pattern you saw with Long Term Capital Management.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","So a cascading of thousands of businesses that would not have access to capital would not be a systemic risk?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","It would be a very severe economic problem, but the reason I would say it would not be a systemic financial risk is that it does not unwind essentially overnight or----",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","So the automobile industry would fall in the same context as you are describing.",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","I think the judgment on the automobile industry was that, again, there were truly enormous costs, particularly in a situation in which the economy was headed down so quickly anyway, and I gather that is why the Administration and many Members of Congress thought that action should be taken. But it did not pose a systemic financial risk even though it did impose substantial financial hardship. I do not think any of us wants to tell you that an approach to systemic risk will either prevent or mitigate all important economic----",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","So let me take a different--I do not know if any of you want to jump in to that question, but let me take a different tack on that. So we are looking at a $3, $4 trillion commercial mortgage problem coming down the pike in a marketplace that at this point in time I am told by entities across the country there is no--largely speaking, in the private sector there is not the wherewithal for that market to take these mortgages that will be rolling over. Now, having looked at our lack of action on the homeownership sign and what happened there, is that something that we think poses systemic risk? Or do you put it under your same category, may create enormous economic consequences but obviously does not have financial risk? Although I would say that if all those people default and cannot find a mortgage in the marketplace, those institutions will be holding a large number--maybe backed up by some degree of security with the properties, but they will have large numbers of defaults and less under a marketplace that has reduced in value and less than their holdings presently require. So what is that?",Speech,
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think it depends, Senator, again, on where the concentration is to be found and what the impact of the failure of an institution holding any form of exposure would be. Let me just say with respect to commercial real estate, I agree with your assessment that it is a looming problem. It is a looming problem for communities and for economic performance generally. It is a looming problem for many financial institutions in this country. I do not know that one can classify it in and of itself as being a systemic risk or not being a systemic risk. It is surely an issue and a problem, which is why I think all the bank supervisors have been paying attention to the exposures. And now speaking only for the Fed, we extended the TALF program to commercial mortgages precisely because of the absence of credit flows and the absence of secondary markets there.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, I would just add briefly that I think there are--your question really points out something very important. We are very focused on systemically important institutions, but there are absolutely systemically risky practices that, if engaged in by a broad range of institutions, no one of which might be a systemically important institution, but those practices taken together across the marketplace as a whole absolutely have the potential to create broad systemic risk for the financial system at large.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","My time is up, but I will submit a question to you, Chairman Bair, about your FDIC-OCC dispute on big banks versus community banks, because I just do not quite understand that community banks that were not the cause of the challenges we face get hit at the same rate as entities that did create some of those risks and that have greater risk overall. So I do not quite get it, but I would love to hear the answer.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Senator Menendez, and I would like to thank the panel. You have hung in for a long time and we will, I know, have additional questions which we will submit to you. Thank you all. If we could go ahead and move to the second panel, and my thanks to the second panel's forbearance. If the second panel could move quickly to their seats so that we could move forward, I think we do have a vote, as I understand, coming up in the next 45 minutes, so we want to make sure folks get a chance to testify. I am going to go ahead and introduce our panel, even though they are in the midst of still being seated. Vincent Reinhart has spent more than two decades working on domestic and international aspects of U.S. monetary policy. He served for the last 6 years of his Federal Reserve career as Secretary and Economist to the Federal Open Market Committee and has served in a variety of senior positions at the Federal Reserve. Mr. Reinhart, thank you for being here. Paul Schott Stevens has served as President and Chief Executive Officer of the Investment Company Institute since June 2004. Outside ICI, Mr. Stevens' career has included varied roles in private law practices, corporate counsel, and in Government service. Mr. Stevens, thank you for being here, as well. Alice Rivlin, as we all know, is the Senior Fellow in Economic Studies Programs at Brookings. She was the Founding Director of the CBO and has served as Director of the White House Office of Management and Budget. Alice, thank you for appearing here, as well. Allan Meltzer is a Professor of Political Economy and Public Policy at the Carnegie Mellon University and is also a visiting scholar at AEI. I don't normally get a chance to sit here in the chair. I don't want to mess it up too much, but recognizing that Senator Bunning said we actually may have a series of votes starting even earlier than 45 minutes from now, I would ask each of the panel, recognizing there are only three of us here still on this side of the dais, if they could make their statements relatively short so that we could make sure we could get a chance to ask questions.",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","Thank you for the opportunity to testify today, even if it is late in the session. No doubt, the American people expect significant remedial action in the aftermath of the extraordinary Government support to financial institutions over the past year. In my view, the Congress should form a committee of existing supervisors headed by an independent director, appointed by the President, and confirmed by the Senate. The director should have a budget for staff and real powers to compel cooperation among the constituent agencies and reporting from unregulated entities, if necessary. The constituent agencies should regularly be directed to draft reports in their areas of expertise for consideration by the full committee and transmittal to the Congress. This could include twice-a-year reports on financial stability from the Fed, appraisals of the health of the banking system from the FDIC, and assessments of the resilience of markets from the CFTC and the SEC. I believe there are compelling reasons that the responsibility of the financial stability supervisor should not be given to the Fed. I worked in the Federal Reserve system for a quarter century and hold its staff in high esteem. But any group of people in an independent agency given too many goals will be pulled in too many directions. And there is one goal given to the Fed that should not be jeopardized, the pursuit of maximum employment and stable prices. Indeed, that goal is so pivotal that Congress should be thinking of narrowing, not broadening, the Fed's focus. A financial stability committee could foster the achievement over time for robust rules on the resolution of private firms, simplification of the financial system, and consolidation of financial agencies. That is the opportunity for real, long-lasting benefits.",Statement,STATEMENT OF VINCENT R. REINHART, RESIDENT SCHOLAR, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Reinhart.",Speech,
"Mr. Stevens","Thank you, Senator Warner, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee. You may recall I testified before the Committee in March and recommended at that time that the best way to approach systemic risk regulation would be to create a statutory council of senior Federal regulators. Such a body would be best equipped to look across the system and anticipate and address emerging threats to its stability. As I thought about the challenge, I told the Committee that my model was the National Security Council, which Congress established in 1947 to coordinate and integrate, quote, ``domestic foreign and military policies relating to the national security.'' From 1987 to 1989, I served on the NSC staff. I was its first legal advisor. I helped lead a reorganization of the NSC, of the system and of its staff, and I then served as Chief of the NSC staff under National Security Advisor Colin Powell. Based on that experience, I believe an interagency council with a strong authority in a focused area, in this case monitoring and directing the response to risks that threaten overall financial stability, could, like the NSC, serve the Nation well in addressing complex and multifaceted risks. The Administration has proposed creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council, but one that would have at best an advisory or consultative role. The lion's share of systemic risk authority would be vested in the Fed, and that approach strikes me as achieving the wrong balance. Most importantly, it fails to make meaningful use of the expertise and viewpoints of other regulators and it represents, as some Members of the Committee have observed, a very worrisome expansion of the Federal Reserve's authority over the Nation's entire financial system. I would note my reading of the Administration's legislative proposals would, for example, suggest that dozens of mutual fund companies could conceivably be under scrutiny as Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies, a result that was, to say the least, surprising to me. I would urge Congress instead to create a strong Systemic Risk Council, one with teeth. Effectively addressing risk to the financial system at large requires diverse inputs and perspectives. The standing membership of the council should include the core Federal regulators, within my judgment, the Treasury Secretary serving as Chair. For independence, the council should be supported by a very strong Executive Director appointed by the President and a small, highly experienced staff. For accountability, the council should be required to report regularly on its activities to the Congress. By statute, the council should be charged with identifying risks and directing regulatory actions needed to mitigate them. Responsibility for addressing the risks should lie with the functional regulators, operating for this purpose only under the council's direction. The council would thus have clear authority, but over a very limited range of issues, only major unaddressed hazards, not day-to-day regulation. This approach has several advantages. The council would enlist expertise across the spectrum of financial services. It would be well-suited to balancing competing interests. It would engage the functional regulators as full partners. At the same time, its independent staff could serve as a check on the functional regulators and avoid the regulatory capture that could result if one agency were set over all institutions deemed systemically risky or too-big-to-fail. And the council could be up and running quickly, while it might take years for any existing agency to assemble the requisite skills to oversee all areas of the financial system. Critics of the model have said that convening a committee is not the best way to put out a fire, and that may be, but the goal of systemic risk regulation should be to prevent or contain fires before they consume our financial system, and a broad-based council surely is the very best body for designing a strong fire code. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I look forward to your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF PAUL SCHOTT STEVENS, PRESIDENT AND CEO, INVESTMENT COMPANY INSTITUTE
"Senator Warner","Thank you for both getting your statements in under your time. Ms. Rivlin, the Chairman is back. Let us see if we can keep this, you know, if I can show off a little bit to show that everybody gets through their statements quickly.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","We are on a roll here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee. Controlling systemic risk breaks into two questions, I think, how to avoid the excesses of a bubble economy that can burst and cause a catastrophic downward spiral, and second, how to make sure that if a large interconnected institution fails, it doesn't start that downward spiral and take others with it. On the first question, how to prevent the excesses of a bubble, we need to fix regulatory gaps. Ineffective regulation contributed to the excesses and allowed lax lending standards and all of the things that we have worried about. And we need to correct the perverse incentives that crept into the system, as with the originate-to-distribute model. That can be done, correcting the gaps and perverse incentives, but however we do that, the job is not over. Participants in the financial system will try to avoid the rules, whatever they are. The system will need constant monitoring to make sure that new gaps and perverse incentives are not creeping in that lead to new excesses and instability. So I think one job is this monitoring function. The Obama Administration would put this function with a Financial Oversight Council chaired by the Treasury but with its own staff. I think it would make more sense to put this function at the Federal Reserve, perhaps consulting with a council. The Fed has the clear overview of the whole economy. It fits with the job that they already have for monitoring the economy and the health of the banking system. I would also give the Fed another tool, broader control of the amount of leverage in the system. Bubbles get out of hand when demand is fueled by big increases in speculation with other people's money. The short-term interest rate is not a sufficient tool for controlling as that price bubbles. So I would recommend working out a system in which not only capital requirements, but other constraints on leverage across the system could be tightened in the face of a serious bubble threat. Then there is the problem of the large interconnected institution. This can be mitigated by making it more expensive to get big, having capital requirements rise as institutions grow, for instance. We need much more effective prudential regulation of all financial institutions, especially as they get big enough to threaten the system. The Obama Administration proposes designating institutions that pose systemic risk and giving the Fed responsibility for consolidated prudential regulation of what they call Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies. I think both parts of that proposition would be a mistake. We should not designate institutions as too-big-to-fail and give them their own regulator. It is hard to make up that list. But we would also be creating a new set of GSEs. There is a danger that the regulator of too-big-to-fail institutions would see its job as keeping them from failing and the result would eventually be expensive bailouts. Second, I would definitely not put additional regulatory responsibility at the Federal Reserve. The Fed is very good at monetary policy. It should be headed and staffed by strong macroeconomists who are charged with keeping on top of economic developments. These are different skills from regulation and I think putting an additional regulatory responsibility which they have historically not been very good at at the Fed would dilute their monetary policy focus. I also fear that adding a new set of regulatory authorities to the Fed's task would threaten the independence of monetary policy, which is very important to preserve. Congress would justifiably want more control over such a powerful agency, appropriations, accountability for policy, and so forth. It might easily threaten the independence of the Federal Reserve in taking unpopular decisions to rein in the bubble economy. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ALICE M. RIVLIN, SENIOR FELLOW, ECONOMIC STUDIES, BROOKINGS INSTITUTION
"Senator Warner","Professor Meltzer.",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, thank you for the opportunity to be here. I believe that effective regulation should await evidence and conclusions about the causes of the recent crisis. There are so many assertions about those causes that Congress should want to avoid a rush to regulate. During much of the past 15 years, I have written three volumes entitled The History of the Federal Reserve. Working with several assistants, we have read virtually all of the minutes of the Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee, the Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, staff papers, internal memos, and so on. I speak from that perspective. I speak also from experience in Japan, where I served as the honorary advisor to the Bank of Japan during the 1990s when they were undergoing their banking and financial crisis. First, I do not know of any clear examples in the history of the Federal Reserve in which the Federal Reserve acted in advance of a crisis or a series of banking and financial failures. I have had the privilege of working with various Secretaries of the Treasury. Here is how the problem presents itself to them. There are a group of people who say, if you don't do the bailout now, you are going to have a crisis and it will go down in the history books with your name on it. There will be a few people who will say--very few, I may say--who will say, let the failing institution fail and make sure that you protect the market from having the failure spread. That is a question that really is at the center of this. It is not whether we should get rid of ``too-big-to-fail.'' I think many people recognize that ``too-big-to-fail'' is a disaster. What we need to worry about is how do we prevent problems from spreading. I am pleased to see that there is a good deal of skepticism among the Members of the Committee about simply appointing another regulator and saying to them, do what Secretaries of the Treasury, Chairmen of the Federal Reserve have done historically. That won't work. There are three things which I think are central to any such discussion. First is the question of incentives. How do we make incentives for prudent behavior on the part of bankers? We let them fail. Second, how do we make sure that bankers will not want to fail? We tell them you can fail and the best way to avoid failure is to hold capital. We need to buildup the capital. In the 1920s, banks everywhere had much more capital than they do now. A bank's window said, some of you may remember, listed the paid-in surplus and capital. By the 1950s, that was gone and it said, ``Member FDIC.'' That was a change in attitude. So we need to worry about capital. And last but something that I have not heard here but which should be part of your discussion is we need a lender of last resort proposal. The Federal Reserve in 96 years has never clearly enunciated what its role as lender of last resort is. It must be a role that the Congress will accept. No role will be viable if the Congress doesn't accept it. But there must be such a rule and that rule should say, hold capital and hold negotiable assets that you can sell to the Federal Reserve at the discount window what they will accept. That is the way in which we keep crises from spreading. We say, you are responsible as a banker and you must hold capital to protect yourself and you must have negotiable assets that you can sell to the Federal Reserve discount window because that is what it is there for. Without that, we won't have safety. What difference will there be if we establish one of these super-regulators? Why will they behave differently than the Treasury Secretaries that I have talked about, Federal Reserve Chairmen? Why will they not say about the Tier 1 risk people, you are too-big-to-fail. We can't allow that to happen. We have to use taxpayer money to bail you out. I don't believe that it will work. The first law of regulation--my first law of regulation is regulators make rules. Markets learn to circumvent them. You have heard lots of examples of that. It is a dynamic process. There is no set of rules which is going to for all time regulate this process. We need to change the incentives and the incentives have to be, you fail, we protect the market.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ALLAN H. MELTZER, PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, TEPPER SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY
"Senator Warner","Thank you all for your testimony. Thank you for your abbreviated testimony. If I ever get a chance to sit here again, I am not going to go first, Chairman Dodd. Chairman Dodd . He has got a future in the Senate, I would say.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Mark, very much, and thanks for chairing the Committee for a few minutes. Well, thank all of you. What a wealth of talent at this table and a wealth of experience, as well. You really offer some very great counsel and advice to us as we try to navigate these waters. I think all of us, as I said earlier, are very conscious of the fact that this is a tremendous challenge and we want to get it right. I think you have heard a number of us make the point that, unlike other efforts ongoing today, this is one that is almost devoid of ideology as we are looking at it and how do we do this in a way that is going to provide the kind of confidence- building measures that are so critical for the stability of our financial institutions, and that word ``confidence'' more than anything else is one that--I don't know of any specific formula that gets you there. It is one of those items that you know it when you have it and you know it when you don't, and trying to create through this process, even the process itself we are going through, I hope has some confidence-building qualities to it, as the Committee of primary jurisdiction over these matters to what steps do we take in order to reestablish that level of confidence. On the part of all the consumers and users of financial services, from the shareholder to the borrower to the depositor to the policy holder, all of whom have different assumptions of risk as they engage in financial activities, but essential in all of them, weaving its way through each one of them is confidence--confidence the system is going to work, that it is going to be there to protect them, that they are going to be safe, not that they necessarily have a guaranteed return on the activities they engage in, but the system won't fail them. They may make a bad bet, but it is not because the system was corrupt or fell apart on them. And so that is really, I think, what we are all trying to achieve in this. Senator Shelby chaired this Committee and has a strong understanding and sense of it. People like Mark Warner and Jim Bunning, Mark has had a great background and experience in this in his private life, and Jim Bunning was ahead of the curve on this Committee, working with others on the Committee, identifying very early on the issue of the residential mortgages. So there has been a lot of history on the Committee going back, so we are appreciative of it. And let me start with a question you have somewhat addressed already. The Fed has long argued that its prudential supervisory regulatory powers over banks and holding companies are critical to the effectiveness of its monetary policy, that they are interrelated, and three out of the four of you have experience at the Fed. Given your own past roles in setting and executing monetary policy at the Fed, we would like to hear your views on this. This idea that you can separate and distinguish in those roles is one that really is not wise. And a follow-up, Dr. Meltzer. Based on your study of the Federal Reserve's history, do you see the Fed's bank supervisory role as critical to its monetary policy function, as well----",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","No, sir, and the staff has told them many times the answer is it really is unrelated. I mean, they can get the information from the other agencies. The reason the Fed, I believe, the reason the Fed wants supervisory authority is because it wants a coalition of people to protect themselves against pressures that come from the Administration and Congress. It wants people who know about the Fed, that want to protect its monetary policy responsibilities and they have used it in that way. At one time in the history, the Committee, your Committee-- not you, but your Committee got very angry at Chairman Burns because of the extent to which he had used that mechanism to protect himself against something that the Congress wanted to do.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Alice.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","I don't think that the supervising individual banks is important to making monetary policy. I know that was said around the table when I was at the Fed, but I didn't really experience that we learned a lot from the supervising particular banking institutions that was useful to monetary policy. What is important is for the Fed to have access to information about how things are going and that is why I think the monitoring function of being in charge of monitoring for systemic risk is--they ought to be doing that anyway, but to give them that formal responsibility, I think, would be helpful. But I don't think they have to supervise individual institutions. In fact, I think it would be bad to do that.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Let me ask you this, Alice, and the question has been raised with others and you may have addressed it before I walked back in in your statements, and that is the potential conflict. Given the principal function and responsibility of the Fed of monetary policy--and I don't think anyone disagrees, that is the primary responsibility--is there not the risk of being in conflict from time to time when you are asked to be both simultaneously the systemic risk regulator and functioning as the fundamental, chief responsibility of monetary policy, where you could actually--you are letting one trump the other. There are not necessarily going to be consistent objectives at given moments in time.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","That could be true. I think the more important point, though, is that they are different skills. If you really want a set of people who are good at regulating institutions and helping them not make stupid decisions, then it is a different kind of staff and leadership than the people who are good at macroeconomics and figuring out what to do about the economy.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Mr. Reinhart, do you have a view on this?",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","Sure, a couple points. One is when you give an entity that has macropowers a supervisory responsibility, they have the ability to clean up their mistakes after the fact. Would a Fed that can lend to an institution be more willing to lend to it when it hadn't identified it as a systemic threat? Would it be willing to use its monetary policy tool to make markets function better in an environment where it had failed to identify some market areas as posing systemic risk? Now, for 6 years, I signed off on the minutes and transcripts of the Federal Open Market Committee, a wonderful resource actually giving the details of deliberations of monetary policy. And the next time you hear someone say there is important cross-pollination between monetary policy decisions and bank supervision, you should ask them to go back to the FOMC transcripts and give you the examples where there was a significant discussion about bank supervisory matters that informed the monetary policy decision. The fact is, as has already been noted, an agency is filled with hardened silos and the economists don't talk to the lawyers who don't talk to the bank supervisors. What is important is to enforce an information sharing, and in some ways, it is easier to do that across agencies than within an agency.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Paul, I want to give you a quick chance to respond to that. My time is up, but it is good to see you and thanks for being here.",Speech,
"Mr. Stevens","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Lacking the experience that my colleagues have at the Fed, I will pass on that question.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","All right.",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","Mr. Chairman, may I just say, Congress passed FDICIA to try to prevent exactly what you just described. They have not used FDICIA.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Good point.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Dr. Reinhart, you were the Director, it is my understanding, of the Division of Monetary Policy at the Fed.",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","And from what I gather from your testimony, you do not believe the Fed needs to regulate financial institutions in order to conduct or perform its monetary policy functions, do you, or do you not?",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","Yes. I think the Fed needs an understanding, a deep understanding of the ways markets work, about the way the institutions work in general. They need to share information from other agencies. But the talents to be able to tell a macrostory to fit all those parts of the picture together for the implications for policy are not ones that need supervision.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Dr. Meltzer, in your testimony, you question the wisdom of relying too much on capital standards to guard against systemic risk. You point out the problems of the Basel Accord that they caused. You also note that banks have been very successful in circumventing regulation, which we see. My question to you, are there limits on how much Congress can manage systemic risk through regulation, and if so, what measures can be adopted to create incentives for the private sector to better manage risk?",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","Two critical things. Get rid of ``too-big-to- fail'' and replace it with more capital in the banks. Second, get a lender of last resort rule that you are willing to live with, that the Fed is willing to live with, that the regulators are willing to live with, which says institutions can fail. The market will be protected from the spread of that failure to other institutions. Without those changes, no regulation is going to work. I gave this talk at the council on Foreign Relations and I said, lawyers make regulations. Markets learn to circumvent them. The first question was from a lawyer. He said, it is we lawyers who teach them how to circumvent them.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","You have got it right. Doctor, in your examination of history, has the Federal Reserve demonstrated that it is inherently better at identifying systemic risk than any other regulator?",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","It is hard to identify systemic risk. You know, the term ``systemic risk'' is a term of art. I mean, it is indeed a term of art, because as the questions on the Committee showed earlier, every Congressman, every Senator will see--properly see--a failing institution in his region as a problem which is systemic. How are they going to fight that? I mean, you, Senator, along with many people argued against the GSEs----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","That is right.",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","----thought that something had to be done. But Congress wasn't going to do that. Is a systemic regulator going to say, ignore Congress and do that? Is that what we want? No. Is it possible? I don't believe it is possible in the American system of Government, nor do I think it should be possible in the American system of Government for people to say the Congress doesn't have a right even to make the mistakes that it makes.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Ms. Rivlin, the Fed's wide-ranging responsibilities seem to me to appear at times to distract it from its primary mission of monetary policy. For example, just the other day, the topics covered at our recent Humphrey- Hawkins hearing demonstrate this point. While the discussion should have centered on monetary policy, by our count, only about 27 percent of the questions even addressed monetary policy from this Committee. How concerned are you that we may be asking one institution to do too much?",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","I am very concerned, Senator Shelby, and that is why I don't think it is a good idea to have a new responsibility for ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions at the Fed or indeed to identify those institutions at all. I am not sure that the Humphrey-Hawkins questioning, since we are in the middle of a catastrophe and there were all sorts of things to ask about, is exactly an example of that, but I do fear that we will distract the Fed from monetary policy.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Warner . Senator Reed.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your testimony today and for your answers. As the President's plan evolves, if it is not modified, the Federal Reserve essentially would be the direct regulator of most of the major financial institutions of the country. It would eliminate OTS, et cetera. There has been the suggestion here, or at least the recommendation, that they get out of the business of regulating banks. But then I would presume they would still have the authority, in fact, the responsibility to regulate the holding company structure, the subsidiaries, the affiliates where a lot of the problems really evolved. Is that your sense, Mr. Reinhart?",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","That is why actually I would be a strong proponent of simplification of the rules, consolidation of the agencies, and putting in place a forceful resolution mechanism for entities. So my preference would be to roll in the existing agencies, including the supervisory part of the Federal Reserve for holding companies, into a new Federal regulator.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Mr. Stevens, do you have an opinion?",Speech,
"Mr. Stevens","Yes. Thank you, Senator. I had an occasion to look through, at least briefly, the Administration's legislative language and the entities that would be vetted to determine whether they are Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies, at least potentially, represent an enormous universe of firms-- $10 billion or more in assets, $100 billion or more in assets under management, $2 billion or more in gross annual revenue. All of those firms would be potentially subject to review for whether they should be designated Tier 1 Financial Holding Companies under a series of standards, the last of which is any other factor that the Fed thinks is important. So I don't know, reading the legislation, what the universe of Fed-regulated entities will be, but it is potentially enormously large. I asked our research department, how many mutual fund firms are there, through their mutual funds or other asset management activities, that may have $100 billion or more in assets under management, and as I said in my statement, our best guess is that there are dozens of them, many of whom would be quite surprised to learn that they are systemically risky, none of whom thinks that they are too-big- to-fail.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Dr. Rivlin.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","I would go with Mr. Reinhart on this. Moving to a consolidated regulator with less potential for regulatory arbitrage would seem to me fine, and moving the regulation of bank holding companies out of the Fed would also seem to me fine. But the real point is, don't make it worse. Don't put a huge new regulatory responsibility at the Federal Reserve.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","And Dr. Meltzer.",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","Senator, I don't have any quarrel with Vince Reinhart's proposal. I would say that if you look around the world, we have separation of regulation and monetary policy. We have it together. It doesn't seem to make a great deal of difference. That is, for the failures that we have, why is that? Because we lack the incentives on the regulators to close down ``too-big-to-fail'' and protect the market.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","And your proposal is, I think, a very direct response to that, which would be to have higher capital levels which presumably smaller institutions could result or would result from that. One other question, because it is implicit, I think, in what we are talking about in terms of dealing with derivatives, et cetera, and that is establishing capital ratios for risky operations. Can you comment on that approach, too?",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","Yes. I would say, let the institution choose its size, but increase the capital requirement more than proportional to the size of the assets so that we--the reason I want that is I want the stockholders and the management to bear the losses. There is no gain in economies of scale and economies of scope that the public is going to realize from large institutions that compensates for the costs we just paid. So we want the costs to be on them, and that gives them an incentive not to do the things they have been doing.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","A vote has started and----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I am going to be very short. I have got one question, because I have waited for this panel a long time.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","This is for anybody that would like to answer. Do you think the Federal Reserve would do a better job at monetary policy if its only mission was keeping a stable currency?",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","I will start with that. I believe--I like the dual requirement. I think that represents what all central banks, whatever their requirements are, all central banks have to be concerned about what is happening to the public. But they also need to have much more attention on maintaining price stability. I think the Committee needs to say, we are going to require the Federal Reserve to adopt some principle by which they operate that limits their discretion to make the mistakes that they have been making.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, because they don't pay any attention to us. Go ahead.",Speech,
"Mr. Meltzer","They do it if it is in the law.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, even if we write it into the law, they don't do it, because in 1994, we wrote it into the law that they monitor all mortgages within the banking system that they control and within the mortgage brokers. And for 14 years, they didn't write a regulation. Alice.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","I would actually keep the dual focus on employment, as well as inflation.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","And I think the Fed gets pretty high marks, actually, on the inflation front, as do other central banks over the last few years.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Depending on who is scoring.",Speech,
"Ms. Rivlin","Well, OK, but we have not had a big inflation problem. Now, maybe the Fed doesn't get all the credit for it, but it is not that they haven't paid attention on that front. They may not have paid attention----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Oh, I didn't say they didn't pay attention, but they failed to act is all I can tell you. Go ahead.",Speech,
"Mr. Stevens","Senator, all I would say, not being the Fed expert here, is----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","You don't have to be a Fed expert to understand.",Speech,
"Mr. Stevens","----at least there is a strong question to ask--why the authority should be so dramatically expanded.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK.",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","I believe the Fed Reserve would be better off if it had a narrow mandate. Maximum employment and stable prices sounds right to me. I think are many reasons why that would be better, including keeping the focus of the institution, also providing----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Rather than expanding their portfolio.",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","Certainly not expanding. Also making it clearer to the public exactly what the Federal Reserve does and improving the relationships with the Congress.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That would take a lot of work.",Speech,
"Mr. Reinhart","If it was narrowly focused. When you think about it, a lot of these hearings get consumed by issues other than monetary policy.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","When they came to us, when they asked for the TARP money and said, this is going to be as transparent as anything that we have ever dealt with, and they have completely stonewalled who they lent the money to, how much money they printed, and what banks got it and what they spent it for. So transparency is out the door. Thank you for your answers. Thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Warner","Well, I am not going to get a chance to ask my questions. That is the last time I will take this middle position here as the temporary Chair. But just two quick comments because we are going to have to run off and vote. One, thank you all very much for your testimony this morning. My apologies that the session started late. We will, I am sure, all have additional questions. I share the overwhelming view of the panel that systemic risk ought to not be placed with the Fed and ought to be empowered with a new independent council that includes the Fed. I also would like to hear a longer--a written question I will submit. I do believe we ought to further explore the idea of a single end-to-end depository regulator for all prudential regulation and take that out of the Fed and out of the FDIC as well as the consolidation of the OCC and OTS. And I do share Professor Meltzer's concerns about how we put stumbling blocks in front of ``too-big-to-fail.'' Increased capital, obviously one. I think we have to look at increased capital on resolution and whether even a contingent liability fund inside firms of ``too-large'' that might actually cause some self-policing among those institutions. The question I will also submit to you is whether those nontraditional banking activities, as more and more of these large bank holding companies look like hedge funds, look like trading funds, have all these other nontraditional banking aspects, should there be higher capital requirements on those what would be arguably riskier activities. But I will submit those as questions and look forward to your answers. I again thank the panel for their patience and indulgence. Thank you all very much. The hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
