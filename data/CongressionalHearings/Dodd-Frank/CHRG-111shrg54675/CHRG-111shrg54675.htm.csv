"Mr. Hopkins","Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you very much for the opportunity to provide you with the community bank perspective on the impact of the credit crisis in rural areas. My name is Jack Hopkins, and I am President and CEO of CorTrust Bank in Sioux Falls, South Dakota. I am testifying on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America, and I serve on the ICBA's Executive Committee. I am a past President of the Independent Community Bankers of South Dakota and have been a banker in South Dakota for 25 years. CorTrust Bank is a national bank with 24 locations in 16 South Dakota communities and assets of $550 million. Eleven of the communities we serve have fewer than 2,000 people. In seven of those communities, we are the only financial institution. The smallest community has a population of 122 people. Approximately 20 percent of our loan portfolio is agricultural lending to businesses that rely heavily on the agricultural economy. CorTrust Bank is also one of the leading South Dakota lenders for the USDA's Rural Housing Service home loan program. Mr. Chairman, as we have often stated before this Committee, community banks played no part in causing the financial crisis fueled by exotic lending products, subprime loans, and complex and highly leveraged investments. However, rural areas have not been immune from rising unemployment, tightening credit markets, and the decline in home prices. We believe that, although the current financial crisis is impacting all financial institutions, most community banks are well positioned to overcome new challenges, take advantage of new opportunities, and reclaim some of the deposits lost to larger institutions over the last decade. A recent Aite study shows that even though some community banks are faced with new lending challenges, they are still lending, especially when compared to larger banks. In fact, while the largest banks saw a 3.23-percent decrease in 2008 net loans and leases, institutions with less than $1 billion in assets experienced a 5.53-percent growth. Mr. Chairman, small businesses are the lifeblood of rural communities. We believe small businesses will help lead us out of the recession and boost needed job growth. Therefore, it is vitally important to focus on the policy needs of the small business sector during this economic downturn. As I mentioned earlier, most of my commercial lending is to small businesses dependent on agriculture. The Small Business Administration programs are an important component of community bank lending. SBA must remain a viable and robust tool in supplying small business credit. The frozen secondary market for small business loans continues to impede the flow of credit to small business. Although several programs have been launched to help unfreeze the frozen secondary market for pools of SBA-guaranteed loans, including the new Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility-- TALF and a new SBA secondary market facility, they have yet to be successful due to the program design flaws and unworkable fees. ICBA recommends expanding these programs to allow their full and considerable potential. Several of my colleagues have told us about the mixed messages they received from bank examiners and from policy makers regarding lending. Field examiners have created a very harsh environment that is killing lending as examiners criticize and require banks to write down existing loans, resulting in capital losses. Yet policy makers are encouraging lending from every corner. Some bankers are concerned that regulators will second- guess their desire to make additional loans, and others are under pressure from their regulators to decrease their loan-to- deposit ratios and increase capital levels. Generally, the bankers' conclusions are that ample credit is available for creditworthy borrowers. They would like to make more loans, and they are concerned about the heavy-handedness from the regulators. Finally, Mr. Chairman, community bankers are looking closely at the regulatory reform proposals. ICBA supports the administration's proposal to prevent too-big-to-fail banks or nonbanks from ever threatening the collapse of the financial system again. Community banks support the dual system of State and Federal bank charters to provide checks and balances which promote consumer choice and a diverse and competitive financial system sensitive to the financial institutions of various complexity and size. Washington should allow community banks to work with borrowers in troubled times without adding to the costs and complexity of working with customers. Mr. Chairman, ICBA stands ready to work with you and the Senate Banking Committee on all of the challenges facing the financial system and how we may correct those issues gone awry and buttress those activities that continue to fuel the economies in rural areas. I am pleased to answer any questions you may have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF JACK HOPKINS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CORTRUST BANK NATIONAL ASSOCIATION, SIOUX FALLS, SOUTH DAKOTA, ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF AMERICA 
"Chairman Johnson","Thanks, Jack.",Speech, 
"Mr. Michael","Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you very much for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing on behalf of the Credit Union National Association. My name is Frank Michael, and I am President and CEO of Allied Credit Union in Stockton, California. Allied is a small institution with $20 million in assets and approximately 2,600 member owners. Credit unions--rural, urban, large, and small--did not contribute to the subprime meltdown or the subsequent credit market crisis. Credit unions are careful lenders. As not-for-profit cooperatives, our objective is to maximize member service. Incentives at credit unions are aligned in a way that ensures little or no harm is done to our member owners. Rural credit unions are unique in many respects. There are nearly 1,500 U.S. credit unions with a total of $60 billion in assets headquartered in rural areas. Rural credit unions tend to be small--even by credit union standards. Over half of the rural credit unions are staffed by five or fewer full-time equivalent employees. Even in good times, rural credit unions tend to face challenges in a way that larger institutions do not. Competitive pressures from large multistate banks and nontraditional financial services providers, greater regulatory burdens, growing member sophistication, and loss of sponsors loom large for most of the Nation's small credit unions. A bad economy can make things even worse. Small credit unions come under tremendous pressure as they attempt to advise, consult with, and lend to their members. In addition, all credit unions have suffered as a result of the effects of the financial crisis of corporate credit unions. Despite these substantial hurdles, rural credit unions are posting comparatively strong results, and they continue to lend. Loans grew by 7 percent in the 12 months ending in March compared to a 3-percent decline at all banks. There are several concerns raised by small credit unions, and rural credit unions in particular, that deserve mention. The credit union movement has seen small institutions merge into larger credit unions at an alarming pace. And by far, the largest contributor to this consolidation is the smothering effect of the current regulatory environment. Small credit union leaders believe that the regulatory scrutiny they face is inconsistent with both their exemplary behavior and their nearly imperceptible financial exposure they represent. A large community of credit unions, free of unnecessary regulatory burden, would benefit the public at large and especially our rural communities. As the Subcommittee considers regulatory restructuring proposals, we strongly urge you to continue to keep these concerns in the forefront of your decision making. Moreover, we implore you to look for opportunities to provide exemptions from the most costly and time-consuming initiatives to cooperatives and other small institutions. As noted above, credit unions have generally continued to lend while many other lenders have pulled back. This is certainly true in the business lending arena. Currently, 26 percent of all rural credit unions offer member business loans to their members. These loans represent over 9 percent of the total loans in rural credit union portfolios. In contrast, member business loans account for less than 6 percent of all total loans in the movement as a whole. Total member business loans at rural credit unions grew by over 20 percent in the year ending March 2009, with agricultural loans increasing by over 12 percent. Agricultural loans at rural credit unions now account for over one-third of the total member business loans. This is strong evidence that rural credit unions remain ``in the game'' during these trying times. But more could be done. And more should be done. A chorus of small business owners complains that they cannot get access to credit. Federal Reserve surveys show that the Nation's large banks tightened underwriting standards for the better part of the past year, and SBA research shows that large bank consolidation is making it more difficult for small businesses to obtain loans. The chief obstacle for credit union business lending is the statutory limits imposed by Congress in 1998 under which credit unions are restricted from member business lending in excess of 12.25 percent of their total assets. This arbitrary cap has no basis in either actual credit union business lending or safety and soundness considerations. Indeed, a report by the U.S. Treasury Department found that delinquencies and charge-offs for credit union business loans were much lower than those of banks. While we support strong regulatory oversight of how credit unions make member business loans, there is no safety and soundness rationale for the current law which restricts the amount of credit union business lending. There is, however, a significant economic reason to permit credit unions to lend without statutory restriction, as they were able to do prior to A growing list of small business and public policy groups agree that now is the time to eliminate the statutory credit union business lending cap. We urge Congress to eliminate the cap and provide NCUA with the authority to permit a credit union to engage in business lending above 20 percent of assets if safety and soundness considerations are met. If the cap were removed, credit unions could safely and soundly provide as much as $10 billion in new loans for small businesses within the first year. This is an economic stimulus that would truly help small business and not cost the taxpayers a dime. In conclusion, Chairman Johnson and Ranking Member Crapo, and all the Members of the Subcommittee, we appreciate your review of these issues today.",Statement,STATEMENT OF FRANK MICHAEL, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, ALLIED CREDIT UNION, STOCKTON, CALIFORNIA, ON BEHALF OF THE CREDIT UNION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
"Chairman Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Michael.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Subcommittee, my name is Art, and I am the Chairman and CEO of United Bank of Michigan, and I am the Chairman-Elect of the American Bankers Association. I am pleased to share the banking industry's perspective on banking and the economy in rural America. Community banks continue to be one of the most important resources supporting the economic health of rural communities. Not surprisingly, the banks that serve our Nation's small towns also tend to be small community banks. Less well known is that over 3,500 banks--41 percent of the banking industry--have fewer than 30 employees. These banks understand fully the needs of their customers and their community. This is not the first recession faced by banks. Most banks have been in their communities for decades and intend to be there for many decades to come. My bank was chartered in 1903. We have survived the Great Depression and many other ups and downs for over a century. And we are not alone. Over 2,500 banks--nearly one-third of the industry--have been in been in business for more than a century. These numbers tell a dramatic story about the staying power of community banks and their commitment to their communities. We cannot be successful unless we develop and maintain long-term relationships and treat our customers fairly. In spite of the downturn, community banks in rural communities expanded lending by 7 percent since the recession began. Loans made by banks that focus on farmers and ranchers also increased by 9 percent. Considerable challenges remain, of course. In my home State of Michigan, for example, we are facing our eighth consecutive year of job losses. Other rural areas with manufacturing employment bases are also suffering similar problems. In this environment, businesses are reevaluating their credit needs and, as a result, loan demand is declining. Banks, too, are being prudent in underwriting, and our regulators demand it. Accordingly, it is unlikely that loan volumes will increase this year. With the recession, credit quality has suffered and losses have increased. Fortunately, community banks entered this recession with strong capital levels. However, it is very difficult to raise new capital today. Without access to capital, maintaining the flow of credit in rural communities will be increasingly difficult. We believe the Government can take action to help viable community banks weather the current downturn. The success of local economies depends on the success of these banks. Comparatively small steps now can make a huge difference to these banks, their customers, and their communities--keeping capital and resources focused where they are needed most. Importantly, the amount of capital required to provide an additional cushion for all community banks--which had nothing to do with the current crisis--is tiny compared to the $182 billion provided to AIG. In fact, the additional capital needed is less than $3 billion for all smaller banks to be well capitalized, even under a baseline stress test. Simply put, capital availability means credit availability. In addition to providing avenues for new capital for community banks, we believe there are three key policy issues that deserve congressional action: one, creating a systemic regulator; two, providing a strong mechanism for resolving troubled systemically important firms; and, three, filling gaps in the regulation of the shadow banking industry. The critical issue in this regard is ``too-big-to-fail.'' This concept has profound moral hazard implications and competitive effects that need to be addressed. In an ideal world, no institution would be ``too-big-to-fail,'' and that is ABA's goal. While recent events have shown how difficult that is to accomplish, whatever is done on the systemic regulator and on a resolution system should narrow dramatically the range of circumstances that might be expected to prompt Government action. These actions would address the causes of the financial crisis and constitute major reform. We believe there is a broad consensus in addressing these issues. I would be happy to answer any questions that you may have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ARTHUR C.

"Chairman Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Johnson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Templeton","Good afternoon, Chairman Johnson, Ranking Member Crapo, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Ed Templeton, and I am here testifying today on behalf of the National Association of Federal Credit Unions. I am President of SRP Federal Credit Union in North Augusta, South Carolina. NAFCU and the entire credit union community appreciate the opportunity to participate in this discussion regarding how the economic crisis has impacted America's credit unions serving in rural communities. While credit unions have fared better than most financial institutions in these turbulent times, many have been impacted, through no fault of their own, by the current economic environment. Credit unions were not the cause of the current economic downturn, but we believe we can be an important part of the solution. Surveys of NAFCU member credit unions have shown that many are seeing increased demand for mortgage and auto loans as other lenders leave the markets. Credit unions have seen small businesses that have lost credit from other lenders turning to credit unions for the capital that they need. Credit unions are meeting those needs specifically in rural areas. NCUA data shows that credit unions have seen a growth in the percentage of the total amount of credit union farm loans for the last nine consecutive quarters. Additionally, the most recent HMDA data shows that credit union mortgage loans to Native Americans increased over the previous year and that credit unions had a higher percentage of approved loans--75.3 percent--than any other type of financial institution. Throughout the country, small credit union roundtables have emerged and engaged in discussions about operations with like institutions. Larger credit unions also serve as partners for the smaller ones and perform functions from shared branching to back-office operations. Credit unions are the most regulated of all financial institutions, facing restrictions on who they can serve and their ability to raise capital, among a host of other limitations. There are small statutory steps Congress can take to enhance the ability of credit unions to serve their members, such as: First, removal of the arbitrary credit union member lending cap. The Credit Union Membership Access Act established an arbitrary cap on credit union member business lending of 12.25 percent in 1998. Many credit unions have available capital that other lenders do not have in this environment, but are hampered by this arbitrary limitation. We are pleased that Senator Schumer has indicated that he plans to introduce legislation to remove this arbitrary cap, and we urge the Subcommittee to support these efforts. Second, underserved areas. As the Subcommittee may be aware, many rural areas are also underserved. Credit unions can play an important role in these communities. The 1998 Credit Union Membership Access Act gave the NCUA the authority to allow Federal credit unions to add underserved areas to their fields of membership; however, the language was unclear as to what types of charters can add underserved areas. NCUA believes that addressing this issue through legislation would clear up this ambiguity, allowing all Federal credit unions to add underserved areas to their fields of membership. Before wrapping up, I would like to make a few comments on the issue of regulatory reform. As not-for-profit member-owned cooperatives, credit unions are unique institutions in the financial services arena. We believe that the NCUA should remain an independent regulator of credit unions and are pleased to see that the administration's proposal would maintain the Federal credit union charter and an independent NCUA. NAFCU supports the creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that would have authority over nonregulated institutions that operate in the financial services marketplace. However, we do not support extending that authority to federally insured credit unions, given that the CFPA has authority to regulate, examine--or would have authority to regulate, examine, and supervise credit unions that are already regulated by the NCUA, which would add an additional burden and cost to credit unions. Recognizing that more should be done to help consumers, we propose that each functional regulator establish or strengthen a new office on consumer protection. We believe that such an approach would strengthen consumer protection while not adding unnecessary regulatory burdens on our Nation's credit unions. We are pleased to see that NCUA Board Chairman Mr. Michael Fryzel recently announced the creation of such an office at NCUA. In conclusion, the current economic crisis is having an impact on credit unions in rural areas, but we are continuing to serve our members well. As an illustration, we at SRP Federal Credit Union are actually expanding at this time into one of the most rural areas within our field of membership. We are about to break ground on a new branch in Allendale County, South Carolina. The county has a population of 10,477 and an unemployment rate of 22.1 percent. We urge the Subcommittee to support efforts to remove the credit union member business lending cap and to clarify the ability of credit unions of all charter types to add underserved areas. Finally, while there are positive aspects to consumer protection in regulatory reform, we believe that Federal credit unions continue to warrant an independent regulator that handles both safety and soundness and consumer protection matters. I thank you for the opportunity to appear before you today on behalf of NAFCU and our country's credit unions, and I would welcome any questions you may have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ED TEMPLETON, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SRP FEDERAL CREDIT UNION, NORTH AUGUSTA, SOUTH CAROLINA, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF FEDERAL CREDIT UNIONS 
"Chairman Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Templeton.",Speech, 
"Mr. Skillern","Thank you, Senator Johnson, for the opportunity to testify today on lenders, consumers, and the economy in rural areas. I am Peter Skillern, Executive Director of the Community Reinvestment Association of North Carolina. We are a nonprofit community advocacy and development agency. North Carolina has strong rural and banking sectors. Eighty-five of our 100 counties are rural and 50 percent of our population live in them. We have 106 credit unions and 106 banks, ranging from the largest in the country, Bank of America, down to Mount Gilead Savings and Loan at $9.8 million. The current economic stresses for our rural communities and small financial institutions are significant, and they are best understood in the context of two long-term trends: one is a decline in the rural economy, and two is the consolidation of the financial sector. And our policy recommendations focus on two issues: one is the financial regulatory reform to provide greater consumer protections and stability; and two is the investment needed in our rural communities for recovery and growth--in particular, through the Neighborhood Stabilization Program. Rural Economies are in long-term decline. In North Carolina, the unemployment rate is the fifth highest in the country, but our rural communities are taking it even harder. The rates in 19 counties range between 14 and 17 percent. But these rates are years in the making. Rural North Carolina did not recover from the 2001 recession. From 2002 to 2008, rural counties lost more than 100,000 jobs in the manufacturing sector of textiles, apparel, furniture, and automobiles. Changes in tobacco and the agricultural sector have reduced the number of small farms. Tobacco farms have dropped by 70 percent since 2002. Forty of our rural counties lost population. These long-term trends, in combination with the credit crisis and recession, have contributed to an estimate 31,000 foreclosures in rural North Carolina. That is more than in the urban areas. Small banks also face challenges in the consolidation of the financial sector. During this crisis, a number of small banks across the Nation have failed, but far more have been lost through consolidation. Nationally, the number of banks with under $100 million in assets dropped by more than 5,000 from 1992 to 2008. In North Carolina, rural counties hold 50 percent of the population and 50 percent of bank branches, and only 16 percent of the deposit base. Nationally, approximately 4,000 small banks accounted for less than 2 percent of the national mortgage activity. By contrast, the consolidation of assets and market share of megabanks has increased. In 1995, the top five banks had 11 percent of the deposit share; today, they have nearly 40 percent. In the first quarter of 2009, 56 percent of mortgage activity was conducted by just four lenders. Small banks are at a competitive disadvantage in terms of efficiencies, pricing products, and geographical service areas, and consolidation will continue in the foreseeable future. This is a problem. As a rule, small banks and credit unions avoided subprime credit and provided stability and diversification in the financial sector. Without smaller institutions, many areas would go completely unserved. Banking policy and regulatory oversight should proactively support small banks and credit unions as essential to the local economic ecology of credit and commerce. Financial reform will help consumers, lenders, and the rural communities. Consumers in rural and urban areas face similar lending abuses. Rural areas had a higher percentage of subprime high-cost loans than urban areas. Rural areas have a high rate of refund anticipation loans, and payday lenders are prevalent in the rural areas of the 35 States that allow this usurious type of lending. Consumers need better protections from unsound and unscrupulous lending practices, and if so provided, our economy would be safer as well. Our financial sector would be better. Our agency is supportive of President Obama's recommendation for the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act. We support the CRA Modernization Act, H.B. 1492. And faced with a rising tide of foreclosures and insufficient loan modification programs, we ask the Senate to reconsider and favorably pass a loan judicial modification bill. We support reforms for greater oversight and capital requirements to mitigate the risk of megabanks. Finally, please invest in our rural communities. Although the problems created by the financial crisis and recession are felt by every community and the solutions needed are national in scope, it would be a mistake to assume that urban and rural communities will shake off the recession with the same speed. The long-term challenges for small banks and rural communities are systemic as well as cyclical. Unless we invest in rebuilding these communities, no banks of any size will thrive. Please expand the Neighborhood Stabilization Program both in scale of funding and in scope to include rural areas. NSP funds are to revitalize foreclosed properties and to rebuild distressed communities. But no rural areas receive NSP funds because the needs test emphasizes concentration. Yet in 23 States, such as North Carolina, in the aggregate there are more foreclosures in rural area than urban areas. More funding is needed given the need in both urban and rural areas. The future for rural communities and banks is brighter if we recognize and act on the need for financial regulatory reform and investment in our communities. Thank you very much for your attention.",Statement,STATEMENT OF PETER SKILLERN, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT ASSOCIATION OF NORTH CAROLINA 
"Chairman Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Skillern. A question for Mr. Hopkins and Mr. Johnson. In May, the FDIC decided to place a special assessment to rebuild the Deposit Insurance Fund on assets instead of deposits, largely because of concerns raised by small banks that they were being unfairly affected by the irresponsible behavior of larger banks. Is the FDIC's change a good thing for your institutions? Do you have any concerns about this change? Mr. Hopkins.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Obviously, we were very supportive of the change. We have long held that it is the assets of a bank that create the risk, and not the deposits. And, therefore, the risks should be associated with the assets of the bank. It is giving credit for the higher capital levels, so from the standpoint of a community bank where its assets are on the books and its liabilities are primarily core deposits and not other sources of liquidity, be it commercial paper or other borrowings, we think it was appropriate, and it has been very positive for community banks.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Do you have any concerns?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Do I have any concerns?",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","I would ask that they consider using that base for the deposit insurance premium going forward.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Mr. Johnson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","I do have some concerns. It seems to me that this is a change that has the potential to have a rather profound public policy impact going forward and should be something that is considered very carefully. And I think it should be considered in the context of the solutions that the Congress is seeking for the ``too-big-to-fail'' issue and the systemically important institutions, these systemically important institutions are--some of whom are depository institutions, and some of which are not. And as you consider what you are going to do with them, what is going to be the resolution for future problems with systemically important firms, both depositories and nondepositories, presumably there will be a consideration of how the cost of that resolution is going to be considered and solved. And I think to tackle the assessment base and the FDIC fund prior to dealing with the solution to the funding of resolution of systemically important firms, both depositories and nondepositories, would be premature.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Thank you. A question for Mr. Hopkins, Mr. Michael, Mr. Johnson, and",Speech, 
"Mr. Templeton","Mr. Skillern's testimony said that in North Carolina there is a higher percentage of subprime mortgages in rural areas than urban areas although the actual volume is lower. Do you find that this is true in the areas your institutions serve? Are you finding that those homeowners with subprime mortgages in your areas are underwater? Are existing loan modification programs useful to you in helping these homeowners? Mr. Hopkins.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","I would say that we do not have the issues with the subprime mortgages in South Dakota and, in general, most of the rural areas of the Midwest. I think it was more of a conservative lending philosophy, and we did not have a lot of the mortgage brokers in our areas. Those that we have had have come in to us, and we did not have the rapid increases in the home valuations as seen in some of the more urban areas of California, Nevada, Florida, Michigan, and some of those areas--Michigan, I take that back, has not had the rapid rise. But some of these other areas that have had the rapid rise, therefore, they have been easier to refinance into conventional mortgages when they have come in. And we have used the loan modification program for those that have come in and have found it to be successful to this point.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Mr. Michael.",Speech, 
"Mr. Michael","Well, I am from Stockton, California. Home values in Stockton are down 63 percent from the peak. They are down 37 percent in the last 12 months, and they are still declining. Yes, subprime mortgages, 0 percent down mortgages, clearly contributed significantly to our problems. We are finding, as I work with my members, that many--the credit unions did not originate these loans. We did not--we always, as lenders, have been originating generally for our own portfolios, which means the ones that were really originating these loans were those that were originating to sell and looking for the fee income that came with that. Credit unions generally portfolio their own loans as part of the process, so I am dealing with members who are coming to me today trying to deal with other lenders in this process and other servicing companies. We are finding in my conversations with my particular members that the lenders are slow on the modification process. I am hearing from those that are working in the real estate industry working with individuals and doing modifications, and even short sales, that those institutions trying to process modifications are not geared up at this time to processes effectively, and the delays are substantial and the results are generally not positive.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Mr. Johnson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","In our bank, we are having some elevated levels of delinquency and foreclosures within our bank, but they are all driven by employment issues rather than by product issues. We did not make any subprime or high-risk mortgages. We have 11 offices, and eight of them are in rural communities, and it would be my observation that--well, the administration has stated that 94 percent of high-risk mortgages were made by nondepository institutions, and my rough observation of what is going on in our marketplace, including our rural offices, is that that percentage is even higher than that because the community banks in our area simply were not making those types of mortgages. I can tell you that in our office with our own customers, we are working very diligently with them to keep those families in their homes wherever it is remotely possible to do so and are having a fair amount of success with that. We are having our customers who opted within the last few years to obtain a mortgage from one of the many mortgage brokers, mortgage originators that are in our entire marketplace, simply to have a lower monthly payment, they are now coming in to us and seeing whether or not they can get a solution to keep themselves in their home. And we are successful in about 20 percent of those cases to be able to get them refinanced into a conventional mortgage product. Unfortunately, I do not always know what happens to the other 80 percent.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Mr. Templeton.",Speech, 
"Mr. Templeton","We have seen some of the things more similar to what the gentleman from South Dakota was saying. We just did not see a big inflow into our marketplace of lenders who were offering loans that just didn't make good sense, and I think primarily because we didn't see extreme home value rises over the past 2 or 3 years in our marketplace. It was a more reasonable rise, which I think led to people searching for more reasonable loans. Now, that said, we have certainly had foreclosures. We have had modifications that we have done. But I am not sure that I am--I am not aware of any loan that specifically was a result of some type of egregious act, where somebody put somebody in an interest-only loan or something like that. All we have been seeing is the normal re-fis that people are going through because of the market that we are in. Like the gentleman from South Dakota, we did not originate the sales, so every loan we made through last year is currently in a portfolio. This year, we are originating some for sale, but they are what everybody would call a conforming, main- stream type of loan. I would go one step further to say one thing as concerns the rural areas. In our market, anyway, those brokers weren't interested in the rural areas because those homes were not homes that they could sell as a package to anybody. There was no appreciation in values. They were--before we invented the phrase subprime mortgage, you go back 4 or 5 years ago, if you think about what you would call a subprime home or subprime mortgage, it was an inexpensive home on a dirt street that needed painting and that is what a lot of the homes in our rural communities are and we lend to a lot of those people. So that is what we call internally our subprime, because nobody else will touch a home like that, but that is what we do and that is what we are about. And consequently, we are not suffering in our community from a serious issue with egregious lending. Maybe some are there, I am just not aware of it, but I stay pretty close with the community. Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Senator Crapo.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and I want to commend all of our witnesses for very capably explaining the important role that community banks play in our rural communities as well as throughout our economy. I am going to use my time today to focus on the administration's Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and Mr. Johnson, I will focus on you, but I welcome comments or responses to my question from anybody else on the panel. The issue I have is that I think in our effort to find the right balance between protecting consumers from abusive products and practices while promoting responsible lending to spur economic growth to help get our economy moving again, we need to get it right with regard to consumer protection. And to me, at least, the case has not been adequately made that we should bifurcate consumer protection from safety and soundness regulation. I know there are some recent articles that have come out with regard to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac with some of those who are very prominent in the current management of them who indicated that the bifurcation of consumer protection and safety and soundness regulation with our GSEs was, in fact, one of the problems that helped us get into trouble with regard to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The administration's proposal would have sole rulemaking authority for consumer financial protection statutes, as well as the ability to fill gaps through rulemaking, placed in this one single new agency to be created. I guess the question I would like to toss out, really to the whole panel but start with you, Mr. Johnson, is has the case been made that bifurcating the protections from prudential supervision is the best option to protect consumers from abusive practices and products?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Well, I think that it has not been made, and at least in my mind, it will be very difficult to make that. I think in addition to the commentators about Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, I believe that Sheila Bair has made similar comments that for the FDIC, that it would be a mistake to divide prudential regulation from consumer protection and compliance into more than one agency. It strikes me that knowing something--that there are two elements here, and for each element to do their job correctly, they need to know something about what is going on in the other piece and that would be, it strikes me, it would be very difficult to accomplish when it is two completely different agencies that have two completely different missions. It seems to me, as I mentioned before, that the fact of the matter is that 94 percent of the high-risk lending that has gotten us into much of what our current problem is occurred in nondepository institutions. Clearly, we need to focus on the 6 percent, but probably we don't need to overhaul the entire system to deal with 6 percent. But we shouldn't forget about dealing with the 94 percent, and that is what I am afraid we are doing here. My bank is a State-chartered nonmember bank, and what that means is that we are regulated by our State regulator, the Office of Financial and Insurance Regulation, and a Federal regulator, the FDIC. These are both very strong, competent regulatory agencies. Each of them takes their responsibilities for regulating us and all the other State banks in Michigan, regulating both our compliance, consumer protection, and our safety and soundness operations, they take it very seriously and it is a system that works very well. I think, in fact, it is a model that should be strongly considered when we deal with the 94 percent, a strong, competent, well-funded State regulator as well as a strong, competent, well-funded Federal regulator. And I might add that when I talk about funding in both of those instances, in our case in Michigan, it is our industry that funds that through either FDIC premiums or examination fees for a State regulator.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. Let us just start over here, if any of the other members of the panel want to speak. We just have a couple more minutes in my timeframe, so please try to be as succinct as you can. But if you would like to make a comment, please do.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Thank you. I would just echo that I would agree with Mr. Johnson. The one thing to keep in mind, also, is that the examiners are coming in from--and I have had an OCC examined bank and FDIC--they are very well trained. They are certified. They have to take a lot of testing. They take it very serious, and I can tell you, after 25 years of banking, when they come in, they are very prepared to make examinations and they can be harsh if you don't follow the rules to the letter of the law. So I would agree that that 6 percent that is unregulated needs to find a place to be regulated, whether that is an additional arm through this new agency or through the FTC. I think there is opportunity there. But I think that the banking regulators do an adequate job.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Mr. Michael.",Speech, 
"Mr. Michael","I generally concur with the statements that were made. Clearly, there are consumers that need protection that are not receiving it right now and there is a need to extend protection to those individuals and we need to find a way to do it. But we are very heavily regulated as it is right now and adding an additional layer of regulation would be very problematic. As an example, it would lead to dual examinations for my credit union from both Consumer Protection Agency and my prudential regulator. I would recommend that we look at using the current prudential regulators to provide that type of examination and supervision.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. Mr. Templeton.",Speech, 
"Mr. Templeton","Thank you, sir. Actually, our Federal regulator, the NCUA, has already put the first foot forward. They have already created that office internal to our regulator, so we are moving toward consumer protection within the prudential regulator. And as the gentleman said, I think when you are talking about federally insured depository institutions, the regulators are in place to take care of safety and soundness and also financial consumer protection within that. They know the businesses. It is one more element. It will be very cost effective. You are not going to have a big education curve. You are not going to have a training curve. But more importantly, you are not going to have one hand saying, do something, and another hand over here saying, do something different, which could very easily be in contrast with each other. The nondepository institutions, I think that is a whole another ballgame, though. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. Mr. Skillern.",Speech, 
"Mr. Skillern","I would concur with the bankers that, in general, the small banks are well regulated by both their State and primary regulators. I would also disagree, though, that the Federal regulators have done their job well currently. Countrywide, Washington Mutual are both regulated by the OTS. Their subprime predatory lending harmed consumers and collapsed their banks. Wachovia, a national bank regulated by the OCC, crashed itself on exotic mortgage lending. The Federal Reserve has failed to enforce its rules. I am currently in a fight with the OCC to enforce the rules on Santa Barbara Bank and Trust around their refund anticipation loan loss. It is just not happening. So the Federal regulators have lost credibility on their willingness and ability to enforce the existing consumer laws. I do believe that a separate agency with that focus brings standardization of how those rules are applied, can expand it to those agencies that are not covered, and hopefully try to reduce the seemingly conflict of interest that the existing Federal regulators have of enforcing consumer laws.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you. My time is up. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Senator Bennet.",Speech, 
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for holding this hearing. It is very timely, at least from my perspective, coming from Colorado, where we have had a bank failure in rural Colorado, in Weld County that I wanted to talk to you about a little bit. I want to thank everybody here for your testimony. I think it is a very good reminder that we need to be very careful about how we think about our financial institutions in this country because they are not all the same and not all of them contributed to the situation that we now find ourselves in. With respect to ``too-big-to-fail,'' which people have talked about, from the point of view of the people living in Northeast Colorado who lost what to many people would seem was a very small bank, that bank was too big to fail for them. It has affected the entire region, because commodity prices are where they are, in this case particularly dairy prices. It has become incredibly hard to find replacement credit for the farmers and for the ranchers that are there. I wonder--we have asked the people administering the TARP whether or not they are taking into account those sorts of circumstances as they think about the distribution of the TARP money, and I wonder if any of you have a perspective on how well or how poorly TARP is being administered when it comes to small banks, to rural banks, community banks. The application process is an onerous one. The requirements for deposits are tough. I am just curious whether you think we are getting done what we need to get done with respect to TARP.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Why don't you go ahead?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Thank you. In my opinion, the TARP has helped to pick winners and losers. The big banks, particularly the largest 19, have all been chosen as winners in this game, because even though they were technically broke, they have been bailed out. The smaller community banks, if you were not a one or two rated with a CAMELS rating in the bank, you cannot qualify for the funds, and that does make that kind of an unfair advantage of being to the large banks. So I do know of a couple of banks that have had some financial difficulties around the country because of the areas they are located in and they have applied for the funds and been denied because the credit quality in that area is difficult. And obviously raising private capital in today's market is difficult.",Speech, 
"Senator Bennet","Mr. Johnson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","To some degree, we are kind of guessing about what the criteria are and how the process goes because it has never been made public exactly what the criteria is to determine at Treasury and at the agencies in terms of their recommendation to Treasury and then Treasury's decision about who is going to be approved for CPP money under the TARP program and who isn't. So that is problematic to begin with. But beyond that, it is our contention that there--like there are many, many viable homeowners that we should take action to save them and keep them in their homes and banks are working with small businesses and with farmers to determine who are those viable small businesses and who are the viable farmers so that we can do whatever we can to keep them in business, so should the Treasury and the Federal regulators of depository institutions work very hard at determining who are the viable banks and make sure that they have access to capital so that we close no more banks than we need to. Now, clearly, there are going to be banks that fail and there will be others that will fail. But only the ones that deserve to fail should be the ones that fail, and if there are viable banks that are not being, through accounting treatment and through regulatory fiat that was designed in a different time and place and isn't as applicable in today's world as it should be, the regulators have the capability, I believe, of making management assessments and determining who are the viable banks and I believe that they should have access to that capital.",Speech, 
"Senator Bennet","Does anybody else have a comment? Mr. Michael.",Speech, 
"Mr. Michael","Senator Bennet, just a reminder. The credit unions have never had access to the TARP funds, although there have been some credit unions that expressed a need to have access. But we have been locked out of that opportunity. So we can't comment on the process, other than the fact that we are outside looking in.",Speech, 
"Senator Bennet","It would seem to me--that is an interesting point, Mr. Johnson, on the criteria question, because one of the questions that I have had for the administration is shouldn't we take into account the fact that you may have a financial institution--with respect to TARP, a financial institution failing in a region and there simply not being any credit available as part of the way we approach this question, because there is simply no place for anybody to go, at least in that part of my State. I want to ask you about modifications. You talked earlier about home mortgage loan modifications. Are you seeing--these are people that are still paying on their loans but may not have the income that they had before because they are unemployed. Is that the issue, rather than their home value falling in these regions below what it once was worth?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Well, we don't have--we have home values that are falling, but we never had big run-ups in values in the past. So that is--there are some areas of the country where perhaps if a loan is seasoned 5 or 7 years, it may have dropped 20 percent. But it probably went up more than that over that period of time. So if they didn't releverage that home, they are probably in a position where they could refinance, and that is a problem in Michigan, because we never had that big run-up and yet we have still had the big run-down. We basically have two types of mortgages. We do originate mortgages that we sell to Freddie Mac, although we retain servicing on all of those mortgages, so the point of contact for our customer is still us. Now, we have to follow the Freddie Mac guidelines when we are dealing with delinquencies, nonpayment in that portfolio and that is precisely what we do. We are working very hard to figure out what those guidelines are and are following them and have done a good number of modifications that are now moving into the second, third month of that program and I think we are going to be saving quite a few of those folks. But we also have portfolio loans, where we were making loans that did not, for one reason or another, fit in a box with Freddie Mac. And frankly, our approach on those is a rather tried and true one that has worked for us, for our bank, for all the time that I have been there, which is some 40 years, and that is if this home is going to be foreclosed upon, we are then going to have to go through a fairly expensive phase where we get an appraisal. We have to get the folks out of the house. They have some recourse to extend that period of time. But ultimately, we then get possession of the home. We have the problem where the folks have probably not been taking very good care of it for the past several months since they are going to leave, so the value of the home further goes down. We have an unoccupied home in a market that is filled with unoccupied homes at that point. So very often, the best thing for us to do is essentially sell that house back to the people that already live there. The house is worth what it is worth, and if that means that we take a loss, then we take a loss. We are going to take a loss if we sell it to somebody else, so we might just as well recognize what the value of that home is, and if that family can make a payment based upon that new valuation, then that is the way we proceed. Everybody wins. The value of the house is higher than it would have been if it had been vacant for 6 months and we keep the folks in the home and we keep a customer on our books.",Speech, 
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for your testimony.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Senator Corker.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I want to thank all of you for very good testimony and would reiterate what everyone has said. I think having people like you here that represent the type of banks that most of us know well throughout the country is a very good thing, and again, your testimony has been outstanding. Mr. Johnson, I want to say that as head of the ABA, I very much appreciated your comments about the administration's proposal on too big to fail and I certainly hope that you all will weigh in. It is pretty evident to me that what they have laid out is they want to continue business as it has been over the last year and basically codifying TARP so that they can decide on an ad hoc basis which firms will succeed and which will not, and I certainly hope you all will weigh in and certainly appreciate the comments you made in that regard. I want to change tracks just a little bit, because I think our fellow colleagues here have asked some wonderful questions and you all have highlighted numbers of things. We have not had a hearing here on Fannie and Freddie in a year. It is pretty amazing, actually. One of the organizations doesn't have a CEO. The trillions of dollars of assets, I mean, it is just an amazing thing that this Banking Committee has not had a hearing there. The former Treasury Secretary had some thoughts about what ought to happen to Fannie and Freddie, and again in this regulation proposal, Fannie and Freddie aren't even addressed, OK. There are some people in the country that would like to see Fannie and Freddie go away and think for the Federal Government to be in this kind of business is not a good thing. I see that you guys have these core deposits that are very important to you, and yet the residential industry is basically almost off limits because we have these huge GSEs that basically everybody funnels 30-year mortgages into. I am wondering, in your own communities, and I will ask Mr. Hopkins first, what would be--if these entities did not exist, how would community bankers feel about that? Would that be a huge opportunity for you, instead of having to go to commercial loans for profit making purposes that are very cyclical? Would that be an opportunity or would that be detrimental to you?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","For our institution, it would be very detrimental because we originate approximately--this year, we are on track, with all the mortgage brokers that have gone out of business, to originate $250 million worth of mortgage loans, and I don't know how we could sustain that on a going-forward basis with the capital that we have and being only a $550 million bank as it is. So it is important for us to have access to secondary market funds. It is critical that we have that access because the housing market is a very concentrated industry, and without it, we could not compete with the Bank of Americas and the Wells Fargos and those and I think the market would become a lot more concentrated. We do service those mortgages. Those customers, for all intents and purposes, don't know that we don't hold the dollars on our books because everything comes out in our name. We are the point of contact.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So the fee income in originating those is far more important to you than holding portfolio loans like you do with the commercial real estate?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","It gets down to the interest risk that you would be taking on by putting on 30-year mortgages versus short-term deposits.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And is there a way--and I figured that might be your response, so is there a way for the Federal Government to be involved in hedging that risk for you and yet not taking ownership through these GSEs of the portfolios themselves? Is there a solution there that might make sense without us taking on the risk of credit in the portfolios itself?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Well, again, I think it becomes an allocation of capital. We are required to have certain levels of capital and we would eat up our capital very quick. If we were to do 2 years' worth of mortgages, we might be done because our capital ratios would be required, particularly your leverage ratio.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And I see, Mr. Hopkins, you are shaking your head in agreement with what he is----",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Yes. It is really very true. It is one of the few points of access to the capital markets that community banks have, the securitization of residential mortgages, and we get paid--you mentioned fee income, and it is important to note that actually our up-front fee for selling a loan with servicing retained, which is what our bank does and what I understand yours is doing, as well, is really much lower than if we sold the loan with servicing released, which means some other servicer would be doing it. So because we are in the relationship business, we want to maintain that contact with our customers and are willing to take, frankly, a lower up-front fee for doing that in terms of what we get paid when we sell the loan. But it gives us tremendous access to the capital markets that we wouldn't have otherwise and we are still able to maintain that relationship but have it off our balance sheets.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So in seeking a solution to the Fannie- Freddie dilemma that all of us find ourselves in, because if it were actually truly shown on our country's balance sheet, we would have some tough issues to deal with here, we need to figure out a way to deal still, though, with creating liquidity for you to keep this constant access to capital.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","I think you have hit the nail on the head, is whose balance sheet is it going to be on, and it really can't be on ours, either, because of the capital concerns.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So let me go back to the community bankers--and thank you for those answers--back to the community bankers. What relationship change has occurred at all over the last year with correspondent banks, the folks that you deal with that are sort of one tier up that are your correspondent lenders? Has there been much of a change there?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Yes, there has. Access to the secondary market, selling to them, has dried up. In most cases, they have canceled contracts, et cetera. So Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac right now are about the only game in town if you are a community bank trying to get access to the secondary markets.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So the regionals upstream from you that typically would have provided liquidity--and I could name names, but I won't--those folks who we are up here constantly talking to about making loans and they are constantly telling us that they are making more loans than they made in the past, those folks, as far as their correspondent relationship, from your perspective, that has gone away for you?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Well, that has gone away in that respect and also in the second respect, is I really don't want to turn my best customers over to them and give them the primary relationship. If I send the mortgage to one of the large banks, I have lost that relationship because the only way I can do it is selling that service released, which means they have the contact with the customer.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Since you represent all of these folks, do you have any comments there?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Well, I guess the only experience I have is really within my own bank directly that I can speak with a great deal of authority on. We continue to have a Fed funds line, which is an overnight borrowing facility which we have for liquidity purposes, but we very, very rarely use. We used to have those lines with two correspondent banks and now we have them with one.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","On a scale of one to ten, I mean, is that a major issue with each of you individually or is that a minor issue? Is that an issue for us to pay attention to here or is that an issue that there are bigger fish to fry?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Well, to be perfectly honest, most banks fail in an immediate sense because of liquidity rather than because of asset quality problems. Maybe I am getting a little far afield here, but liquidity is always a very important discussion when we have our regulators into our banks, but it is even more so in a time of stress to the industry like this. The availability of--you really have to deal with on-balance sheet liquidity and off-balance sheet liquidity and lines from other banks are a critical component of that off-balance sheet liquidity. It is deserving of some attention.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I thank you. My time is up. I apologize to the other witnesses. There are a number of things--I would like to just reiterate what I think Mr. Hopkins said earlier, and that is I think the regulators--and we have had them into our office numbers of times--I think they are helping, as they always do, create self-fulfilling prophecy by virtue of the way they are dealing with our institutions. We have talked to them. I know that you all have probably talked to them. But I just hope that all of us will keep in mind that I think what Mr. Hopkins said was--the regulators are clamping down and helping make this recession more severe than it otherwise would have been. But anyway, thank you very much. I wish I had more time. I appreciate it.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","Senator Tester.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would agree with that assessment, Senator Corker. I think the regulators are a bit paranoid at this point in time and they don't want to have any failure on their watch. I think that is probably human nature, but I think we need to put pressure on them to make sure they use common sense in their regulation. A couple of questions. I will just start with you, Mr. Hopkins. It deals with agriculture. It deals with agriculture operating loans specifically, on the ground. What has been the impact of the economic downturn on your availability of dollars for ag-operating loans?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","We have adequate dollars available for ag- operating loans, and for the most part, most of our ag producers have done quite well. We are in a heavy crop area and the corn and soybean prices have been quite good. The problem we are seeing with some of our operators is the input costs over the last 12 to 24 months have increased dramatically. We feel at some point the commodity prices will come down more. We are seeing some real pressure on our livestock producers. Those are the people that I think we are seeing some real pressure on right now and I think it will be more so going forward over the next 12 to 24 months.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Do you have much dairy in your region?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","We don't have a lot of dairy in our region anymore. We did at one time, but we do not have a lot in our area.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. How about land acquisition? I don't know if you give any loans out for land purchase or not, but how are the dollars for that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","We have adequate dollars available for lending for land acquisition also. Probably the concern there is that we have had a rapid spike in land prices over the last 5 years----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","----and so that does concern us.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. Commercial real estate, and I am sorry I missed your testimony. I got called to the floor, so I apologize for that. I wish I could have heard it all. So I will just kind of go by your titles about what I think you know, and if somebody wants to jump in, they can. This is for Mr. Johnson. I really heard from many of the bankers back in Montana that there is a concern about the commercial real estate sector and actually heard some of it back here, too. They are predicting that may be the next domino in the credit crisis and could impact the Rocky Mountain West in a very negative way. Do you have any perspective or thoughts on that, on the commercial markets and where they are at and where they are headed?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Yes. I think it is probably a fair observation. Exactly how bad it gets and how long it lasts is sort of the unknown there. My perspective from Michigan is, you know, the one thing about high unemployment is that its effects are fairly predictable and its effects are very, very broad and very deep. We are, to some degree, a fairly active commercial real estate lender. We show up on the radar screen of our regulators for additional scrutiny in that regard, which we have so far successfully satisfied them. But when people don't have jobs anymore or they don't have as much income in the family as they had before and they are not shopping as much, that begins to affect retail and the impact, you know, you go by shopping centers and once the vacancy rate starts getting above 10 percent, you know that there is going to be stress on the value of those properties. Really, you have to approach that from a bank perspective-- first of all, you have to hope that you are well capitalized, and if, in fact, you are well capitalized, then you are going to be able to work with those businesses and essentially keep those commercial real estate enterprises open the same way that you would work with a homeowner or a small business person. Just sort of dig your nails into the ledge and hold on as long as you can.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","And this is directed to both of you, Mr. Johnson and Mr. Michael. From your perspective, is the economic downturn as it applies to commercial or even private residences, homeowners, are rural areas being more impacted than urban areas, or is it about the same, or is it being less impacted?",Speech, 
"Mr. Michael","Well, I would probably comment that probably the areas that are most heavily impacted are those that sit between rural and urban, the exurbs, and that is what I would define Stockton as being, and that is the area--the one that sits on the fringe is the one that is really getting trashed right now.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. Regulators--and I don't want to spend a lot of time on this. Senator Corker talked about it a little bit. There has been some talk about combining OCC and OTS and FDIC and portions of the Fed and maybe coming up with a regulator that is more inclusive, less gaps. What are your thoughts on that? I will just ask Mr. Hopkins for your perspective on that, if we were to do something like that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","We believe in a strong dual banking system, so we do believe that the competition amongst the regulators, just as it does with competition amongst banks, does make for stronger banks and stronger regulators.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","We are going to maintain the dual charters?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Maintain the dual charters.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","But we will combine the ones at the Fed level?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","If they combine the ones at the Fed level, we ask that they consider keeping a separate division to help with the OTS, because those institutions do focus on home lending and that is still their charter and mission.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. And this can go to either one. There was a point in time not too many years ago--I know for a fact two-and-a-half years ago--interest-only loans were very, very common. Low down payments, no down payments, were reasonably common. Has that changed?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","From the banking perspective, I am not sure they were available. That really came from the unregulated financial institutions that were selling into the secondary market.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Well----",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","So that has changed because those lenders are no longer around.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. I actually was, in fact, from a bank offered an interest only, no down loan to buy a house in Washington, DC. Could I still get that loan?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Not from my bank.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Not from my bank.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","You know my balance sheet.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","What about down payments? Down payments, have they gone up, and by how much have they gone up? I am talking about a requirement. It used to be, it seems like, in the good old days--if they were, in fact, good old days--a down payment was pretty substantial on a home. Where is it at now?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Well, generally speaking, in our bank, it hasn't changed all that much----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","What were your requirements?",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","Generally 20 percent. We had some programs that we participated in that were very, very focused that were able to have lower down payments, but it did not combine everything. It wasn't a low down payment and a negative amortization and this and that.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","All right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","We have--the programs typically are the 20 percent down, but we do have the FHA programs which are 3.5 percent down, but they are very strictly underwritten----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","----as to income and credit.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","One last question and then I will go, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the latitude. Oftentimes, particularly young couples that went in, they have been looking to buy their first home. This is a few years back--3, 4, 5 years back--and they needed, $100,000, $150,000. We are talking Montana here, so you know what I mean. It is probably similar to where you are at, Mr. Hopkins, where that is a decent home. And they would come in for the loan and the bank would say, you are eligible for $200,000. Is that still going on, or did it ever go on in your neck of the woods?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hopkins","Not to my knowledge. It didn't happen at our bank.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Johnson","It didn't happen at our bank, but that did happen in our market from nondepositories, and those are some of the loans that we are--I mean, those people are now coming in and talking to us and we are not able to save all of them.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Yes. Well, I certainly appreciate your perspective on the programs. I am sorry I didn't ask a whole bunch of questions to the other witnesses. It doesn't mean you are not very, very important. I once again apologize for not being here for the testimony, because this is very important. You guys are critically important, and I will tell you what I tell my community bankers. You need to be regulated, but you are not the ones that caused the problem. The same thing with the credit unions, too, I might add. You are not the ones that caused the problem. The Wall Street people were the ones, and quite honestly, the ``too-big-to-fail'' is something that I personally have a great disdain for, whether it is in banking or whether it is in agriculture or whether it is in energy or whether it is in food, whatever. We need to rethink some of these operating systems we have in this country. Thank you for the work you do.",Speech, 
"Chairman Johnson","I want to thank the witnesses once again for traveling so far to be here today. I look forward to working with the Members of the Banking Committee in the coming weeks as we continue to consider measures to capitalize the banking sector and our economy as a whole. This hearing is now adjourned.",Speech,
