"The Chairman","The hearing will come to order. I apologize. I was delayed a few minutes and I regret that. We will have 10 minutes on each side for opening statements and the gentleman from Illinois is recognized for 3 minutes."
"Mr. Gutierrez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to thank the Secretary for coming here today; and, while I support most of the legislation, I am apprehensive about the way we propose to create a fund to pay for the costs associated with the resolution of a failed, systematically significant financial institution. It seems to me that behavior that was reckless, dangerous, and risky in the past has generated huge profits and gains and allowed Wall Street executives to line their pockets with hundreds of millions of dollars, if not become billionaires in this process; that greed, that avarice, should it ever raise its ugly head once again, there should be an insurance fund paid for them. These are good times. We read all about how good the Wall Street giants are doing once again and how their profitability is there. They should set aside some of that money. Most of us don't die and then buy a life insurance policy. Most of us say, in case something happens to Luis, let me make sure if I owe people money and if I have responsibilities, that I leave my family and all of those to whom I have a responsibility, that I set aside some money and I buy some insurance. It would be wonderful that one day I would just wake up cold and that all my debtors and everybody would say, oh, let's go take the life insurance policy on Luis. That's not the way it works. The way it works, and Wall Street has to learn, because I read in the paper this morning, Mr. Secretary, they're complaining. Record profits on Wall Street, and they're complaining that the Congress of the United States might require them to set aside some of those billions of dollars in earnings so that in the eventuality that they might become systematically risky to us and fail, that there be money set aside for that. No more American taxpayer money should be set aside in case we have the kind of tragedy and economic failure that we saw in the last couple of years. So my basic premise today is, look, they were greedy. They should pay for future insurance policy payouts. The fund should be set up just in case their behavior, their reckless and dangerous and risky behavior, raises its ugly head again. And I look forward not only today but to the process of designing legislation that makes sure that those risky institutions are paying into a fund now, today--not after the fact. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","Mr. Chairman, as you know from the letter you received from the House Financial Services Committee Republicans yesterday, the process for considering the most far-reaching reforms of our financial system since the Great Depression should be deliberative and not hurried. The draft legislation that was supposed to be the subject of this hearing was not received until Tuesday afternoon. I doubt that any of today's witnesses, with the possible exception of Secretary Geithner, have had an opportunity to fully comprehend the legislation in its entirety or to arrive at informed views on its merits. Under the rules of this committee, the witnesses' written testimony was due 2 days before this hearing, which is to say it was due before the draft bill was released. The written testimony, therefore, cannot and does not address in any meaningful way the legislation we are marking up early next week. Although we have had the draft bill for less than 48 hours, even a cursory reading shows that the Administration has chosen to continue its failed policy of costly taxpayer bailouts orchestrated behind closed doors by officials of the Treasury and the Federal Reserve. The Democrats' talking points that their new proposal ends the era of ``too-big-to-fail'' are just that--talk. Their proposal places taxpayers first in line to bear the losses when the government invokes its resolution authority; and, for those who believe that those taxpayer losses will subsequently be recouped from surviving firms, I would direct their attention to the recent examples of GM, Chrysler, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and AIG, and the even more recent example of GMAC, where the prospects for full taxpayer reimbursement are fanciful. In fact, in testimony before this committee last month, former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker warned that a resolution authority with the power to lend or provide money would encourage the ``too-big-to-fail'' syndrome. Although he advises the Obama Administration, his caution has been rejected in this draft. And in an attempt to naming the institutions it deems ``too-big-to-fail,'' the Administration's legislative proposal foregoes the transparency and full disclosure that are the hallmark of America's capital markets. In the place of an open process, it substitutes a regulatory regime built around a secret list of ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions. It is foolish to assume such a list will be kept secret. Are we so gullible as to believe that the regulatory authorities for eight government agencies will be able to impose increased capital requirements and a host of other regulatory constraints on the so-called identified firms without market participants quickly figuring out which firms are on the list? Are companies expected to treat this information as immaterial for purposes of filing reports with the SEC? Until these questions are answered, it's simply irresponsible for this committee to accept such a foundation on premise and move forward with this legislation. The Administration's desire to get something, anything done to satisfy some arbitrary deadline imposed on the chairman will result in this committee passing a product that has not received the careful deliberation necessary to ensure sound legislation. Mr. Chairman, is it too much to ask the members of this committee and the people they represent that they have enough time to read and understand the far-reaching implications of this legislation? In conclusion, this committee's haste also stands in marked contrast to the views expressed by Federal Reserve Vice Chairman Donald Kohn, who said: ``I hope we build a regulatory structure that's good for a couple of decades and it's worth taking our time to get it right. The economy is fragile, and we learned this morning that it continues to lose jobs. We need to promote job creation and growth--not more uncertainty.'' I share Vice Chairman Kohn's hope that we fulfill our obligation to do this in a deliberative manner, not the haste that we are witnessing this morning. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 2 minutes."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I understand that we are under pressure to get some things done, and unfortunately we have not had a great deal of time to spend in analyzing this proposition. I wanted to address my remarks simply to the Secretary that in his presentation can help us out. I discern that there is a great interest in America for us to have this type of power at the Federal level to prevent future disasters of the kind we have experienced within the last year; but, I also feel that the American people are speaking to this Congress and very broadly to the world that they cannot understand how we just support the safety mechanisms for the bailout and cannot put caps or limitations on the huge conglomerations of money that we are causing by our own very bailout. It seems to me that if Treasury was able to come up with proposals like this, they also should have the burden and at this time use this offer as a balancing act to come up with the mechanism in place so that we can act to start limiting the unlimited power of the Goldman Sachs of the world and other huge conglomerations of money. And that may sound strange. It may sound revolutionary, but we are almost in revolutionary times. But, clearly, if Treasury and the Executive Branch have come to the conclusion that the danger to our system was so great that we have to use the Interstate Commerce Clause to create tremendous executive authority without much restraint. I just read the chairman's letter and I think he makes some good points in his letter. If we are going to have that kind of a transfer of authority, it seems to me it is the obligation of Treasury to come forth and say how we are going to prevent this, so this never happens again in the future, by really curtailing and tailoring down the size of the institutions, particularly the financial institutions of this country so that we do not have systemic risk."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. I am going to go to a couple of members on the Republican side, because we have just a spattering of people. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer, for 1 minute."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you. I thank Secretary Geithner and Chairman Frank for their work on this new draft. While they have addressed some of the concerns raised from prior proposals, the overall concept doesn't seem to have changed much. This draft will still allow regulators to identify firms that are ``too-big-to-fail,'' although those firms will now be kept secret. This version still keeps the government in the bailout business while a line of credit for the taxpayers will be used, and may or may not be paid back. These two ideas for me are non-starters. Rather than an arbitrary, government-run resolution, we need a stronger bankruptcy process that holds firms and creditors to the rule of law. Rather than picking winners and losers behind closed doors, the council should require regulators to look at risks across financial entities and review capital requirements to ensure that all firms are holding the necessary capital for the risk that they are taking. We need a reform plan that puts the taxpayers and the economies first rather than making bailouts permanent. And, like the ranking member, I think this process needs to be slowed down some, because these are probably some of the more important things that we'll do on this committee in the next few months, and we need to get it right. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California, Mr. Royce."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Apparently, the ``too- big-to-fail'' model is ``too-hard-to-kill.'' I thought we would have learned our lesson from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Prior to their failure, it was widely perceived that the government would be there to bail them out when they ran into trouble. That implicit guarantee translated into real advantages for the GSEs in terms of lower cost of capital which facilitated their dominance in the marketplace. The explicit backstop already provided to the largest of our financial institutions is having an eerily similar effect. A recent study by the Center of Economic and Policy Research found that the ``too-big-to-fail'' doctrine has translated into a tangible subsidy for the 18 largest bank holding companies worth $34 billion per year with a 78 basis points lower cost of capital when compared to their smaller competitors. Instead of granting permanent bailout authority and institutionalized in the ``too-big-to-fail'' doctrine which this legislation does, we should set up a structure that will allow for an orderly liquidation of an institution through an enhanced bankruptcy without the use of government funds. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Illinois, Ms. Biggert, for 1 minute."
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My initial review of the chairman and Secretary's financial stability plan is that it would do the complete opposite: create further financial instability; and facilitate risky behavior in financial firms. And while the headlines have said that a deal has been reached, I would argue that this is no deal for the American people and especially the taxpayers. While I support a strong council of regulators, including Federal and State regulators at the table, and I support stronger and smarter regulation, I don't think that the resolution authority under this proposal is the right answer. It is my hope that instead of supporting more proposals to increase the power of the Federal Government, the Administration will strongly consider a new chapter to the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, it is my hope that we can also consider proposals addressing two of the biggest financial failures of our time: Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Never again can we allow regulators to fall asleep at the wheel or another bailout, or the government picking winners and losers of private businesses. I yield back."
"The Chairman","I will yield myself 5 minutes. We are in a difficult situation. History has apparently been somewhat rewritten. All of the bailouts that the gentleman from Alabama referred to, where we are not going to get money back, were the result of an absence of policies to deal with this set of situations; and, every one of those bailouts was of course requested by the Bush Administration, by Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke. Now, as of April 2008, Secretary Paulson said we needed to do some things to keep this from happening. It happened very quickly, and we were unable to avoid those. The question of simply allowing bankruptcy to be the way to deal with it, there's nothing theoretical about that. That's the Lehman Brothers situation. The Lehman Brothers went bankrupt and the Bush Administration officials had two responses: first, to use Federal Reserve authority without any congressional approval, and even prior notification, to begin the process of providing funds to pay off the creditors of AIG. That was done by the Federal Reserve last September under the Bush Administration with no congressional involvement other than to be told after the fact. Second, they came and asked us for authority to spend some money to provide some forms of cash so other institutions didn't go under. Congress agreed with some conditions, I think, and avoided worse dangers. It could have been administered better. Our whole purpose today was to change that situation and to prevent it. Yes, it is true that we had these previous problems. That's because we didn't have a set of rules. What we do today is to begin deliberation on a proposal that does. There are two problems that were raised with regard to the bailouts: one, the use of taxpayer money; and this is a set of proposals that will prevent taxpayer money from being used. Members say, ``Oh, this requirement that it come from the financial industry, that won't work. Congress will do it instead.'' They have a very different Congress in mind than the one I have served in. I do not believe there is any remote chance that Congress would come to the rescue of the financial industry that this bill will have required and said substitute taxpayer money. If that's their intention, they can try. I think they will be outvoted if they feel that's what has to happen. Secondly, there is the moral argument. There is the argument that once people know that certain institutions are of a certain size, they'll be protected. That's why many of us protected the notion that there will be a list published beforehand. What we have here is this. A group of regulators that will be monitoring institutional behavior, both cumulative institutional behavior, like subprime loans, and the behavior of a large, irresponsible institution like AIG. There will be no notification to the public or privately that a particular institution is in that category without simultaneous restrictions on the institution. There will be no prior notification, so the institution will then be free to attract investment, because it will be shown to be so big. It will become manifested. This institution is covered. The day that the regulator says you must significantly increase your capital, you must reduce your activity. We will be adding to this. It's in here--an ability to take the kind of restrictions that existed under Glass-Steagall nationwide and impose them institution by institution. Now, there is a threshold question. Is it possible to go forward in this situation without any funds ever being used to prevent the kind of cataclysm of failure leading to failure leading to failure that the Bush Administration felt very much we had to avoid. We, I think, minimized this in a couple of ways. First of all, the penalty for being such an institution will be very severe. There will be death panels enacted by Congress this year, I hope, but they will be for those large institutions, which will be put out of business, whose shareholders will be wiped out, whose executors will be fired, whose boards of directors will be replaced. There will also be no guarantee in any case that the creditors are going to receive 100 cents on a dollar. Classes of creditors will be allowed to be exempted entirely from any repayment. Other creditors will have it reduced. You can't do that under bankruptcy. General bankruptcy makes it harder to have that kind of thoughtful selection. We are using the constitutional power of bankruptcy, but in a way that is more thoughtful. Finally, I would say this: This is not the only piece. We are regulating derivatives over the objection of my Republican colleagues. I hope we will be imposing some restrictions on your ability to securitize 100 percent of the loan. We are doing other things. We are requiring other people to register. There will be other restrictions that will keep us from getting to that situation. And, now, I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, for 1 minute."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I find it somewhat curious that we are having a hearing on systemic regulation, and nowhere do I see the Director of the FHFA, the regulator of Fannie and Freddie, the same Fannie and Freddie that were compelled to buy the lion's share of poorly underwritten loans in this Nation; the same Fannie and Freddie that have now cost the taxpayer over $1 trillion. The Administration has now submitted to us legislation to regulate pawnshops and grocery stores, but no legislation dealing with the greatest systemic risk within the system: Fannie and Freddie. The bill we are considering today will simply institutionalize ``too-big-to-fail,'' paving the way for more Fannies and Freddies in perpetual taxpayer bailouts. According to the Wall Street Journal, the Administration is not done with taxpayer funded bailouts, as apparently GMAC is now in for their third multi-billion-dollar bailout. To borrow from a title of the song from the Commodores: ``Once, Twice, Three Times a bailout;'' enough is enough. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett, for 1 minute."
"Mr. Garrett","Mr. Chairman, I seek unanimous consent to enter into the record the statement by Congressman Brad Sherman regarding, ``Let's Not Adopt TARP On Steroids,'' an appropriate analysis of exactly what this legislation stands for."
"The Chairman","Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. Garrett","Okay. Thank you. And secondly, I wish to enter into this record the ``Congressional Record'' from the day in which the TARP legislation was passed by this House of Congress and indicate in that day of the ``Congressional Record'' that the chairman was the manager of that legislation as it passed through a Democratic Congress, without objection."
"The Chairman","Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. Garrett","There you go. Thank you. Mr. Chairman, do I begin my time now?"
"The Chairman","Start the minute now."
"Mr. Garrett","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I find this legislation draft proposal, which is a continuation of bailout legislation, absolutely incredible. Over the last several months, it was my impression that there was a developing consensus that the Federal Reserve should be given less power and not more. But in reading over this discussion draft in the very limited time that we have had to review probably the most important legislation the members of this committee will ever consider in our lifetimes, I am just struck by how much power the Federal Reserve is given. Although it is not singled out as a systemic uber-regulator in name, don't anyone be fooled. This Fed is given primary supervision over systemic firms and can override lesser regulators that don't comply with its wishes. In the name of mitigating systemic risk, the Fed is given almost unlimited authority to systemically dismantle a private company. This is a lot more than imposing capital standards. I for one, given the extraordinary government intervention into private firms we have already seen with the trampling of the rule of law in order to benefit some political favorites in the auto industry, for instance, I am very uncomfortable with giving this sweeping, unchecked power to the same entity that failed to effectively mitigate many of the large bank holding companies already under its purview. Thank you."
"The Chairman","The Secretary of the Treasury is now recognized for his statement. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE TIMOTHY F. GEITHNER, SECRETARY, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY"," "
"Secretary Geithner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It's a pleasure to be here again. I want to begin with a few comments on the economy. Today, we learned that our economy is growing again. In the third quarter of this year, the economy grew at an annual rate of 3.5 percent, the first time we have seen positive growth in a year, and the strongest growth in 2 years. Business and consumer confidence has improved substantially since the end of last year. House prices are rising. The value of American savings has increased substantially. Americans are now saving more and we are borrowing much less from the rest of the world. Consumers are just starting to spend again. Businesses are starting to see orders increase. Exports are expanding. And these improvements are the direct result of the tax cuts and investments that were part of the Recovery Act and the actions we have taken to stabilize the financial system and unfreeze credit markets. But, this is just the beginning. Unemployment remains unacceptably high. For every person out of work, for every family facing foreclosure, for every small business facing a credit crunch, the recession remains alive and acute. Growth will bring jobs, but we need to continue working together to strengthen the recovery and create the conditions where businesses will invest again and all Americans will have the confidence that they can provide for their families, send their kids to college, feel secure in retirement. And we have a responsibility as part of that to create a financial system that is more fair and more stable, one that provides protections for consumers and investors, and gives businesses access to the capital they need to grow. That brings me to the topic at hand. This committee has made enormous progress in the past several weeks. In the face of a substantial opposition, you have acted swiftly to lay the foundation for far-reaching reforms that would better protect consumers and investors from unfair, fraudulent investment lending practices to regulate the derivatives market, to improve investor protection, to reform credit rating agencies, to improve the securitization markets, and to bring basic oversight to hedge funds and other unregulated activities. Today, you carry this momentum forward. One of the most searing lessons of last fall is that no financial system can work if institutions and investors assume that the government will protect them from the consequences of failure. Never again should taxpayers be put in the position of having to pay for the losses of private institutions. We need to build a system in which individual firms, no matter how large or important, can fail without risking catastrophic damage to the economy. Last June, we outlined a comprehensive set of proposals to achieve this goal. There has been a lot of work by this committee and many others since then. The chairman has introduced new legislation to accomplish that. We believe any effective set of reforms has to have five key elements. I am going to outline those very, very quickly, but I want to say that the legislation, in our judgment, meets that test. The first test is the government has to have the ability to resolve failing major financial institutions in an orderly manner with losses absorbed not by taxpayers, but by equity holders and by unsecured creditors. In all but the rarest cases, bankruptcy will remain the dominant tool for handling financial failure, but as the collapse of Lehman Brothers demonstrates, the Bankruptcy Code is not an effective tool for resolving the failure of complicated global financial institutions in times of severe stress. Under the proposals we provided, which are very similar to what already exists for banks and thrifts, a failing firm will be placed into an FDIC-managed receivership so they can be unwound, dismantled, sold or liquidated in an orderly way. Stakeholders of the firm would absorb losses. Managers responsible for failure would be replaced. A second key element of reform: any individual firm that puts itself in the position where it cannot survive without special assistance from the government must face the consequences of that failure. That's why this proposed resolution authority would be limited to facilitating the orderly demise of the failing firm, not ensuring its survival. It's not about redemption for the firm that makes mistakes. It's about unwinding them in a way that doesn't cause catastrophic damage to the economy. Third key point: Taxpayers must not be on the hook for losses resulting from failure and subsequent resolution of a large financial firm. The government should have the authority, as it now does, when we resolve small banks and thrifts. The government should have the authority to recoup any losses by assessing a fee on other financial institutions. These assessments should be stretched out over time as necessary to avoid amplifying adding to the pressures you face in crisis. Fourth key point, and I want to emphasize this: The emergency authorities now granted to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, should be limited so that they are subject to appropriate checks and balances and can be only used to protect the system as a whole. Final element: The government has to have stronger supervisory and regulatory authority over these major firms. They need to be empowered with explicit authority to force major institutions to reduce their size or restrict the scope of their activities, where that is necessary to reduce risks to the system. And this is a critically important tool we do not have at present. Regulators must be able to impose tougher requirements, most critically, stronger capital rules, more stringent liquidity requirements that would reduce the probability that major financial institutions in the future would take on a scale of size and leverage that could threaten the stability of the financial system. This would provide strong incentives for firms to shrink simply to reduce leverage. We have to close loopholes, reduce the possibilities for gaming the system, for avoiding these strong standards. So monitoring threats to stability will fall to the responsibility of this new financial services oversight council. The council would have the obligation and the authority to identify any firm whose size and leverage and complexity creates a risk to the system as a whole and needs to be subject to heightened, stronger standards, stronger constraints on leverage. The Federal Reserve under this model would oversee individual financial firms so that there's a clear, inescapable, single point of accountability. The Fed already provides this role for major banks, bank holding companies, but it needs to provide the role for any firm that creates that potential risk to the system as a whole. The rules in place today are inadequate and they are outdated. We have all seen what happens, when in a crisis the government is left with inadequate tools to respond to data damage. That is a searing lesson of last fall. In today's markets, capital moves at unimaginable speeds. When the system was created more than 90 years ago, and today's economy given these risks requires we bring that framework into the 21st Century. The bill before the committee does that. It's the comprehensive, coordinated answer to the moral hazard problem we are also concerned about. What it does not do is provide a government guarantee for troubled financial firms. It does not create a fixed list of systemically important firms. It does not create permanent TARP authority; and, it does not give the government broad discretion to step in and rescue insolvent firms. We are looking forward. We are looking to make sure we provide future Administrations and future Congresses with better options than existed last year. This is still an extremely sensitive moment in the financial system. Investors across the country and around the world are watching very carefully your deliberations, our debate, our discussions; and, I want to make sure they understand that these reforms we're proposing are about preventing the crises of the future, while we work to repair the damage still caused by the current crisis. The American people are counting on us to get this right and to get this done. I want to compliment you again for the enormous progress you made already and I look forward to continuing to work with you to produce a strong package of reforms. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Secretary Geithner can be found on page 150 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","I want to begin and use my 5 minutes essentially to make some points. I know there will be no dearth of questions, Mr. Secretary. So while I will not be asking you any questions, I do not think you will feel ignored by the end of this morning. First, let me address the timing issue. The ideas that we are talking about here really were first formulated for major public debate by former Treasury Secretary Paulson in April of 2008, and they have been under serious discussion since then. Various versions have gone forward. This particular draft, reflecting a lot of conversations a lot of people have had was recently released. We won't get to mark it up until next week, and probably not until Wednesday now, because we have a couple of things to finish up from Tuesday. The argument that we should wait, we are more open to the criticism that we haven't moved quickly enough rather than we are moving too quickly in this. There was a paralysis in the financial system, but that is happily ending. And we don't want to get behind that curve. Second, I want to address the question of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. I am astounded by the notion that we have to regulate them. We did. In 2007, as chairman of this committee, I made as our first major order of business adopting the regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac that the Bush Administration wanted. We did that in the House. We did not get prompt action in the Senate, surprisingly, and when the first stimulus bill came up in January of 2008, I urged that they take our Fannie/Freddie reform, which was approved by the Bush Administration, and make it part of the bill. They weren't able to get agreement with themselves to do it. The Senate did act on our reform in 2008--too late to stall off the crisis--but the fact is that the Fannie and Freddie that exist today are already the ones that were strictly regulated. Now, they have collapsed. They are not acting as they did before. It is important for us going forward to totally revise the functions of the secondary market and whether or not the subsidy should be a part of that. That certainly will be on our agenda next year. But, Fannie and Freddie are not out there doing what they did before: (A) they are subject to regulation; and (B) there is a collapse. It is not a case that they are two unregulated entities working out. I think part of this debate suffers from serious cultural lag with a little partisan motivation. Next, I want to talk about the comparison between this year and last year. In the events leading up to the collapse of last year, there was no regulation of subprime lending, a major contributing factor. We adopted legislation to control subprime lending in the House. It didn't get enacted in the Senate. The Fed is still active. We have that as part of this bill. We will not have the unrestricted, unregulated, irresponsible subprime lending that led in part to the collapse because so many of the securities that fell apart were of that sort. We had no regulation of derivatives. AIG was engaged in wild speculation and these things all interact. You had bad subprime mortgages that shouldn't have been issued. Then you had AIG without any restriction ensuring against the default of these bad subprime mortgages. That again will be corrected by the time we go forward. We will have hedge fund registration, private equity registration, much more data collection than we had before. We, as I said, have Fannie and Freddie playing a very different role. You had an unregulated Fannie and Freddie before this House began the process of regulating for 2007. You had unregulated subprime mortgages. You had unregulated derivatives. All those things are now incorporated, so yes, we want to avoid the ``too-big-to-fail.'' Part of it is that we have restrictions here that will keep these institutions: (A) from getting too big; (B) from being likely to fail; and (C) having fewer consequences when they do. So the comparison of today to before, as I said, is serious cultural lag. We will have severely restricted the kind of irresponsible activity in derivatives in subprime lending; and another piece that I mentioned, in securitization. I myself think one of the biggest causes that happened here was that 30 years ago people who lent money to other people were the people who were expected to be paid back. Once they were able to get rid of all of those loans, the discipline of the lender-borrower relationship diminished, so we are severely--we are going to reform securitization with some risk retention. We are restricting irresponsible subprime loans. We are regulating derivatives. There will be no unregistered, large financial enterprises going forward. We will have the ability to significantly increase capital requirements, more than proportionally, so all of those things are there. Yes, in the absence of all of those, we had greater problems. We are talking about a regime that puts all those in a place and then in the end says, for all of that, somebody fails. We step in and we hammer them pretty hard and we protect the taxpayers. The gentleman from Alabama."
"Mr. Bachus","Secretary Geithner, this list of companies is to be kept secret? Is that correct?"
"Secretary Geithner","Congressman, the central imperative is to make sure that institutions that could threaten the stability of the system are held to tougher constraints on leverage and risk-taking."
"Mr. Bachus","And capital and prudential--"
"Secretary Geithner","Capital and liquidity--"
"Mr. Bachus","Yes--"
"Secretary Geithner","And risk-taking generally."
"Mr. Bachus","Right."
"Secretary Geithner","That's the central lesson of this crisis, the central imperative of reform. To do that, they have to know who they are. There should not be a fixed list. It may change over time, because the system changes over time. But the central imperative is, if you take on or could risk the stability of the system as a whole--"
"Mr. Bachus","But you have to designate, it has to come on a list, or it has to be designated, if you're going to increase capital on them, or prudential regulations, or--"
"Secretary Geithner","Exactly. And in some ways--"
"Mr. Bachus","So you will have a list. There will be these companies that you know of."
"Secretary Geithner","What I state is this--and this is the system that exists today, although it didn't work as well as it needs to--right now--"
"Mr. Bachus","I'm not talking about that, I'm just saying--"
"Secretary Geithner","No, but this is important. Right now, if you were a globally active bank, the capital requirements you are held to are different from and tougher than if you were a regional or community bank. So that's the system we have today. Now those banks know who they are, they exist, and they're designated as globally active banks."
"Mr. Bachus","I understand. But for instance, the SEC, these companies have to file with the SEC. They would have to make a material disclosure as to that they were--"
"Secretary Geithner","Yes. And it won't be a secret that they're held to tougher standards. It's very important that they are held to the tougher standards, and you know that they are held to the tougher standards."
"Mr. Bachus","So it will not be a secret?"
"Secretary Geithner","No, it can't be. Because again, they have to be--the purpose of it is so that they're held to tougher standards."
"Mr. Bachus","So if it is not a secret, then people will know. I think it's a given that people can figure out quite quickly, when you raise capital restraints, require more capital, that will be disclosed."
"Secretary Geithner","If they weren't held to higher capital requirements, we would be making a mistake. If they were held to it, but nobody knew it, it wouldn't do any good."
"Mr. Bachus","You say in this legislation that you can increase the capital requirements."
"Secretary Geithner","Of course, exactly. And that's why I think it's designed this way, and it's very appropriate."
"Mr. Bachus","And the market and the investors or shareholders, they'll know that in fact the companies would have to disclose that--"
"Secretary Geithner","Absolutely. Again, for the capital requirements, they have to exist to be tougher."
"Mr. Bachus","Right."
"Secretary Geithner","And the market will have to know they're held to tougher standards."
"Mr. Bachus","So the public would almost immediately realize who these companies were."
"Secretary Geithner","True. But Congressman, I think we're missing the key point. What you don't want to do is by identifying a list of companies that are going to be held to tougher standards, create an expectation that government will step in and protect them, if they screw up."
"Mr. Bachus","Well--"
"Secretary Geithner","It's a difficult balance. That's the balance you have to strike."
"Mr. Bachus","I know that you won't release--it says that there will not be a release of the companies on a list. Okay? But by putting new requirements on them, people will realize quite quickly, in fact those companies will have to disclose to investors and to the market, and to the SEC and other regulators that they're under those constraints."
"Secretary Geithner","I don't think we're disagreeing, Congressman. I think, if I understand you correctly, you're in favor of making sure that these firms can be held to higher standards. This is a way of doing that. And--"
"Mr. Bachus","No, and let me say this, I'm not in favor of them being held to higher standards. But if we are to hold them to higher standards, I think the market is going to have to know."
"Secretary Geithner","But you would not impose tougher standards on the largest, most risky institutions, than apply to a community bank or a regional bank?"
"Mr. Bachus","All right. Let me ask you this. I'm not, because what you then do, you say that you can loan these companies money."
"Secretary Geithner","No. I think that's a mischaracterization of this. What this does is makes sure, if in the future, they get themselves in the position where they can't survive on their own--"
"Mr. Bachus","Right--"
"Secretary Geithner","Then the only authority we would have is to manage their failure without causing the economy to go through what this economy went in this crisis. That's the basic--"
"Mr. Bachus","But under 1109, even a solvent company, you can have capital injections, you can invest in those institutions, you can buy their assets."
"Secretary Geithner","Again, Congressman, the important thing to recognize is--and it's just worth going back to what it was like last fall--without the ability for the government to step in and manage the failure of a large firm, and contain the risk of the fire spreading, we'll be consigned to repeat the experience of last fall. It's a stark simple thing. And I know of no person who has stood in my seat--this is true for Secretary Paulson--in any central bank in any major country, who would say the country should be run with no authority to step in and act in that case."
"Mr. Bachus","Let me ask you--"
"Secretary Geithner","I don't think there's any credible--"
"Mr. Bachus","Let me ask you this, Secretary--this will be my last question. You impose a tax on large and medium-sized financial institutions to--"
"Secretary Geithner","Only if, as part of protecting the system from their failure, the government is exposed to losses. In that case and only to that extent, would there be a fee assessed on the institutions to cover it."
"Mr. Bachus","But that's a tax on their competitors, is it not?"
"Secretary Geithner","But that's again--Mr. Kanjorski, can I borrow my time?"
"Mr. Kanjorski","A second, to finish."
"Secretary Geithner","Okay."
"Mr. Kanjorski","But no further questions."
"Secretary Geithner","Okay. This is a very important key thing. The system Congress designed for small banks and thrifts today works in a similar way. It's different because it's part of an explicit insurance regime. But in that case, if the government has to step in--and the FDIC does this every week, step in and manage the failure of a bank--if in that case, the government assumes any risk of loss, it has to put a fee on institutions to recoup that loss over time, so the taxpayer is protected. What we are doing is a very simple thing. We're taking that basic framework, and we're adapting it to the system we have today. We should have done that 10 years ago, but we didn't do it. But it's a very simple thing. If the government is exposed to loss when it acts to protect the system--any risk of loss-- it should assess a fee on banks over time to recoup that loss. That's to make sure the taxpayer is not in the position of absorbing those losses. That's the basic premise."
"Mr. Bachus","Of course, I think we all know that what they do now is--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentleman's time has expired."
"Mr. Bachus","A fee on the insured deposit is what it is--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentleman's--"
"Secretary Geithner","No, it goes beyond that."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Look, time has expired, and the Chair is going to ask for cooperation here."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. Thank you."
"Mr. Kanjorski","All right. And now the Chair is going to take its time, 10 minutes, right? No, I'm serious. "
"Mr. Kanjorski","I am going to follow up on the questions that the ranking members asked. If I listened to what he was saying--and I that your answers were off the point, Mr. Secretary--he is asking you on what authority is this extraordinary centralization of executive authority contained? Do you have some particular provision of the Constitution that says that this Congress has a right to transfer this amount of authority to the Executive Branch of Government? And that should be a pertinent question that we all address. There are a lot of things in this country we would like to do, should do, or could do to protect the people. But there is a little document that they executed some 233 years ago or 223 years ago, that does not allow us to do that. Now what is the basis for your authority?"
"Secretary Geithner","It's--you can just look at the system today, and I think there's--I'm not a lawyer, and of course our lawyers would love a chance to study this very carefully--but Congressman, right now, the Congress grants to a series of agencies created by the Congress the authority to set capital requirements on banks."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Yes."
"Secretary Geithner","And right now, the Congress has given the Executive Branch the authority for banks and thrifts--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","Mr. Secretary, I agree with that."
"Secretary Geithner","Yes."
"Mr. Kanjorski","But that is because those institutions exercise the right of being insured under statutes that this Congress has passed."
"Secretary Geithner","No, it's not solely because of that, because the protections that exist today that Congress has given the Executive Branch the authority or the responsibility for executing go beyond simply the explicit insurance of deposits."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Mr. Secretary, I am not a man who fears this Administration or you. But I do fear the accumulation of power exercised by someone in the future that can be extraordinary. Now you and I know that in this last disaster, Treasury was able to determine that General Motors and the auto industry were banks, financial institutions, so they could have access to TARP. I am not sure I agree with that. But at the time, it was certainly essential, if we were going to save those institutions. But what we are doing is allowing a board or council, or organization to make determinations in a time of extremity--no question about that--that some of us may not agree that authority rests in those entities, or was constituted, or we even had the authority in this Congress to give that type of authority."
"Secretary Geithner","You get to choose now what mix of authorities and limits and executive power are going to be appropriate for the future. That's the choice you're going to be debating and making. Now, then, what we propose, though, has a very carefully designed set of checks and balances, and it does limit very substantially the authority of the Executive Branch. But again, that's the choice you'll have to make in that case. But we're using a model that exists today, building on that model."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Okay. I am going to make the assumption you have the authority, your lawyers have said you have the authority, you have a good constitutional basis. If you do, what is our excuse for not exercising that same type of authority to stop these ``too-big-to-fail'' organizations from occurring and existing? Why can you not in this legislation say, ``No, this bank is just too large, it has to cut up and split up,'' with authority? Why should the American people have to sit out there and see us creating mammoth organizations that nobody says we have the authority to control or limit, but we have the authority to help them when they get into trouble?"
"Secretary Geithner","I agree with you, and that's why this bill would provide authority to not just impose higher capital requirements on them, constraints and leverage; it would have the authority to limit the scope of their activities, to compel them to shrink and separate. That is a very important thing, and I agree with you about, and I think the chairman does too."
"Mr. Kanjorski","You believe we have the authority, or you will under this bill have the authority to preemptively seize these corporations, and take them under the control of Federal authority, with no judgment, no due process, or no thought on their part?"
"Secretary Geithner","No. I think you need to separate two different things. One is about prevention, and it's what about what you do in the event of a severe crisis. On the prevention front, what this does is make it clear that regulators would have the responsibility and the authority to limit risk-taking, limit the scale and scope of activities, size if necessary, if that's necessary to protect the system. That's a very important thing. We did not have that in this crisis for a large part of the financial system. That fixes that."
"Mr. Kanjorski","So let me understand. You are interpreting this statute to give Treasury the authority to look at an organization that is not in difficulty or extreme, but is huge; and potentially it is not determined to be monopolistic at this point, but it is huge and could have systemic risk characteristics to it that you have the right to summarily seize that organization--"
"Secretary Geithner","No, no--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","Disband the assets of that organization--"
"Secretary Geithner","No, no, no, no. That--you're slightly conflating two different things. It gives the responsible regulatory authority--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","There are some organizations that have no regulators. General Motors did not have a regulator until you came in and interpreted that it was a bank."
"Secretary Geithner","That wasn't my judgment, that was my predecessor's judgment--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","I understand. But then do you sustain what judgment was made there, that in fact, it was a bank and subject to Federal Government regulation?"
"Secretary Geithner","Congressman, again, I don't think that's quite the right way to think about that. Again, that was a judgment made by my predecessor under authority given to him by the Congress, under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. I think he made the right judgment there, but that was his judgment, in that context."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Okay."
"Secretary Geithner","But I don't think that's what this bill is about."
"Mr. Kanjorski","I wish we had more time, Mr. Secretary. We don't--"
"Secretary Geithner","We will--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","But we certainly should engage in the future. And if I could make a recommendation that we perhaps break down into sections with this committee on both sides, so some of these questions, fundamental questions, should be answered. Mr. Neugebauer, you are recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Yes. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to go back to a little bit of what the ranking member was talking about, Mr. Secretary, because I'm a little confused now. On page 11, Confidentiality, ``The Committee of the Congress, receiving Council's report, shall maintain the confidentiality of the identity of the companies described in accordance with paragraph A3, the information relating to dispute resolutions described in accordance with paragraph''-- Then I'll go over to page, I believe it is 17, and it says, ``The Council and the Board''--which is the Fed--``may not publicly release a list of companies identified under this section.'' And what they're talking about is the identification of financial companies for heightened prudential standards for financial stability purposes. So what are those companies? The determination for those companies would be their capital structure, number one. And those would be categorized into well-capitalized, which we hope all companies are well-capitalized--but then we have undercapitalized, significantly uncapitalized, and critically undercapitalized companies. And the council is going to make, I guess along with their prudential regulator, make that decision of what categories they fall into. And you're telling me that you're going to disclose that information? The bill says you can't disclose that information. And I'm a little concerned about what is the answer to the question? Yes or no?"
"Secretary Geithner","I guess we can start with a simple thing. It does make sense to the system in which community banks and regional banks are held to the same standards that are necessary to protect the system from the risk posed by large complicated financial institutions. You need to have a different regime, tougher set of constraints applied to them, because they pose more risk--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","Mr. Secretary, with the different regimes, I just want to know, are going to disclose the companies or not? And are you going to disclose the--"
"Secretary Geithner","But you have to start with this thing. They need to be subject to a different set of constraints. I have heard nobody suggest that what's appropriate for a community bank is appropriate for a major global firm. Now, if that's true--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","Leave the banks out of it. Let's just talk about the large banks."
"Secretary Geithner","If that's true, then they have to subject to higher standards, and I am sure, for the reasons many of you have said, they will be disclosing the regime they're operating under to their creditors, their equity holders. Analysts will know. And it will be clear how much capital they're holding. And I think that's the best way to get the balance right. Again, what you want to avoid, I think--as many of you said in the past--is you want to have the sense there's a fixed list of companies out there, that are going to benefit from special support. We want to avoid that risk. And that's why the chairman tried to strike the balance in the draft the way it's done."
"Mr. Neugebauer","I want to reclaim my time, because there will have to be a list, this bill calls for a list to be determined, because that's the council's responsibility."
"Secretary Geithner","Would you prefer it be a public list?"
"Mr. Neugebauer","I think we have to decide, because I don't know how you can keep it secret, because these companies--if I'm a creditor or a shareholder of a company, and it's not disclosed to me that I'm investing in a company that's critically undercapitalized--does the government have some fiduciary responsibility that--"
"Secretary Geithner","I think--"
"Mr. Neugebauer","You're withholding information from--"
"Secretary Geithner","I'm not sure we're disagreeing. I think that the company will be held to tougher standards. It will have to disclose how much capital it holds. The analysts that cover it, its creditors, its equity holders will understand that. And that's probably the right way to get the balance."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Where I'm headed with this is that the resolution now that is proposed under this bill basically doesn't necessarily--and we haven't in some of the resolution of these entities followed what would be the rule of law--and in the sense that certain creditors were given preferences in, for example, GM. Or they were intimidated into taking a position that they didn't necessarily want to take."
"Secretary Geithner","Now GM was managed under the established bankruptcy procedures of the laws of the land. The Congress recognized many, many years ago that those procedures do not work for banks, because banks borrow short, they take on leverage, they cannot function effectively under that kind of regime. Thus, a different regime, very much modeled on the Bankruptcy Code, that establishes clear priorities for creditors. But again, that system exists today for banks and thrifts."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Why not--"
"Secretary Geithner","Now--"
"Mr. Neugebauer","Why not just go ahead and use the Bankruptcy Code as a Republican alternative, and set up a special--"
"Secretary Geithner","But if you--again, I don't think this is complicated. Look what happened to Lehman, in the wake of Lehman. Bankruptcy Code was the only option available in that context. It caused catastrophic damage. That's why in the wake of the S&L crisis--and actually well before that--Congress recognized that for banks, and they operate like banks, they need to have a special set of protections to allow for the equivalent of bankruptcy."
"Mr. Neugebauer","But had we had a different provision in the Bankruptcy Code for a Lehman-like or financial institution, we could have done that and made sure that--"
"Secretary Geithner","That is effectively what this does. That is effectively what this is designed to do."
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentleman's time has expired. And now we will recognize the gentlelady from California,"
"Ms. Waters",""
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me ask Mr. Geithner, do you have a list of systematically significant organizations that are basically in the definition of ``too-big-to-fail?'' Do you have a defined list?"
"Secretary Geithner","I do not have a defined list today. But I want to come back to one thing. Right now the way the--"
"Ms. Waters","Excuse me, please. I just want to know that. Secondly, in this legislation, where you're asking for broad authority, do you have authority to bail out, to rescue--"
"Secretary Geithner","In this proposal?"
"Ms. Waters","Yes."
"Secretary Geithner","What this proposal does--"
"Ms. Waters","Just, do you have the authority to spend money to bail out any of these systemically significant organizations after they get in trouble? Not just resolution authority to break them up and to assign the management of their failed assets, etc., etc. Do you have the authority to spend the taxpayers' money to bail them out if you deem that to be a good way of handling that situation?"
"Secretary Geithner","No."
"Ms. Waters","Describe what authority you have to resolve them, if you don't have bailout authority."
"Secretary Geithner","What you have is the authority to wind them down, to separate the bad from the good. To sell the good businesses, to put them out of existence in a way that doesn't cause catastrophic damage to the economy. And if in that process, the taxpayer is exposed to any losses, then we propose to recoup those losses, as we do now for banks and thrifts, by imposing a fee on banks--"
"Ms. Waters","Okay. I think I have the answer. You're not asking for any monetary bailout authority, as you do the resolving of any of these systemically significant institutions. That's what you're saying."
"Secretary Geithner","We want the ability to let them fail, without the taxpayer being exposed to losses."
"Ms. Waters","You're not asking for the authority to bail them out. Okay, I got that. Have you suggested to any of these systemically significant organizations that they should be winding down the size of their organizations? We know that AIG, for example, started to sell off, started to wind down. You have to some systemically significant organizations that are in trouble now. Citi is in trouble. What are you suggesting they do?"
"Secretary Geithner","I would be happy to go into detail as to what I think the Chairman of the Fed--and go through exactly the conditions that have been put on a range of institutions to make sure they emerge from this safe, and not relying on the taxpayers' money. But I want to emphasize one very important thing. Since I came into office, we have had $70 billion of capital taken back out of the financial system, replaced with private capital. The financial system has changed very dramatically. Those major institutions are smaller, they have less leverage today, they are beginning to run more safely. The riskier part of their business has been wound down very dramatically, and it's a very important--"
"Ms. Waters","All right. I want to take back my time. But the question really is this, if you know who they are, and there is a possibility they could cause the same kind of meltdown that we have experienced in this economy, have you suggested, before they get into trouble again, that they should be downsizing, they should be selling off--"
"Secretary Geithner","Exactly, of course--"
"Ms. Waters","They should be reducing their size?"
"Secretary Geithner","Of course, absolutely."
"The Chairman","Will the gentlewoman yield to me for 10 seconds?"
"Ms. Waters","Yes."
"The Chairman","I do want to say precisely the purpose of this bill is to give them powers to do more of that than they now have. They do not have the powers in a binding way to do exactly what the gentlewoman is suggesting. And this bill would give them more powers to make those not just as suggestions, but as binding orders."
"Secretary Geithner","Before they need money from the government."
"Ms. Waters","Let me just finish. As we take a look at what has happened in the past, with the bailout that we have supported, and we have found that these institutions that we bailed out, froze the credit, didn't make credit available, they increased interest rates, they did all of that, perhaps we had the power to put some mandates on them, some dictates on them about what they should do in exchange for getting the bailout. For example, our small regional community banks don't have capital now. And you say to them, ``You have to go out and you have to get capital, or we're going to close you down.'' Or FDIC or somebody says that. And we have bailed out some of these big banks, who are now richer. Goldman Sachs is a lot richer, because we bailed them out. Banks lend money to each other, but they're not lending money to the small community banks and regional banks and minority banks. What can you do, or what have you done to make that happen?"
"Secretary Geithner","Congresswoman, this is a very important issue. Small businesses are much more reliant on credit from banks, including small banks. For again, to get that credit, banks have to have the capital they need to lend. The President proposed last week two important new initiatives to make sure small banks can get that capital, as well as community development and finance institutions as well. And I think Congress needs to work with us to help make those banks more comfortable, coming to get capital from the government. If they do that, then they'll have a better capacity to provide credit to small businesses. And we think that's a very important thing to do. The Congress also passed in the Recovery Act some important changes to help encourage small business lending by the SBA. Lending by the SBA since those actions were taken has increased very dramatically. But I think you're absolutely right that for many small businesses across the country, they're still not getting the credit they need to grow and expand. And we need to work with you to try to fix that problem."
"The Chairman","This is obviously a very important question; let me just reinforce what the gentlewoman said. Absent the addressing of this, I think we will have a great deal of problems going forward in any broad way. The gentleman from California, I believe, is next."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Geithner, I asked you about a provision in your White Paper earlier this year, and I would come back to that. And that's this idea of providing direct funding to an operating institution to keep it from failing. Such authority of course, we would be markedly different from a resolution authority that would entail an orderly unwinding of a failed firm. Some have compared this idea that's in the White Paper to the open bank assistance authority at the FDIC. It appears as though you've maintained this idea in the discussion draft that was issued earlier this week. And I would ask, is it your belief, should this legislation become law, that the government should have the authority to prop up an operating institution with Federal dollars, without ever unwinding it?"
"Secretary Geithner","And my answer to that is no. But let me--it's a little more complicated than that. You need two authorities we don't have today. One is for a large institution that is courting failure and whose failure could cause catastrophic damage, you need to be able to act and unwind them with less damage to the economy, without the taxpayers being exposed to loss. We don't have that authority today; thus the traumatic damaging experience of last fall. You also need to make sure that you can protect solvent, liquid institutions in the rest of the system from losing their capacity to operate and fund. In classic financial panics, what happens is the weakness of one spreads to the strong. You need to arrest that to contain panics to fix panics. And that's why in this bill there is some authority reserved for the Fed and the FDIC to contain the risk of panic spreading to healthy institutions. We propose to limit that authority, relative to what exists today. But you need to have both those provisions for it to work."
"Mr. Royce","But under that interpretation, the government would have the authority to prop up that operating institution with Federal dollars, without unwinding it, because of your presumption at some point that you're eventually going to be able to restabilize it. I think--"
"Secretary Geithner","No, I wouldn't--that's not quite right. Think of a world in which you have one bank that is large and complicated and can no longer survive without government assistance. And you have the rest of the system that is still relatively strong and healthy. What you want to do is take that one institution that managed itself to the edge of the abyss, and you want to put it out of the existence safely. Now you can't flip a switch and do that. It's a complicated task. In Continental Illinois, it took 10 years. But you have to have the capacity to do that as quickly as you can and safely. But you need to make sure the rest of the system does not suffer a calamitous loss of funding--"
"Mr. Royce","But there's--"
"Secretary Geithner","And you need that basic--it's like a firebreak kind of--"
"Mr. Royce","Right, I understand your argument on that. Part of the problem here are the unintended consequences. And unless we set very clear parameters on this authority, we run the risk of the market really interpreting the worst here. Let me give you an example, and this has to do with moral hazard. It was often stated by several individuals, including members of this committee, that the government would not bail out Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac when they ran into trouble. But because there was a level of ambiguity, the market perceived these institutions as government-backed. At times, we asserted they were not, but the market perceived that they were, which, by the way, turned out to be the case. Economists pointed this out at the time. With respect to the chairman's comments, it's true that several members often raise the example of Fannie and Freddie. We do this not simply because the GSEs were at the center of the mortgage market meltdown--and I feel they were. When you put a mandate from Congress that one half of your portfolio has to be either Alt-A or subprime, when you manage to bully the system into a way where you have zero downpayment loans and so forth, and when it ends up being 85 percent of the losses of these institutions, I think you can see how some of us would believe that played a large role in the market turning into a bubble. I think that many in the Fed believed it did too. And I think, going back to what happened over on the Senate side, the fact that Senate Democrats blocked the real reforms that passed the Senate Banking Committee, on a party-line vote, and I think the fact that Fannie's and Freddie's political pull prevented real reforms during the years--because I certainly saw them up here, lobbying against the reforms that would be necessary to deleverage these institutions until it was too late--I think we can see out of that how we ended up with moral hazard in the system. And creating more GSEs would compound that problem."
"The Chairman","A brief response, if you wish?"
"Secretary Geithner","I believe I agree with you. You cannot allow a system to be created again where institutions exist and operate with the expectation there will be government support if they mismanage themselves to the extent they can't survive with that. That's the central lesson of this crisis, and the central responsibility that we have to make sure that doesn't happen. And that requires us to make sure we have strong constraints on risk-taking and leverage, and we limit dramatically any expectation of government support."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Illinois."
"Mr. Gutierrez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, Secretary Geithner and Chairman Frank, I think the proposal is really a step in the right direction in terms of imposing the tougher standards, in terms of the constraints, in terms of allowing us to create a system that will prevent to the extent humanly possible the kind of calamity that we have suffered already. And to that extent, let's move forward, let's get that job done. That's the last piece that we need to get done. We have done a lot of work here, and we really need to this last piece done. It's really not my issue here this morning or with the proposal. The main issue with the proposal is that we have this reckless and dangerous and risky behavior, which we have no evidence is going to cease to exist. So we should assume that Wall Street and those on Wall Street, the Goldman Sachs of the world, are going to continue to conduct themselves and behave as they have in the past. And so therefore, we have these new powers and this new regime to constrain them. But we also know that they were great at getting around those constraints in the past. We also know that, with all due respect to you, that in the past, we had one CEO of Goldman Sachs after the another in your job. How do we know the next Secretary of the Treasury won't be the former CEO of Goldman Sachs, as they have been in the past? They seem to be interwoven. And that's what the American public sees. They see this interconnectedness in terms of their power, their influence, and always to their benefit. So as we see American workers' dreams of retirement being delayed and postponed, and vanquished, and we see them losing their homes, as we see them losing their small businesses, we see record profits over at Goldman Sachs. And so I think we have a responsibility here to say, if indeed in the future, after we have used all of our power, all of our intelligence, every power that we have, to make sure that doesn't happen, that they be the ones paying for this. So my proposal is very simple: No more TARP. No more bailouts. Let them create the fund, the systemic risk fund that will guarantee that the American taxpayer will no longer have to be involved, should they cause such a crisis ever again. You said to us here this morning--I think we're headed in the right direction--you said to us here this morning that you would like there to be a resolution of a systemically risky financial institution, much in the same way that the FDIC deals with banks. Good. We have an FDIC insurance corporation. They pay into the fund. Let's create the fund, just like the FDIC, so that when you need to resolve it, it stands. Your argument is, ``Oh, but Luis, moral hazard. If the fund exists, they'll ask risky.'' I don't see banks racing to the precipice of destruction and bankruptcy because the FDIC exists. Nor do I go to an insurance company and take out a life insurance policy on myself and the next day decide, ``Wow, maybe I'll just start smoking. Maybe I'll start drinking. Maybe I'll start driving my car in a crazy manner. Maybe I really don't care whether or not I live or die. I have life insurance. What the hell if I die? Everything's taken care of.'' No, that's not the way it works. And if that is the way it works, then you should use your new power to say, ``You will not drive, you will not smoke, you will not exist, because we will not allow that kind of behavior to incur a debt to the insurance fund.'' So I think you can use your new power to make sure that they don't behave recklessly any more. And at the same time, should they escape you--because that's why we take insurance-- should they escape you and there is an accident, that the American taxpayer is not once again asked to repay. So can we work to create the fund, like the FDIC fund, and make sure that those who engage in riskier behavior are the ones who pay more into the fund, and the greater your likelihood of creating a debt to the fund that you pay into the fund? Can we talk about that?"
"Secretary Geithner","I think we generally agree. But this is a very important issue. And the difference between doing a fund in advance versus assessing a fee on banks to cover any losses in the event is a very important thing. And this is not quite like an insurance. Deposit insurance is explicit insurance. Explicit contract for insurance. In that case, it makes a lot of sense to establish a pre-existing fund to help give depositors confidence there will be money there to protect their deposits. We don't want to provide explicit insurance for creditors. If you create a fund in advance, there is a risk you're going to create more moral hazard. People will live the expectation, where the government will come in and protect them. We don't want to create that expectation. That's why we think it's better to do it after the fact."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas?"
"Dr. Paul","Mr. Secretary, more and more people today are looking critically at the Federal Reserve and wondering what's going on and of course, the people are asking more questions and they want to know exactly what role the Federal Reserve has played in our financial crisis. In the past, the Federal Reserve was held in very high esteem; that they produced prosperity and full employment and stable prices. Today, they are viewed somewhat differently. And many economists are joining in this. Today the Congress is, by the number of 307, who are asking for more transparency of the Federal Reserve. But also, everybody agrees that we have a financial crisis and we're working very hard on regulations. And I think, sometimes, we get misdirected in this because if indeed the source of our problem is coming from the Federal Reserve, then you're depending too much on regulations without looking at the real cause. We're treating symptoms rather than the cause. Just the idea that the Federal Reserve is the lender of last resort, contributes horrendously to moral hazard, especially when we're dealing with the reserve currency of the world. But everybody knows that, no matter what happens, the lender is going to be there to bail them out. But, you had an interview this year and you were asked what you thought were the really, the causes of this crisis, and I was fascinated with your answer. Because, in a way, it seems like you might have agreed a little bit with what I'm saying. Because you listed as number one, you say, one, the monetary policy was too loose, too long, and that created this just huge boom in asset prices, money chasing risk, people trying to get a higher return. That was just overwhelmingly powerful. And I think that really makes my point and unless you deal with that, and the suggestion is, is that what we do is move in with more regulations and hope and pray that'll work. But again, if this is true, that a monetary policy way too loose lasted too long, how can the solution be speeding it up? How can you say, this is the real problem, so we'll double the money supply. Interest rates were too low at 1 percent, let's make them \1/4\ percent. I can't reconcile this. How can you reconcile this on just common sense?"
"Secretary Geithner","Congressman, there is one part of that quote you omitted, which is, I said, monetary policy around the world was too loose, too long. But I think it's very, you're right to say that this crisis was not just about the judgment of individuals to borrow too much or banks to lend too much. It wasn't just about failures in regulation supervision. It was partly because you had a set of policies pursued around the world that created a large credit boom, asset price boom. And I think you're right to emphasis that getting those judgments better in the future is an important part of the solution."
"Dr. Paul","Okay. On the issue that it's worldwide and we don't have the full responsibility, there's a big issue when you are running and managing the reserve currency in the world and other countries are willing to take those dollars and use those as their asset and expand and monetize their own debt, so it's all, we're not locked in a narrow economy, it's a worldwide economy and it's our dollar policy and our spending habits and our debt that really generated this worldwide crisis. That's why it's not a national crisis; it's a worldwide crisis."
"Secretary Geithner","And again, I'm not sure we disagree, but I would say it slightly differently, which is that a bunch of countries around the world made the choice to tie their currencies to ours and effectively adopt our monetary policy and that made monetary policy too loose in their countries. But it also created this wave of investment and savings into U.S. financial assets, which pushed interest rates down here and pushed up asset prices here, but you're right to say, you have to look at the global mix of policies. We have responsibilities to get that right, but we can't do that on our own. And that's important to think about, not just about regulation."
"Dr. Paul","I do think we do have responsibility on our own, if we're managing the world reserve currency, we can deal with that, we can deal with our spending policies, our deficits, the pressure on the Fed to inflate, so I think if we do what's right, it will benefit the entire world."
"Secretary Geithner","I agree with that."
"Dr. Paul","In your testimony, you also talk about a new international accord and that you're working on internationalizing regulations, which literally scares me. I think we have way too many already and they don't solve the problem. But, in those negotiations, since this issue of a new reserve currency is being discussed in the ordinary media you hear reports. Just this morning, I read, U.N. planning a new reserve currency. In these accords, could you tell me, every time this conversation comes up, and what is being talked about, and how you relate to what the Chinese are saying, yes, they would like to see a new reserve currency, they would like to participate--"
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired."
"Dr. Paul","And it seems like that would be some very important information for us."
"Secretary Geithner","I would be happy to come and talk to you about that privately or in another context."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired and I recognize myself for questions next. Secretary Geithner, I have started to review the draft, the discussion draft that has been introduced and just want to clarify for the record one thing, and I think I know the answer to this without you answering it, but I just want to get it in the record. I noticed that in the council that is created, the financial services oversight council, there is not a designation of the consumer protection financial agency representative. I presume that is because no such agency currently exists, but as part of this whole reform process, if we create a consumer protection financial agency, am I correct in assuming that person, the director, would be on this council? Is that your intention?"
"Secretary Geithner","Yes."
"The Chairman","Okay. I thought that was the case. It just doesn't exist yet."
"Secretary Geithner","And you had the right explanation for why it's not explicitly named there."
"The Chairman","All right. Let me kind of pose the question Mr. Gutierrez has posed in a slightly different way because one concern that has been raised by banks is the integrity of the FDIC, the insurance fund itself. I take it that resolution authority, this new resolution authority is different than what currently exists under the FDIC because there's already in place a mechanism for resolving banks that are regulated and insured under the FDIC. It could involve the resolution of a non-bank. Is that correct?"
"Secretary Geithner","Yes. We're creating a system modeled on the existing system for banks and thrifts to make sure they could be used for a major bank holding company."
"The Chairman","But it could be, theoretically, a non-bank entity that's causing systemic risk or acting out of control in some way. That's true, right?"
"Secretary Geithner","Yes, carefully constrained authority with a lot of checks and balances. That's correct."
"The Chairman","So, one concern that has been raised is, what are the implications of that for the integrity of the FDIC fund, the insurance fund itself? Are we sending a message that we may be in someway endangering that because that has become an asset of the public, so, how do we clarify that? Is there a way to create an entity that, for bigger systemically risky entities or non-financial entities that may be systemically risky that makes it absolutely clear that the insurance fund itself is not going to be put at risk in any way?"
"Secretary Geithner","You're making a very important point. And the insurance fund cannot be used for this; it needs to be separate and completely protected."
"The Chairman","Okay, so--"
"Secretary Geithner","The mechanism we're proposing for these large institutions would be completely separate."
"The Chairman","So, how do you do that without creating some kind of separate fund that's separate from the FDIC fund, itself, or do you just say, we're going to take care of this, but there at least needs to be a guarantee in here that you're not using FDIC funds."
"Secretary Geithner","I think that can be done very clearly and explicitly and therefore, create no risk that the fund, the existing fund, could be used for these other purposes. That would be an important to do. I would support that."
"The Chairman","Where would you contemplate getting funds to do that outside the FDIC?"
"Secretary Geithner","Again, the way the FDIC framework works today, the FDIC does have the authority to go out and temporarily use resources that are not in the fund to do its job to manage the failure of banks. But, it has to recoup any losses that might produce by imposing a fee on banks in the future."
"The Chairman","But, we don't want to impose that fee on banks in the future because they weren't responsible in this context, so--"
"Secretary Geithner","But again, we're really talking about what are effectively banks. They're just not small banks and thrifts. And I think the basis principle of fairness is the right one in this context, which is, if in the future, the government's exposed to any losses as it acts to protect the economy from the failure of those institutions, then I think that the taxpayer shouldn't bear the cost of that. And the cost of that should be imposed on the banks that benefitted from the action. And what the bill proposes to do is to make sure that banks below, I believe, $10 billion is the threshold in the statute, would not be exposed to fees to cover any losses from this authority."
"The Chairman","Okay. We need to keep talking about this, but my time has expired and we obviously can't do it right now. Ms. Biggert is recognized."
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Geithner, it seems to me that an ex post assessment proposal that you have been talking about to pay for the failure of a firm, that the government deems ``too-interconnected-to-fail,'' could create perverse incentives. The firm that fails and their creditors don't have to pay the cost of clean up, but the survivors, those other firms, who had no control over the firm's risk taking, do. So, as a result, no individual firm, and none of the creditors, has an incentive to minimize the firm's risk-taking because the gains are internalized and yet, the losses are borne by others. More than that, knowing that the firms that act prudently will end up at a competitive disadvantage to those firms that are taking the risk, and be having to pay for the failure of those firms, undermines the incentives to manage risks."
"Secretary Geithner","If the proposal did that, I would agree with you. But, that's not what it is designed to do. In fact, it's quite the opposite. We want to make it very clear and credible that again, if a firm manages itself to the point where it's at the edge of the abyss, can't survive without the government, then equity holders and creditors would be exposed to losses in that context. And that would happen before the taxpayer was exposed to any loss. And if the taxpayer was exposed to any loss, then you would have to recoup that loss with a fee on the industry. And I think that, again, that's the model we have today for small banks and thrifts and it makes sense because other banks will benefit from the actions taken to protect them from the risks, that the panic spreads to them. So, I think it's fair in that sense."
"Mrs. Biggert","What happens, though, is that the taxpayer is the interim lender, aren't they?"
"Secretary Geithner","But again, this is taking a model that Congress designed for small banks and thrifts, and just adapting it to a system that has outgrown that framework. But that system exists today and I think it's the best way to do it. The alternative way, which is again, to create an ex-ante insurance fund that would create an expectation of explicit insurance, I think would create more moral hazard."
"Mrs. Biggert","Wouldn't bankruptcy be faster? I think that this proposal, you have what, 60, I forget what it is, 60 months or something to settle this while bankruptcy--"
"Secretary Geithner","Bankruptcy just, again, I think Lehman makes this clear and compelling. And it's why Congress designed a bankruptcy-like system, but it's a different kind of system. We call it resolution authority for banks and thrifts because banks are different. And if they lose the capacity to fund, then they can cause enormous damage to the system as whole. So, you need a slightly different regime for banks because banks are different from regular companies."
"Mrs. Biggert","Okay, if just, let's say, an institution the size of Citi or Bank of America failed, how many institutions would have to be assessed to cover the cost of that resolution?"
"Secretary Geithner","Again, the proposal we made is that banks above a certain size would have to pay a fee, because they would benefit indirectly and directly from the actions taken to contain the risk of panic. So, I think it's fair--"
"Mrs. Biggert","They would benefit because there's one less competitor? Is that what you're saying?"
"Secretary Geithner","No, no, no, no. Because in the absence of action to manage the failure in a way that's safer for the system, does convey some broader benefits. So, it's not like, and so again, they should bear some, now, the choices, which we don't think should--"
"Mrs. Biggert","What would be those benefits?"
"Secretary Geithner","Well again, the way financial panics work, is that viable institutions face the risk they lose their funding and therefore, have to collapse. That's what financial panic did to define the second half of the 19th Century, the first quarter of this century, help produce the Great Depression, led the Congress, this government to act in the Great Depression to set up some protections for that. What we didn't do is extend those protections to institutions that are very much like banks. Again, the alternative approach, which we would not support, is to say, the taxpayer would be there in the front of the line absorbing the cost of that failure. That, we think, is not necessary and would be a mistake."
"Mrs. Biggert","All right. Then, do you think that the government control and concentration of power and the increased unchecked powers to control both the consumers and businesses, as outlined in your plans, is the answer? Isn't this really a huge amount of power that's going to the Administration?"
"Secretary Geithner","Again, let's just step back. Right now, the Congress of the United States has given more than four Federal agencies and a whole number of other agencies the power to do consumer protection. They just did not do it well and we're proposing to consolidate that responsibility in one place so that it can be done better. Now, outside of consumer and investor protection, what we're proposing to do is to make sure the government has the same tools to manage risk it now has in small banks and thrifts for institutions that now define our modern financial system and can bring the economy to the edge of collapse. That's a necessary function for governments to do because banks can pose enormous risk. If you don't constrain the risk-taking of banks, we'll be consigned to repeat the crisis we just went through."
"Mrs. Biggert","I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California."
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you. Mr. Secretary, you have submitted about 900 pages of proposed legislation. I strongly agree with well over 90 percent, I commend your work and that of your staff and the chairman and his staff. I hope my colleagues have gotten this ``Dear Colleague'' letter that I have distributed. If anybody doesn't have it, please ask me, I do have a few extra copies. And Mr. Garrett has already put it in the record. Unfortunately, you have in here what I call ``TARP on steroids.'' You have permanent, unlimited bail-out authority. This is the most unprecedented transfer of power to the Executive Branch to make decisions about both spending and taxes in history, all without congressional approval and in a sharp departure from our Constitutional values. And depending upon what some future executive chooses to do, it authorizes the greatest transfer of money from Treasury to Wall Street, ever. The bill allows for the bailout of both solvent and insolvent financial institutions and Mr. Secretary, the last time you were here, I asked you to embrace a $1 trillion limit on this total bail-out power and I'm still waiting for that embrace. Specifically, Section 1109 allows the Executive Branch to loan unlimited amounts to any solvent financial institution. When such a loan is made, the executives keep their jobs, the shareholders retain ownership of the company, and their shareholder and company value is dramatically enhanced. Section 1604 allows for the bailout of troubled financial institutions with unlimited loans and unlimited investments in the equity of the troubled firm. Now, when the troubled institution gets bailed out, the chief beneficiaries are its creditors. This will cause creditors to lend money on favorable terms to the systemically important institutions. Because after all, if the institution fails, the creditor will probably get paid by the government. However, the shareholders of the bailed-out institutions also stand to benefit handsomely. The taxpayer takes the enormous risk, perhaps investing in the entity or lending money to it. And if things go well, the taxpayers get their money back and the shareholders get a previously comatose and now revived giant institution that they reassume ownership of. Now, Sections 1109 and 1604 provide a multi-step process for bailouts. The first step is that we transfer billions, perhaps over a trillion dollars to Wall Street. The second step is that the taxpayers are supposed to get their money back from a new tax imposed on large and medium-sized institutions. The proposed statute directions the Executive Branch to get our money back within 60 months and then specifies, or such longer amount of time as the Executive Branch decides. So, it could be 60 years. I find it difficult to think how we would ever recoup from a single financial industry, particularly one in extremis, the hundreds of billions of dollars which might be necessary to repay the taxpayer from the next bailout. Now, the Executive Branch is empowered, and look at this from a Constitutional perspective, the Executive Branch is empowered to write the new tax law. So, how much money is paid by a medium-sized financial institution in your district, whether it is $100,000 or $100 million, is totally at the whim of the Executive Branch and can go up or down by that factor, depending upon what the Executive Branch wants to do. The law will allow those institutions that are systemically important to borrow at a lower cost. This will help the largest institutions get larger so that they become greater systemic risk. And by becoming a greater systemic risk, such an institution becomes even more bail-out eligible, further lowering its cost of funds. Now, those institutions that are medium-sized are going to have to pay whatever tax the Executive Branch chooses to impose. However, they're not going to be able to get money at lower rates because savvy investors are not going to believe the local regional banks are going to get bailed out. So, the medium-sized institutions will fund the program, which benefits only their large competitors. It's like being forced to pay insurance on your competitor's business while yours goes uninsured. Now, this tax is sometimes referred to as ``polluter pays,'' but it's hardly that. The financial institution that is the polluter, the one that took big risks and became insolvent, pays nothing. Instead the prudent financial institutions have to compete with the high fliers and then pay to bail them out in the bad times. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentlewoman from West Virginia, Ms. Capito."
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Secretary for being here today."
"Secretary Geithner","Excuse me. Mr. Chairman, am I going to have a chance to respond to Congressman--"
"The Chairman","Yes, if there is no objection, we will take a minute to respond."
"Secretary Geithner","I'll just say very briefly because--"
"The Chairman","Let me say to the Secretary, you will probably have many opportunities to respond."
"Secretary Geithner","Can I just say one thing? I actually think, Congressman Sherman, we agree on much more than 90 percent. And what you were describing is something I would oppose. And it is not what we have proposed. And I share, very much, your basic concern that we not create a system that would create those risks. I would be against that. I would not support it. I would not want to have to live under it and administer it. And it's just not the proposal we're describing."
"Mr. Sherman","If the Secretary wants to correct any of my statutory citations, I hope he does for the record. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from West Virginia."
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Quickly, I would like to ask, are you now imposing larger capital requirements on the systemically ``too-big-to- fail'' institutions at this moment?"
"Secretary Geithner","The current rules which are old and outdated and did not work do establish slightly different ones, but they're not conservative enough, they're not tough enough, and they weren't applied broadly enough."
"Mrs. Capito","So, you are or you aren't? Requiring higher capital?"
"Secretary Geithner","They are somewhat different than what would apply to community and regional banks, but they're not different enough, they're not conservative enough, they're not tough enough, they're not designed well enough, they're not applied broadly enough."
"Mrs. Capito","All right. Well then, let me go to GMAC, which announced yesterday the Treasury was looking seriously, I guess by November, to decide whether to do another infusion to them of taxpayer dollars for the third time. And they're under this regime of trying to raise more capital. Is that correct?"
"Secretary Geithner","I'm glad you raised that--"
"Mrs. Capito","How would this bill be different then, in terms of GMAC?"
"Secretary Geithner","This bill has nothing to do with GMAC."
"Mrs. Capito","Okay, but let's put GMAC under this bill. Right now, today."
"Secretary Geithner","It wouldn't fit, so let me explain and clarify this."
"Mrs. Capito","But wait a minute, but I thought--"
"Secretary Geithner","But let me explain and clarify this. It's very important. My predecessor, the Secretary of the Treasury, made the judgment under the authority Congress gave him in the fall of last year, in the middle of the worst financial crisis in 3 generations, to lend money to 2 automobile industries and to 2 auto finance companies, including GMAC. When I came in, we put the major institutions, including GMAC, through a very tough stress test forcing them to disclose what their losses might be, how much capital they would need, in the event of a worse recession. At that time, we disclosed to the market and to the world, including for GMAC, what their likely capital needs would be. And we committed in the event that they would be able to raise capital from the market, that the government would put that capital in. Now, GMAC, at the time, there was no prospect, frankly, they were going to be able to raise that capital from the market. All the other institutions, in contrast, have been able to go out and raise that capital from the market. The only thing we're doing is making sure we follow through on that commitment and in fact, although I don't want to go into any detail here, in fact, we're likely to have to put in less capital than we expected. Now, no government should be in the position of having to do this kind of thing again. And we want to make sure that our role in those institutions is limited, we're not in there a minute longer than necessary, we get the taxpayers' money back as quickly as possible, with interest, and that is what we are doing for the major banks already where you've seen $70 billion in capital come out, more than $12 billion in returns to the taxpayer on those investments, and we're going to work very, very hard to unwind those positions as quickly as possible. But, those initial judgments were not my judgments, although I support them, and we would like to make sure we get out of this as quickly as we can."
"Mrs. Capito","The fact is, this is the third infusion of TARP funds, taxpayer dollars into GMAC. I don't know what category they would fall in and so I would say, I think that the adaptability issue that you talked about on the resolution, I would like to see an enhanced bankruptcy resolution that provides that partition from the government into the court systems. I think we can create an enhanced bankruptcy through our court system that could address these adaptability issues and the GMAC issue and other issues. And even some of your fellow Presidents of the Federal Reserve have spoken in favor of this because, and I'll just take one quote, there's a widespread relief that public funds will soften the blow to private creditors. And I think this is an option we need to look at as we're working this through. My last comment, question, sort of, and clarification would be, the whole secrecy issue here. You even, in questioning the gentleman from Alabama, basically said, once everybody is required to have larger capital requirements, those will be out in the public realm. There really is no secret in Washington, D.C., for long; they are not too easy to keep, so I think we think that there will be, in the public domain, knowledge of these institutions, and there will be, they will be in a separate class from our community bankers, our credit unions and our other financial institutions. And I think that's problematic because I think that does bring about, whether it says it or not, brings about the ``too- big-to-fail'' concept that we have just seen over the last year."
"Secretary Geithner","That's exactly what we're trying to prevent. But if you want the big banks to have different, tougher capital requirements than small banks, you want them to have different standards because they create more risk, then you have to hold them to tougher standards. And if you hold them to tougher standards, they will disclose how much capital they hold and that's a good thing, not a bad thing."
"Mrs. Capito","No, disclosure's great. Transparency--"
"The Chairman","The time has expired. What I want to do is, I think we can get two more questions in. We have several votes. We're then going to have to excuse the Secretary. We'll come back to the panel of regulators. So, we can go to the gentleman from New York, the gentleman from Texas, if we hold right to the 5 minutes on the first vote. The gentleman from New York."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you for the hard work you have been doing on this committee. Thank you, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary, I would like you to consider, for the sake of this question, that we pass this bill. Say if had we passed this bill as currently drafted 5 years ago, and if that had been the case, I would like to know, one, do you think that Lehman bankruptcy would have still occurred, or would it have been averted? Two, if it had occurred, could you please walk us through how it would have played out differently than it actually did, specifically how and why the system as a whole would have been better able to withstand the shock, and what would have been the consequences or the sequence of events from the moment the precarious state of the firm was identified to when the resolution plan for the firm would have been implemented and finally, how long, in your opinion, would the resolution of such firm have taken place and how much would it have cost the taxpayers?"
"Secretary Geithner","Excellent questions, complicated questions and I won't be able to do them justice this quickly, but, let me make a quick attempt. If this set of authority and constraints had been in place ahead of this crisis, then you would have not have had AIG, you would not have had the world's largest investment banks, you would not have had firms like Countrywide and a bunch of other thrifts across the country, take on a level of risk that they could not manage. That would have been preventable. You would not have allowed a bunch of insurance companies to write a whole bunch of commitments in derivatives they did not have capital to support. That would have been enormously effective in limiting the risk, the build-up of pressures, that helped produce this crisis. You would not have let this terrible set of practices in mortgage underwriting, separate and lending in a bunch of other areas, get to the point they did. They would have been arrested more quickly. People would have been held to a level playing field with tougher requirements to constrain risk-taking. Now, firms will still make mistakes, even within a regime designed well like that. But if they do, then what this regime would allow for is us to take a firm, like Lehman, and have that put them out of existence, have the good businesses sold off, have them resolved, in a situation that would have caused less risk of broad panic and not put the position where you had millions of Americans, millions of investors, people who held pension funds, municipalities, counties across the country who invested money in money market funds that had funded Lehman. They would not have been exposed to that scale of losses and you would not have the extent of the panic you saw last fall, which did threaten the viability of a whole range of other institutions. In that case, what happened is, because the authority didn't exist, the government had to come in and do much more dramatic things, that created much greater risk of moral hazard, provided much greater protections to firms that should not have been exposed to those protections. And that's the basic rationale for this framework and that's what it would have provided. But, we will have firms in the future that make mistakes, we just don't want those mistakes to come at the expense of well-managed institutions and at the expense of the taxpayer."
"Mr. Meeks","Let me, and I want to go to the, in the short time that I have, there are two other things that I'm concerned about, of course. One of the major challenges in dealing with systemic risk going forward will also be the international coordinate and what will be necessary to handle systemic risk posed by financial firms with a global footprint. Could you please clarify for me how this plan before us today would manage the systemic risk posed by firms for which we are the home country, i.e., the firms that are headquartered in the United States but have major operations internationally, and for those where we are the host country from financial firms headquartered abroad but have major interests or major operations in the United States."
"Secretary Geithner","Again, a very complicated but excellent question. Two quick responses. These constraints on capital, on funding, on leverage, on risk-taking, they have to be negotiated and applied internationally so there's a level playing field. So, you want to make sure that other major institutions that compete with U.S. institutions but are Swiss or German or are British, are held to the same standards. Now, in the event, again, they manage themselves to the edge of failure, you make sure that in each of these major financial centers, you have the types of authorities that we're proposing to Congress establish in law today. If you have that authority to better manage failure, then you can better manage the unwinding dismantlement of these major globally active firms. Now, we're going to have to, once we have these national authorities in place, we're going to have to do a better job of coordinating than was possible in the Lehman case, for example. But the real problem in the Lehman case was the absence of resolution authority, both here and in the U.K., frankly. So, establishing at the national level first is probably the most important thing to do to achieve the objective that we both share."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, welcome. Chairman Frank and I will continue to debate the effectiveness of the GSE legislation that he brought to the Congress. What the facts are today, we have essentially 80 percent government control of Fannie and Freddie, their conforming loan limits have increased, increasing their exposure. Their market share has increased precipitously. Taxpayers, between the Treasury and the Federal Reserve now have roughly $1 trillion exposure out of a potential of $2 trillion. Does the Administration plan to offer GSE reform legislation before year's end?"
"Secretary Geithner","No."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you. But if not, when?"
"Secretary Geithner","But I am looking forward to that discussion with you because you're absolutely right, that the system we have in place we cannot live with going forward and that's why we have committed--"
"Mr. Hensarling","Is there a timetable for the Administration to propose GSE reform legislation?"
"Secretary Geithner","What we have said is, that we believe early in the year, we're going to outline at least our initial ideas on options for having to do that, so we need to begin that process soon. I agree with you and I look forward to it."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Secretary. I understand, I believe the Administration is endorsing the chairman's bill that we are discussing today. Did I understand that from your testimony?"
"Secretary Geithner","We worked very closely with the chairman on the bill and as I said, we think it needs the critical test of the strong package of reforms."
"Mr. Hensarling","Initially, under this bill then, taxpayers would shoulder the initial burden of ``too-big-to-fail,'' then I believe that we hope that the institution may be resuscitated, they may be able to pay, eventually, if that doesn't happen, competitors may end up having to foot the bill."
"Secretary Geithner","No, I wouldn't say that."
"Mr. Hensarling","This is not your understanding?"
"Secretary Geithner","Resuscitated is the wrong word, exactly the wrong word. As I said in my statement, the chairman said this, too. You don't want the government in that context to act with the objective of saving the institution to allowing it to live for another day. That would be a mistake. What you want to do is to make sure they live with the consequences of their failure and they can be unwound and sold and disassembled."
"Mr. Hensarling","I heard the chairman use the phrase ``death panels'' again in his opening statement, but as I have been able to read the 253 page bill, I do not believe that type of resolution is required. It certainly is permitted. I did not see where it was required. Perhaps I have missed that in the bill. That is the ultimate goal."
"Secretary Geithner","That's our objective, and I think it's a very important objective."
"Mr. Hensarling","I agree. Let me ask you this question, Mr. Secretary. In thinking through this idea that firms that are in the marketplace will be able to either repay money or their competitors will, do you believe, what portion of the $128 billion that AIG has received, do you believe, ultimately, they will be able to pay back?"
"Secretary Geithner","We are in the process now, as required by law, to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the range of actions the government was forced to take in this crisis, both my predecessor and me, and we're going to be putting out that report in mid-December."
"Mr. Hensarling","Do you have a range now of what you expect the taxpayer to recover?"
"Secretary Geithner","I can't give you a range now, but will be able to give it to you soon."
"Mr. Hensarling","Okay. How about with respect to General Motors and the roughly $63 billion?"
"Secretary Geithner","It is in the same case."
"Mr. Hensarling","Same category?"
"Secretary Geithner","So, we're going to provide a set of independent assessments of what the range of potential losses and gains are across those programs."
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Secretary, we have had this discussion before about what was written into the ESSE statute. The bottom line is, that GM and Chrysler, de facto, have been considered financial institutions under the TARP statute, have received extensive government funding or were designated essentially systemic firms. To many of us, that suggests that ultimately the number of perhaps Fortune 50, Fortune 100, companies that ultimate could receive government bail-out assistance, is not, unfortunately, a limited universe. And when I think about this regime where one's competitors pay to essentially clean up your mess, if WalMart were to become insolvent, how smart or how fair is it to impose that cost upon Target and Costco?"
"Secretary Geithner","Right now, Congressman, who bears the cost when firms screw up? What happens now is, is that companies, families, businesses, taxpayers, community banks, bear that cost. We're proposing to change that. For the simple reason, it's not fair. And what is fair, we believe, is that in the end, because banks are special and risky, if they manage themselves to the point where they're imperiling the system, then if the government--"
"Mr. Hensarling","Should Ford bear the cost of compensating the taxpayer for what happened to GM and Chrysler?"
"Secretary Geithner","Look, I think you're making a good point, but you have to look at the alternatives. The alternatives to what we are proposing, which is based on the existing framework for banks and thrifts, we're under the existing framework for banks and thrifts, under the laws of the land established by Congress. What happens is, if the government has to act to close an institution and it's exposed to any loss, it imposes a fee on banks. It's just, it's very simple, it's compelling and it's better than the alternatives."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Alabama has a brief request."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. As a unanimous consent request, I would like to submit for the record a series of questions to Secretary Geithner on various aspects of this highly--"
"The Chairman","Without objection, let me say that same right will be extended to any member who wants to submit questions."
"Mr. Bachus","And to get the answers, if possible, and or implore the Treasury Department to answer some of these questions and make them available for us."
"The Chairman","I would say, implicit in the request for questions would be a request for answers."
"Mr. Bachus","That's right."
"The Chairman","But if there's a need to make it explicit, we will do that."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you."
"The Chairman","We are in recess. "
"The Chairman","The committee will reconvene, and the next panel will take their seats. I don't know whether ``panel'' is a singular or collective verb, but the members of the panel will each take their seats, so each take his or her seat. And we have had all the opening statements, and we have everyone here, I guess. Yes, we have Commissioner Sullivan. This is a panel of the Federal regulators plus a representative of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners. I just would note that throughout this process, we have stayed in close contact with the State bank supervisors and with the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, who are very much a part of this operation. We are going to start the process now. I have to leave for a quick session. It is my plan, let me tell my friend from Kansas, who as the ranking subcommittee chairman here will be presiding, our intention would be to start with him and go down the list. That is, members who already asked questions of Secretary Geithner on our side will not ask again. So he will begin with himself, and go down the list in seniority, so that we do not have that duplication. And with that, I am going to turn this over to the gentleman from Kansas as we begin our opening statements with the Chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION"," "
"Ms. Bair","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, Congressman Moore, and members of the committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today regarding proposed improvements to our financial regulatory system. The proposals being considered by the committee cover an array of critical issues affecting the banking industry and financial markets. There is an urgent need for Congress to address the root causes of the financial crisis, particularly with regard to resolution authority. In the past week, this committee passed a bill to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, a standard-setting consumer watchdog that offers real protection from abusive financial products offered by both banks and non-banks. The committee is also considering other important legislation affecting derivatives and securitization markets. However, today, I will focus on two issues that are of particular importance to the FDIC. First, a critical need exists to create a comprehensive resolution mechanism to impose discipline on large interconnected firms and end ``too-big-to- fail.'' I truly appreciate the efforts of the committee in moving forward with legislation to address this crucial matter. Second, changes need to be made to the existing supervisory system to plug regulatory gaps and effectively identify and address issues that pose risks to the financial system. One of the lessons of the past few years is that regulation alone is not enough to control imprudent risk-taking within our dynamic and complex financial system. So at the top of the must-do list is a need to ban bailouts and impose market discipline. The discussion draft proposes a statutory mechanism to resolve large interconnected institutions in an orderly fashion that is similar to what we have for depository institutions. While our process can be painful for shareholders and creditors, it is necessary and it works. Unfortunately, measures taken by the government during the past year, while necessary to stabilize credit markets, have only reinforced the doctrine that some financial firms are simply ``too-big-to- fail.'' The discussion draft includes important powers to provide system-wide liquidity support in extraordinary circumstances, but we must move decisively to end any prospect for a bailout of failing firms. For this reason, we would suggest changes that take away the power to appoint a conservator for a troubled firm and eliminate provisions that could be interpreted to allow firm-specific support for open institutions. Ending ``too-big-to-fail'' and the moral hazard it brings requires meaningful restraints on all types of government assistance, whatever its source. Any support should be subject at a minimum to the safeguards existing today in the systemic risk procedures. To protect taxpayers, working capital for this new resolution process should be pre-funded through industry assessments. We believe that a pre-funded reserve has significant advantages over an ex-post fund. All large firms, not just the survivors, would pay risk-based assessments into the fund. This approach would also avoid assessing firms in a crisis. The assessment base should encompass only activities outside insured depository institutions to avoid double counting. The crisis has clearly revealed regulatory gaps that can encourage regulatory arbitrage. Therefore, we need a better regulatory framework that proactively identifies and addresses gaps or weaknesses before they threaten the financial system. I believe a strong oversight council should closely monitor the entire system for such problems as excessive leverage, inadequate capital, and overreliance on short-term funding. A strong oversight council should have authority to set minimum standards and require their implementation. That would provide an important check to assure that primary supervisors are fulfilling their responsibilities. To be sure, there is much to be done if we are to prevent another financial crisis. But at a minimum, we need to establish a comprehensive resolution mechanism that will do away with ``too-big-to-fail'' and set up a strong oversight council and supervisory structure to keep close tabs on the entire system. The discussion draft is an important step forward in this process, and I look forward to working with you on these proposals. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Chairman Bair can be found on page 99 of the appendix.] Mr. Moore of Kansas.  Mr. Comptroller? "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JOHN C. DUGAN, COMPTROLLER, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY (OCC)"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Mr. Moore, Mr. Bachus, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to discuss the discussion draft of the Financial Stability and Improvement Act. We support many of its key initiatives but also have significant concerns about certain provisions; and we are continuing to review the draft in detail to provide additional comments to the committee. Let me briefly comment here on four key parts of the draft. First, we believe the Financial Services Oversight Council established by the draft has appropriate roles and responsibilities. The Council would be well-positioned to monitor and address developments that threaten the financial system, identify regulatory gaps in arbitrage opportunities, and make formal recommendations to individual regulators. The Council would also have the responsibility, which is appropriate, for identifying those financial companies and financial activities that require heightened prudential supervision and stricter prudential standards. Second, the discussion draft expands the role of the Federal Reserve in two fundamental ways: as consolidated supervisor and standard-setter for all systemically significant financial firms; and as the standard-setter for financial activities that pose systemic risk. We support extending the Federal Reserve's consolidated supervisor authority beyond bank holding companies to any other type of financial company that the council identifies as posing systemic risk. The lack of such authority over such non-banking companies as AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers was a key contributor to the financial crisis, and is imperative to eliminate this supervisory gap. In terms of setting and implementing standards for these companies, the discussion draft is an improvement over the Administration's bill in terms of the role played by primary supervisors in the process. While the Federal Reserve would have authority to establish such standards for holding companies and their subsidiaries, the primary supervisors of regulated banks, if they disagreed with such standards, they would have the authority not to impose them if they explained in writing why they believed imposing them would be inappropriate. As a practical matter, this will provide banking supervisors with the opportunity to provide meaningful input into the design of the standards. This is appropriate given that in many cases, primary supervisors will have more expertise with respect to the impact of particular standards on the firms they directly supervise than will the Federal Reserve. We are very concerned, however, about the separate authority provided to the Federal Reserve to establish standards for any financial activity that the council deems to present systemic risk. There, the Board's authority is much broader in that the banking supervisor could in essence be compelled to apply the standard to the bank even if it objected in writing. As a practical matter, this would significantly diminish the banking supervisor's ability to provide that meaningful input to the standards. We believe this expansion of authority is too broad. And, more generally, we believe that there should be a meaningful consultation requirement with all primary supervisors before the Federal Reserve adopts any heightened standard for identified financial firms that meaningfully affects institutions regulated by primary supervisors. We also have concerns about Fed authority to act on divestitures or acquisitions affecting the bank and about continuing gaps in supervision of non-bank holding company affiliates. Third, we support the agency consolidation provisions of the discussion draft. These would transfer the bulk of the functions of the Office of Thrift Supervision to the OCC, while providing a framework in which the Federal Thrift Charter is preserved. The mechanics of the proposed transfer appear to be sensible and workable, and fair and equitable to employees of both agencies. There are, however, important technical areas, including assessments, transfer of property and personnel, and clarification of the agency's independence where we will have additional comments. Finally, the discussion draft includes important new measures to address the so-called ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. It would establish a new regime primarily administered by the FDIC to facilitate the orderly resolution of failing systemically important financial firms. As it has with failing banks, the FDIC would have the authority to operate the financial firm, enforce or repudiate its contracts, and pay its claims. It could also provide the firm with emergency assistance in the form of loans, guarantees or asset purchases but only with the concurrence of the Secretary and only after determining such assistance is necessary to preserve financial stability. And in doing so, however, there would be a strong presumption that the FDIC as receiver would remove senior management. Even more important, shareholders, subordinated creditors, and any other provider of regulatory capital to the firm could never be protected. Instead, they would always absorb first losses in the resolution to the same extent as such stakeholders would in an ordinary bankruptcy. This mandatory exposure to first loss by shareholders and creditors is a substantial change from the Administration's original proposal. We believe it is an appropriate and effective way to maintain market discipline and address the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem while protecting systemic stability. Thank you very much. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you very much, Mr. Dugan. Governor Tarullo, please. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DANIEL K. TARULLO, GOVERNOR, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. We have three panels, lots of witnesses today, so let me be brief. Systemic crises typically reveal failures across the financial system, and that has certainly been the case with the crisis that has beset our country in the last few years. There were profound failures of risk management in many private institutions. There were supervisory shortcomings at each of our financial regulatory agencies. Supervisory changes need to be and are being made. But we also need changes in legislative authority and instructions under which the regulatory agencies operate. In this regard, the discussion draft put forward by the chairman today provides a strong framework for achieving a safer, more stable financial system. The draft contains the key elements of an effective legislative response to systemic risk and ``too-big-to-fail'' problems. It reflects the need for multiple tools in containing these problems: stronger regulation; more effective supervision; and improved market discipline. In particular, creation of the kind of resolution mechanism contemplated in the discussion draft will give the country a third alternative to the current, often unwelcome, options of either a bailout or disorderly bankruptcy. As a complement to the regulatory and other changes in the legislation, it will give the government a means for letting even a very large institution fail while still safeguarding the financial system. This mechanism will move us away from a situation in which severe financial distress for large financial firms has led to a risk of loss being borne by taxpayers in order to safeguard the system to one in which in losses are borne by shareholders, creditors, managers and, if necessary, other large financial institutions. As always, Mr. Chairman, we would be pleased to work with the committee on any issues that arise as you move this legislation forward. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Governor Tarullo can be found on page 291 of the appendix.] Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Mr. Bowman, you are recognized for 5 minutes, sir. "
"STATEMENT OF JOHN E. BOWMAN, ACTING DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION (OTS)"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Good afternoon, Congressman Moore, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to present the views of the Office of Thrift Supervision on the Financial Stability Improvement Act of 2009. As Acting Director of OTS, I have testified several times about various aspects of financial regulatory reform, including OTS' strong support for maintaining a thrift charter, supervising systemically important financial firms, establishing resolution authority over systemically important financial firms, establishing a strong Financial Services Oversight Council, establishing a Consumer Protection Agency with rule-making authority over all entities offering financial products, and addressing real problems that caused this financial crisis and could cause the next one. I have also testified about OTS' opposition to consolidating bank and thrift regulatory agencies, believing that such an action would not have prevented the current crisis, and that the existence of charter choice was not a cause of the crisis. During this time, I have told OTS employees that based on a review of the Administration's initial proposal, they could take some comfort in assurances that whatever happened, they would be protected, treated fairly, and valued equally with their counterparts at other agencies. After reviewing the draft bill, I can only conclude that this is no longer the case. We know that major changes were made to this portion of the bill recently. Instead of abolishing both OTS and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and establishing a new agency called the National Bank Supervisor, the bill would merge the OTS into the OCC. What we do not know is why these changes were made. If Congress concludes that merging agencies would accomplish an important public policy goal, then we believe Congress should build a Federal bank supervisory framework for the 21st Century by establishing a strong, new agency with a name that is recognizable to consumers and accurately reflects its mission. If this bill were to pass as currently drafted, OTS employees would be unfairly singled out and cast under a shadow. The impact of this approach would be particularly onerous for the one third of all OTS employees who are not examiners and who would not work in the OCC's proposed new Division of Thrift Supervision. Instead of having an equal opportunity to obtain a position in the reconstituted agency based on merit and on-the-job performance, they would be folded into current divisions of the OCC. I believe that if all employees had an equal opportunity to compete for positions, then the resulting agency would be more cohesive and would benefit from the most qualified and capable workforce and leadership. It is also critical that the bill include strong protections for all employees of the reconstituted agency, most importantly the same 5-year protection from a reduction in force that is contained in the bill to establish the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. I am concerned that OTS employees could regard the current bill as punitive, and that such an approach would send the wrong signal, not only to the OTS workforce but to all Federal employees about how they would be treated in a similar situation. The timing of such a signal could hardly be worse when a large percentage of Federal employees are nearing retirement age and Federal agencies are redoubling their efforts to attract the workforce of the future to respond to the call of Federal service. In conclusion, Congressman Moore and members of the committee, I strongly urge you to affirm that Congress values the service of all Federal employees and to ensure that this bill would promote a fair, even-handed approach that would result in a harmonious agency with employees hopeful about the future of their agency and their role in it. Thank you, and I would be happy to respond to questions. [The prepared statement of Acting Director Bowman can be found on page 127 of the appendix. ] Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Bowman. The Chair next recognizes Commissioner Sullivan for 5 minutes. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE THOMAS R. SULLIVAN, INSURANCE COMMISSIONER OF THE STATE OF CONNECTICUT, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS (NAIC)"," "
"Mr. Sullivan","Thank you, Mr. Moore, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing. My name is Thomas Sullivan. I am the insurance commissioner for the State of Connecticut. I am also a member of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, serving as Chair of its Life Insurance and Annuities Committee. Today, I represent the views of my fellow regulators on behalf of the"
"NAIC."," With respect to the proposals being considered by Congress to prevent or manage systemic risk, we continue to stress the following principles. First, we believe that any new system must incorporate, but not displace, the State-based system of insurance regulation. State insurance regulators are on the front lines in resolving approximately 3 million consumer inquiries and complaints each year. And that daily attention to the needs of individuals and businesses must remain a cornerstone to any effort of reform. Our national solvency system is resilient and any group capital standards should supplement, but not supplant, the requirements of the functional regulators. Second, Federal legislation should ensure effective coordination, collaboration, and communication among all relevant State and Federal financial regulators in the U.S. financial stability regulation as it relates to insurance can only be stronger with the added expertise of the 13,000 people who currently work in our Nation's State and territorial insurance departments. As such, State insurance regulators must have a meaningful seat at the table of the proposed Financial Services Oversight Council. In order to provide a complete view of the financial system, regulators at the State and Federal level must also have appropriate authority to share information. Third, group supervision of complex holding companies that includes functional regulators is necessary, but preemption of State regulators, if ever necessary, should result only after State efforts have been exhausted. There is a great benefit to having multiple sets of eyes looking at an institution such as what exists today with the current State-based insurance regulatory system. Preemption and putting a single regulator in charge would take away a crucial fail-safe of allowing real and potential oversights by one regulator to be spotted and corrected by another. Additionally, we would also stress that systemic supervision should consider the unique expectations of consumers and that different regulatory structures for different entities within a holding company. The health of a well-regulated subsidiary must not be sacrificed to preserve another unregulated subsidiary. To reiterate, systemic resolution authority must continue to allow State regulators to protect the assets of sound insurance entities from the plundering by unsound, poorly regulated subsidiaries or the broader holding company. State receivership authority prioritizes policyholders as creditors of failed insurers, and we have extensive experience in unwinding insurers. In conclusion, we urge caution in pursuing any proposal that could impact our ability to adequately regulate the insurance market and protect insurance consumers. And we ask that our perspective be considered by this committee in the critical days and weeks ahead. Thank you for the opportunity to testify at today's hearing, and I would be happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Commissioner Sullivan can be found on page 219 of the appendix.] Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Commissioner Sullivan. The Chair first recognizes himself for 5 minutes of questions. Chairman Bair, I believe we must end ``too-big-to-fail.'' I appreciate the work Chairman Frank and the Treasury Department put into improving the systemic risk and resolution authority title. Taxpayers must be fully protected and creditors, shareholders, and management must be fully accountable before taxpayers step in, in my opinion. The discussion draft takes us in that direction, but the Systemic Risk Council and resolution process must be more accountable, efficient, and transparent. Page 17 of the discussion draft states, ``The Federal Government will not publicly release a list of firms that pose systemic risk.'' I understand the intent for a private list is to eliminate any competitive advantage for being an identified firm but does not the marketplace already know who most of these firms are? And the firms that will be put at a competitive disadvantage will be the ones near the borderline, not the obvious ones, like Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, and Bank of America. Additionally, if the point of putting creditors and shareholders on notice is that they stand to be wiped out if a firm posing systemic risk fails, how will they know the value of their investments legal claims if the list of firms is not public? If the cost and burdens put on these firms are not great enough to offset any perceived advantage, I would prefer to increase those costs instead of trying to hide the list. Why not make the list public? Chairman Bair, do you have any thoughts on that? Or at least require identified firms to notify their shareholders?"
"Ms. Bair","I think that it is probably unrealistic to think that a list like that is going to be kept secret. Everyone will already know the obvious firms. I understand the intent of that provision is to try to not make it look like these institutions are ``too-big-to-fail,'' but I think you take care of that problem with a robust resolution mechanism. So, at the end of the day, I am not really sure it is realistic to try to keep those confidential. In any event, they may very well be required to be disclosed as material under the SEC rules. And we have always asked for institutions to fully comply with securities disclosures. So, my sense is it is perhaps not realistic to require that the list be confidential. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Would anybody else like to address that question? Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Dugan","There is a fundamental conundrum between wanting to be able to impose higher requirements on companies that pose systemic risk and trying to keep that quiet or secret somehow. I think at some level, when you impose the requirement, you have to know who they are. And when you do this, if they are significant, people will understand who they are. So I think it is going to be hard not to disclose in some way, shape or form who they are. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Governor Tarullo, do you have a statement, sir?"
"Mr. Tarullo","I think, Mr. Chairman, that Comptroller Dugan has summed it up. Surely we can keep the list private if that is what the Congress wants us to do, but through some combination of self-mandatory disclosures to shareholders and, frankly, just financial analyst observation of their behavior, capital, set-asides and the like for the firms, it is likely that most, if not all, of the institutions so identified would eventually be known to the public. And I think, as someone suggested, you may have a bit of a problem if an incorrect inference is drawn. So while again, there is a reason to try to avoid an increase in moral hazard, we should probably be realistic here about what will and will not be known. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Mr. Bowman and Mr. Sullivan, any comments?"
"Mr. Bowman","I do not think I have anything to add to that, Congressman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. All right. Okay. Next question very quickly. Another issue I would like to discuss is the requirement for firms with assets over $10 billion to contribute to the systemic risk fund after a large firm fails and goes through the resolution process. Why not make only the firms that have been identified to pose a systemic risk pay for the clean-up? Would not this further incentivize firms to not become ``too-big-to-fail?'' Additionally, instead of simply paying back the principal for the use of taxpayer funds to help wind down a failing firm, I would suggest adding that any interest paid to service the national debt and the use of these expenses should also be repaid. What are your views on this? Chairman Bair, do you have any thoughts on that?"
"Ms. Bair","First and foremost, it is very important to make clear that the assessment base would only apply to activities outside of an insured depository institution. Given such an assessment base, smaller institutions would really not pay significantly because most of their assets and liabilities are inside the insured bank. It is hard to know in advance which institutions might pose systemic risk. So the rationale behind the $10 billion threshold was to try to identify those we could say with confidence would not be systemic. However, clearly it is likely that they would be significantly higher in assets if they were systemically significant. If you design the assessment base appropriately, the smaller regional institutions would not pay significantly. But I think there needs to be some cut-off. It is just very difficult to know completely in advance who would or who would not need to be put into this type of resolution authority. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Chairman Bair. And my time has expired. If any of the other members of the panel have thoughts they would like to express, please put those in writing to us if you would. The Chair next recognizes, for 5 minutes, Mr. Garrett."
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the Chair, and I thank members of the panel. First of all, I assume everyone here was listening to the last panel when the Secretary was here? Okay. Oh, you heard it before. You have heard him testify before on two occasions. I do not mean for this comment to be flippant, but he did say it twice when he said that when we do hear the regulators, I know some are regulators, some are not, that--he did not say this, I am paraphrasing, we should take it all with a grain of salt because they are all just protecting their turf. If that is the case, then I guess I should take everything he says with a grain of salt as well because he is probably just protecting his turf, so I do not know why we have any of these panels. But I do really appreciate the testimony that we have heard so far. One of the questions is, and I am going to go up and down the row. Ms. Bair, do you think that we should be extending this overall program beyond depository institutions, first of all?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes, I do think there is a need for this ability. We think the Systemic Risk Council should be able to decide if there are institutions that pose systemic risk that have not already been identified."
"Mr. Garrett","Yes. Now if you were listening to Secretary Geithner, he said something to Ms. Capito, which I do not understand, about the auto companies. First of all, he said he was not around back then, but he agreed with what they did. I would have asked him would he have done it again. Since he agreed with them, I assume he would have done it again. He also said that GMAC would not come under this legislation. Does anybody here understand why GMAC would not come under this legislation? No? So you all assume that it would?"
"Ms. Bair","We would hope that this only applies to financial intermediaries, number one. And, number two, I do not comment on open operating institutions, so I would rather not opine on the second part of the question. I think it would be a determination for the council as to whether a non-bank entity would go under this legislation."
"Mr. Garrett","Here is the thing. When I read this--and I read the beginning and went three quarters, and then I went to the last page to see how it all ended. But if you are reading the definitions to find out who all the council is dealing with, it has a two part standard to define them. One, they must be a corporation registered here in the country, yada, yada, yada. Two, they must be an institution that engages directly or indirectly in financial activity. That would be my dry cleaners who has to take a loan out in order to operate his business. That would be the Drudge Report, which has reported in a local paper as having an influence on the value of the dollar. That would be just about any corporation in this country. That may even be me if I am a candidate who has a corporation for my candidacy because we engage in financial activity. So just reading what they gave us, it is pretty broad as to who comes under the council's authority. Does anybody have a reason to believe that it is not that broad by the language in here, not just by intent?"
"Ms. Bair","Congressman, I was out of town yesterday, and I have been speed reading this myself. That did catch my attention, and we think it could be a little bit more narrow. We would be happy to work with the committee on that technical matter. It is a very broad definition. I would agree with you."
"Mr. Garrett","Anybody else? And that is a neat little comment. Who else had to be like I did speed reading this thing? I think that is a fair assumption, and I appreciate the candor. I did too. I am not a speed reader. It takes me a long time to read this stuff."
"Ms. Bair","We appreciate that the committee did consult with us on a lot of the pieces on resolution authority. I do not mean that as a criticism. I am just apologizing that I have not had a chance to read it all."
"Mr. Garrett","Yes, we all did and this is pretty darn complicated stuff. And that is why I wonder if the next portion, let's take the worst-case scenario that you actually, and I will get back to Ms. Bair on the other question, and the rest of you too can chime in as to whether it should be ex-anti or ex-post as far as the assessment, but it is ex-post in here. I read it to say that what happens is if something goes down, you need to collect money from other companies, institutions, financial institutions over $10 billion, right, again reading this, I could say that does not just apply to financial institutions as I would think of them, as banks and what have you, it could apply across-the-board. It could apply to all the car companies. It could apply to all the biotech companies. It could apply to everyone in this-- just about any corporation that is over $10 billion in size, that they would be responsible for, heaven forbid, that BOA has a problem. Did anybody else read it that this cannot go across- the-board as far where they get it from a $10 billion assessment?"
"Ms. Bair","I do not think that is the intent of the discussion draft. Again, the language can be further refined. But I do not think that is anyone's intent, not as it has been explained to me."
"Mr. Garrett","Okay. I am just going by the language. Intent is one thing but the way that regulators effectively carry things out is not always as Congress intends. The other question is, and I don't know if I have the time, the sell-off ability. Once you have an institution that you define, you might want to sell off its assets, it goes back to what Mr. Kanjorski was raising before, I do not see any due process elements in here. On page 19, mitigation of systemic risk section, if the Board determines, they can sell off assets at will. Is there any due process in the language of the bill? Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. And the witnesses will have an opportunity to present any responses they have in writing for the record."
"Mr. Garrett","Can I get a yes or no real quick? Mr. Moore of Kansas. If somebody has a quick yes or no?"
"Ms. Bair","There is due process in the FDIC's procedures against which this has been patterned, and we can give you a more thorough answer in writing on that, yes."
"Mr. Garrett","Thanks. Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. The Chair next recognizes the gentlelady from New York, Ms. McCarthy. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is interesting listening to the testimony, and I guess when we received this some time late last night, obviously why it is in this small print, I have no idea. At my age, I need it a little bit bigger. Forget about even speed reading. But with that being said, the whole idea about having these hearings and having the different witnesses come in front of us is so that we can go through this, can work through it and certainly make the adjustments that need to be done. We have done that with every piece of legislation as we have gone through this whole process in the last several months. But I guess, Chairwoman Bair, one of the questions that we constantly hear, with the amount of authority that you are going to be having, and it is certainly extensive between the resolution authority and the supervising State charter thrifts, how do you respond to those critics that are saying that this is going to be too much, too far of a reach for you and your group to be able to do everything that they are supposed to do?"
"Ms. Bair","I do not think the State-chartered thrifts will be a significant burden--there are 472 of them. They are primarily smaller institutions. We regulate nearly 5,200 institutions already. So I do not think that would be a significant resource demand. On the resolution authority, obviously this is cyclical work. Somebody needs to do it. We are the best equipped of the agencies to do it. We set up a group to look at what the resource needs would be. We do not think resources would be significant on a start-up basis. We have a lot of contractors that we rely upon. That is the whole idea of the FDIC, to be able to expand quickly because of the cyclical nature of this work. Some agency has to do it, and we certainly have the infrastructure already that can be built out to assume more of this responsibility. My hope is that this is not something that is going to have to be used a lot, if ever. The whole idea of having a robust resolution mechanism is to put better market discipline back into the system, especially to tame some of these larger institutions so that investors and creditors will be more demanding. We want them to understand what kind of risk the institutions are taking, whether they are well-managed, and whether they are transparent because investors and creditors know their money will be at risk if the institution gets into trouble. The hope and expectation is that the new Systemic Risk Council combined with these resolution authorities will help take a lot of risk out of the system. But you will always have cycles, and you will always have instances where institutions get into trouble. So, some mechanism is needed. But, I think that the primary benefit of that is the strong signal it sends to the market that these are the rules. You will take losses if you fund or invest in high risk-taking institutions that get too big. If these institutions are going to be closed, you will take losses. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. I agree with you on that. I would like to throw it out to the rest of the panel. Being that obviously your staff has probably gone through each section that would affect each and every one of you as far as your interests, have you seen anything that you would want to add to the legislation as we go forward to either improve it or do you think--I have heard some complaints there that some parts, that you do not agree to, but what we are missing in this piece of legislation?"
"Mr. Dugan","Mrs. McCarthy, as I indicated in my longer written statement, we have thought for some time that there is an unevenness that goes on right now inside of bank holding companies in the sense that banks are extensively regulated but holding company affiliates, even if they are engaged in the very same activity, are not subject to this same examination and supervision on a regular basis. We think we ought to level that playing field so that you do not have any potential for arbitrage between different parts of the holding company because we did see some of that in previous times. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Governor?"
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you. I think all of us would agree that there will be places where we can make suggestions and recommendations. A couple that come to my mind, first, I do not think we want, the Federal Reserve I do not think wants to be on the board of the FDIC. I do not think we bring a whole lot to that enterprise. So that would be one change. I suspect that we will, working with many of you, see opportunities for perfecting a lot of the other areas as well. And we are not unsympathetic to what Mr. Dugan said at the outset about needing to make sure that the allocation of authorities among agencies preserves the strongly and effectively collegial relationship that we do have certainly in working with the OCC within the bank holding company context."
"Mr. Bowman","In my opening statement, I made a couple of remarks regarding the proposed merger and some of the issues that are there. And we will be happy to provide written suggestions in that regard. Another area we would like to look at is a loss of a fairly fundamental advantage for smaller institutions that have holding companies. That is the consolidated holding company approach where you have the same regulator for the holding company and the institution, as distinguished from larger institutions or entities that have multiple affiliates, perhaps as Comptroller Dugan talks about, where you need a different kind of regulator. In a case of a single institution, perhaps smaller, with a holding company and not a lot of other activities, consolidated supervision of those two entities, the holding company and institution, are real advantages to the smaller community institutions. Mr. Moore of Kansas. I am sorry, the gentlelady's time has expired. And I would ask if Commissioner Sullivan, if you have additional comments, we would like to have those in writing for the record, please. And I apologize. But Mr. Manzullo, you are recognized, the gentleman from Illinois, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you. I have a couple of questions. Mr. Dugan, on page 5 of your testimony you state, dealing with Federal Reserve separate authority and impose heightened prudential standards and safeguards concerning certain financial activities and practices, and then you say, ``Once the Council makes this identification, the Federal Reserve would have unilateral authority to establish a broad range of standards and safeguards for such activities and practices but without seeking public comment and without consulting with primary supervisors even where the primary supervisor has greater expertise and experience with respect to such activities.'' It is obvious you do not like that authority?"
"Mr. Dugan","I think it could be adjusted, and I take the comments of Governor Tarullo to heart. I think there are some places where there needs to be more of a recognition of the respective roles that we have on different things. For example--"
"Mr. Manzullo","I have a question that goes along with that."
"Mr. Dugan","Okay."
"Mr. Manzullo","And I did not mean to cut you off, but you made your point quite clear here, and I respect that. Have you been following all the debate on the Consumer Financial Protection Act?"
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, I have."
"Mr. Manzullo","You realize that what this new piece of legislation attempts to do is exactly what the CFPA would do on safeguarding activities and practices? Maybe you do not realize that but it--"
"Mr. Dugan","It is a different slice, it is more on the safety and soundness prudential side of things, and it is trying to get at a broader range of institutions where the CFPA is focused on consumer protection."
"Mr. Manzullo","Ostensibly, but if you read the CFPA Act, it is so broad. I can see a huge fight going on over who is going to do something, and then this bill says the Fed can move unilaterally without talking to the people who have authority on it. The second question, Mr. Sullivan, I do not want you to fall asleep over there, no one has asked you any questions. Your testimony I think is very, very pointed. On page 5, you identify the blame that many in this town refuse to recognize. When you start at--on page 5, line 3, ``The insurance industry in general does not pose a systemic risk to the nation's financial markets to the extent we have seen in the bank and securities sectors. Rather, insurance companies are more often the recipients or conduits of risk. Mortgage and title insurance, for example, do not generate systemic risk. They simply facilitate underlying loan transactions.'' Is not the problem with the financial collapse that we have had in this country due to the fact that these subprime mortgages were allowed to take place with very little underwriting standard supervision?"
"Mr. Sullivan","And I would point to the area that we regulate, the dominion that we have authority over, insurance has very high capital standards. And as a consequence, we have not seen failures within the insurance industry. I can count on one hand over the last 3 years the insurance affiliates that have failed during the most significant upheavals in the financial market while we have seen hundreds of banks fail during the same time."
"Mr. Manzullo","Then some witnesses here want to pool the entire insurance industry."
"Mr. Sullivan","And we are very skeptical about any grab of such authority when we have a proven system that works."
"Mr. Manzullo","That is my question--the only people around here who do not seem to be getting any recognition or any respect are the people who have been doing their jobs back home in the State insurance authorities, and then all of a sudden people say, let's bring it together. The third question is open to everybody, actually to the Governor. The Feds already had the authority, it has had it for years, to set underwriting standards for mortgages. I am talking subprimes. And do ridiculous things, such as requiring written proof of a person's earnings. And yet the Fed never put those regulations into effect until October 1st of this year. So why should the Fed be given more authority under a brand new organization set up when it had that authority in the first place and simply failed to act? And the failure did not occur during Mr. Bernanke's term. By the time he got in, it was too late."
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Congressman, before I was on the Board, I was actually quite critical in my former capacity as an academic of the failure of the Board, indeed of the government more generally, to move to do something about subprime lending problems, both directly in their consumer implications, and indirectly in their safety and soundness implications. And, as you indicate, I think Chairman Bernanke came, when he became chairman, he took a look at those prudential and consumer regulatory issues and under his leadership, the Board, I think, has enacted a good set of mortgage related as well as credit card related regulations. So the short answer I guess to your question is that the Congress can give mandates to agencies and then give authority to agencies, but the decisions that the people leading those agencies make and the context in which they make them matter. And to that degree, I think we all just have to recognize that the policy orientations of appointees to these agencies are important things for you and your colleagues on the other side of the Hill to consider."
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Manzullo. And next, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you and the ranking member for hosting the hearing. Mr. Bowman, I respect you for speaking up for and standing up for your employees. How many are we talking about? And I am going to ask that you answer as quickly as possible because I have a series of questions that are of concern. How many employees are we talking about?"
"Mr. Bowman","I believe as of tomorrow, it will be 1,040, approximately."
"Mr. Green","And is it your opinion that under the current proposal, these employees will not receive a fair and equitable transition?"
"Mr. Bowman","Our brief review of the legislation we received the other evening would suggest that two-thirds of the employees, the examination workforce, who are specialized and trained, would probably make out quite well. For those who provide other services, there is a difficulty in terms of how they will be merged with the OCC."
"Mr. Green","For additional edification, when you say ``others,'' are we talking about clerks, are we talking about-- tell me what the others consist of?"
"Mr. Bowman","We are talking about economists. We are talking about legal. We are talking about IT specialists. We are talking about compliance specialists who are not examiners, those who would not go to the CFPA."
"Mr. Green","And have you examined any information or any document that would help someone such as myself, who is concerned, something that you have codified that might help me to help those employees, is there something available?"
"Mr. Bowman","There are two places to start, and we will get you the information if you would like. One is the merger of the old Federal Housing Finance Board and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight where they took two agencies and merged them into one, even though they had different charters and different purposes. We would suggest that the second starting point would be the Administration's original proposal. It started off by creating a new agency, and then having the OCC and the OTS come together on equal footing."
"Mr. Green","I will be candid with you, that may be difficult at this point, but I would like to hear more about what you propose. And I will look to work with you and your office and to see what we can do."
"Mr. Bowman","Thank you, and I look forward to that."
"Mr. Green","Thank you. And I will come to you, Mr. Dugan. Let me ask one quick question because I have to make sure that I get this in, a comment first. ``Too-big-to-fail,'' without question, is the right size to regulate. It is also the right size to eliminate. I am of the opinion that we absolutely want to prevent ever having ``too-big-to-fail.'' And the question becomes, can we allow institutions to grow so large that they can be resolved and not cost the taxpayers dollars. The paradigm that we are proposing provides for resolution. The question that the taxpayers are interested in is this. If we had in place what we are proposing, would we be able to wind down AIG and not use one penny of taxpayer money? Ms. Bair? And if you can, give me a yes or a no. I know everyone is tempted to give a long explanation."
"Ms. Bair","Yes."
"Mr. Green","Your opinion is, yes, we could with the current proposal, all right. Mr. Dugan?"
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, I think we could too, but it is hard to go backwards in time and see exactly. I think if you put all these proposals in place, the answer is yes."
"Mr. Green","All right. Sir?"
"Mr. Tarullo","I think that is correct, Congressman. I do not think it would have cost the taxpayers a penny in the end."
"Mr. Green","In the end, not a penny, current proposal in place?"
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes, the question would be would there have been any temporary liquidity support provided in the interim, but that could have been fully collateralized and repaid."
"Mr. Dugan","I would say yes, but of course, the devil is in the details."
"Mr. Sullivan","And the only concern we have from a State regulator's perspective is protecting policyholders. So if the wall of the assets that protect policyholder liabilities, and so if the unwinding--"
"Mr. Green","I am going to take that as a yes."
"Mr. Sullivan","As long as we protect policyholders, that is our--"
"Mr. Green","I have to move on. Final comment and then Mr. Dugan is this. Once that list is codified, my assumption is that it will become public knowledge. Once more than one person knows about it, in the world that we live in today, things just do not remain esoteric. And I think we should provide for the possibility that it will be public more than private. Now, Mr. Dugan, your comment?"
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, very quickly, Mr. Green. I just wanted to say that on the transfer of personnel and fairness issues, we absolutely want to work with you to make sure that we provide information to you as well as OTS to make sure that it is fair and orderly."
"Mr. Green","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. If any other witnesses care to respond to Mr. Green's question, you are welcome to do that for the record. The Chair next recognizes Mr. Paulsen for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Paulsen","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just follow up. We had some discussion earlier this morning about the repayment from the AIG loan and the GM bridge loan to nowhere as being far from certain that those payments are going to be repaid. And I think many of us here have had concerns that this Administration may be using the extension of TARP, for instance, as a continued ATM or walking around money and having those funds out there. And Mr. Volcker recently testified before the committee here. He said that, ``The proposed overhaul of financial rules would actually preserve the policy of `too-big-to-fail' and could lead to future banking bailouts.'' I am just curious, Mr. Geithner has left now, but from your perspective, can you just comment, what in this plan really prevents or assures that we are not going to have those future bailouts occur after we heard that testimony from the former Chair of the Federal Reserve?"
"Ms. Bair","We think there are areas where this proposal could be strengthened, but it prohibits any type of open bank assistance for an individual firm. That is number one. It prohibits capital investments of any kind. It does under extraordinary circumstances allow the government to provide some liquidity support for healthy institutions, but that needs to be done through a systemic risk process, which is a fairly extraordinary procedure. It also says that if there are any losses, a tenet with any of this, that it would be borne by the industry through an industry assessment. There would be no more one-off bailouts under this. There would be a fund. Whether we think it should be pre-funded or funded after the fact, any cost or unexpected losses associated with the resolution activity would be borne by the industry. It does not provide for a guarantee of liabilities. Such obligations should not be affirmed for individual firms. This is far different from the type of thing you saw with AIG. There would be no capital investments, for one thing. It would be a closed system. Again, we do not expect significant losses, as this is a wind-down process. It is more akin to a bankruptcy process in terms of the losses being imposed on shareholders and creditors. You would not have bondholders being taken out at par the way you had with some of these bailouts, for instance. And shareholders would be completely wiped out whereas they might live to fight another day with some of the bailouts that had been done so far. So this is a profoundly different process from what you have seen in the past. And that is not a criticism, we did what we had to do. There were no tools available, but this will be very different going forward."
"Mr. Paulsen","And many of us I think would advocate for the bankruptcy process to recede, and we had discussions earlier even this morning about the moral hazard argument. What in the plan really encourages companies to not engage in risky behaviors, to actually grow larger to a size where they will be deemed systemically important or at risk?"
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Congressman, there, the question you just asked brings up the important point that we need to have mutually reinforcing pieces of this system. Chairman Bair has just described how market discipline can be brought to bear when you have a robust resolution mechanism. I would add to that, bringing into the parameter of companies that are regulated, firms like AIG and Bear Stearns, stops you from getting to a situation which is very high leverage in some unregulated firms. In terms of the question of, does this provide an incentive to become big or a disincentive to become big, I think it is incumbent on all of us to make sure that the incentives in the system make--require firms to internalize the costs of their bigness and their interconnectedness. It requires the counterparties of those firms to internalize them when they enter into transactions. It requires the firms themselves because of the imposition of special liquidity and capital requirements to internalize them. So when we put all three pieces together, regulation, supervision, and market discipline, we should make sure that each firm, small, medium or large, is able to provide financial services to the businesses and consumers of our country but only in such a way that their safety and soundness is assured."
"Mr. Paulsen","And before I just run out of time, Mr. Chairman, I want to ask Commissioner Sullivan, who is now on the end as well, do you have any concerns about Treasury, the Treasury Department or the Federal Government essentially obtaining authority to regulate insurance under the draft plan or concerns about Federal interference down the road as a State commissioner?"
"Mr. Sullivan","Indeed, with respect to any preemption what we do today, yes. So if capital requirements are set higher than what we set today in the State regulatory system, have at it. But do not undermine or preempt what we do today, as I stated in my comments, our record is proven and it speaks for itself. We have not had any failures of insurance enterprises and that is because they are strictly regulated from a financial solvency perspective. So do not preempt us from a resolution authority perspective. Do not preempt us from a capital requirement perspective. Do not preempt us in any of those ways because our system works."
"Mr. Paulsen","Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to ask unanimous consent to submit two letters for the record, one from CMSAA and one from the American Land Title Association. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Certainly, they will be received for the record. Thank you, sir. The Chair next recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Miller, for 5 minutes. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Bair, Mr. Garrett asked earlier whether if there was a resolution under these powers, a manufacturer who is just minding their own business might be surprised to get an invoice declaring that they were a financial company, and they had assets of more than $10 billion. And what would keep that from happening. And you said that you did not think that was intended by the legislation. Page 165, 166 includes a definition of financial company, which is a bank holding company as defined in Section 2(a) of the Bank Holding Company Act. An identified financial holding company is defined in Section 2(5) of the Financial Stability Improvement Act, any company predominately engaged in activities that are financial nature, for purposes of Section 4(k) of Bank Holding Company Act or any subsidiaries of any of those. And all of those are defined statutory terms. And with respect to the ``predominately engaged in activities,'' there is a procedure for notice that the company is regarded as predominately financial and they have an opportunity to contest that. Does that support your argument that no manufacturer minding their own business is just going to get an invoice?"
"Ms. Bair","It certainly attempts to. Again, my apologies, as I have not had a chance to read this entire bill. I think we all understand we want this confined to financial intermediaries. If there are further refinements in the language, we are happy to work with the committee. But, yes, I think that is clearly the intent. And, as it is drafted here, that is what is expressed. But, there are other provisions I know my staff had concerns over, and I need a chance to read the entire bill before I can respond. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. All right. Thank you. There has been a substantial discussion about whether banks should not do certain things. Any systemically significant firm should not engage in some inherently risky procedures. We have had that comment from economists for several months now as part of this debate. Mervyn King, the Bank of England governor, said there should be--banks should be broken up into casino functions and utility functions. And Paul Volcker, testifying here last month, said that much the same thing, and specifically gave the example of proprietary trading. Do you agree that there are some functions that systemically significant firms should not do, among other reasons, because it is almost entirely impossible for their board of directors or even their CEO to know what they are doing if they are engaged in all manner of complex activity, do you agree with that? And do you agree specifically with respect to proprietary trading?"
"Ms. Bair","Right. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. And does this bill give sufficient authority to do that?"
"Ms. Bair","I think he was saying that insured depository institutions should not do that. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Right."
"Ms. Bair","Those that benefit from the deposit insurance. I do not think he was saying nobody should do that. I think his preference would be basically to do away with Gramm-Leach- Bliley so that you have banking operations that take deposits and make loans separate from securities and insurance activity. So, we have somewhat of a hybrid approach. We would like much more definitive walls of separation, both legally and functionally, between insured depository institutions and other affiliates in a bank holding company. We also would agree with Comptroller Dugan that regulatory standards for the holding company activity should be higher. The capital standards should be at least as high for holding companies as they are for insured depository institutions. The quality of capital should be just as high. If you are going to have an insured depository institution, you should be in a position of strength, not weakness. We would like some strict separation of proprietary trading and a lot of these complex securitizations, etc., should be outside the insured depository. We also were very grateful that the bill does propose giving us some back-up authority for holding companies so that when a holding company affiliate is doing something that puts the insured institution at risk, we would have some back-up ability to come in there and work with the Federal Reserve, presuming the Federal Reserve is the holding company supervisor, to remediate that situation. We do want greater walls of separation between the banks and other types of activities, but we would not say that they could not co-exist within a broader holding company structure. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. I am sorry. Say the last bit again?"
"Ms. Bair","So we would like greater separation between the insured depository and the affiliates that do other types of higher risk activities, though we would not say that the insured institution has to be taken completely out of the holding company structure. They could co-exist in a holding company structure. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. Mr. Dugan?"
"Mr. Dugan","The one thing that I would add is that there is a notion that you can stop financial companies from engaging in this risky activity, and that will solve the problem, but the problem is somebody will continue to do those activities. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Right."
"Mr. Dugan","They will get systemically significant and big. That is what happened last year. We had companies that weren't banks that did that, and we ended up having to do something about it. So I guess the approach of this bill is you cannot ignore the fact that they can become systemically significant. And that being the case, you ought to have ways to go regulate them. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. And I support that approach. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair will next recognize the distinguished ranking member, Mr. Bachus."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One thing, the State regulators I know under the FFIEC, you all are voting members under that council. This is a council that presently exists, and I think I would agree with my colleagues who say that the States ought to have voting members there. It is kind of letting you serve on something and not giving you a vote or a voice is I do not think it is acceptable. Mr. Green mentioned the OTS and the employees, and it definitely seems like they are receiving shabby treatment, as has Mr. Bowman. And you also have a concern that if the OTS is simply merged into another agency, and Republicans have proposed that as well as Democrats, so I am not casting any aspersions on anyone, but it obviously would have a net effect of diminishing the thrift charter. I know that everyone seems to be proposing that, but I appreciate your testimony. I think you outlined ways it can be done. I know the American Bankers Association wants a strong thrift charter, but I do not know that you can have a strong thrift charter if you do not have an agency whose primary responsibility is to the thrift. And most of those are small, a lot of them are Main Street banks at a time when we are concerned about concentration and ``too-big-to-fail.'' And it seems like that principle works against the purpose of the bill. Mr. Tarullo, the Federal Reserve gains an awful lot of new authority under this draft. What role did the Federal Reserve have in drafting the text?"
"Mr. Tarullo","So far as I am aware, Mr. Bachus, we had no role in drafting the text. We did not do the drafting. We certainly, along the way, over the last 6 months, but more recently over the last few weeks, were asked our views, I think as my colleagues were, by people in the Administration and people on the committee staff and elsewhere. But we were not involved in the drafting of the text itself."
"Mr. Bachus","Were you consulted throughout the process? Were you consulted during the writing of it?"
"Mr. Tarullo","There were certainly some consultations in the sense that we were asked by the Administration our views on certain things, and we had meetings, the President's Working Group and elsewhere, among many of us on that topic. But if you are asking whether there was some sort of particular, our particular role as opposed to that of our colleagues, I think the answer to that is no. We were all certainly talking to one another."
"Mr. Bachus","All right. Now, under this, you would pick up the power to force companies into bankruptcy or require them to divest segments of their company, would you not?"
"Mr. Tarullo","I believe there are provisions in the bill which would do those two things, yes, sir."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay, all right. It also gives you the ability to overrule your colleagues at other Federal banking agencies, are you aware of that?"
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes, and I think that is what Mr. Dugan was alluding to in his opening statement. And, as I said, I think there are a lot of things that went wrong in supervision and regulation over the last 10 years in this country, but one of the things that I found when I came to the Fed earlier this year that actually goes right is the cooperation between the OCC and the Fed and the regulation of holding companies that have national banks. And I do not think we want to undo that. I think we want to have a collegial relationship, not one of trying to set up situations which are overruling one another. So we certainly want to come out with an accommodation that achieves the safety and soundness ends that I think the drafters intended to achieve on the one hand, while preserving that collegial relationship on the other."
"Mr. Bachus","And I think you will agree that some of the policies by the Fed leading up to the events of the last 2 years actually probably contributed to the overextension of credit."
"Mr. Tarullo","So, Congressman, this may be my academic self speaking, but I can identify a lot of policies by a lot of entities who contributed to this, including the Fed."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. I appreciate that. Chairman Bair, Republicans have pretty much uniformly rejected the idea of a continuing permanent bailout mechanism, but I know Chairman Frank in this legislation sets up--funds two different basically bailout authorities. Can you explain or give us some of your concerns with a system that pays for failure after the fact or one that assesses surviving competitors of failing institutions as this plan does?"
"Ms. Bair","We do think there are some areas where it could be strengthened and are happy to keep working with the committee. There is a suggestion of a conservatorship for failing institutions. We think the process should be a receivership with the goal to be a prompt wind-down of the firm or breaking it up and returning it to the private sector. I think it is very positive that it prohibits capital investments of any kind. If there is truly a system-wide problem, such as an international destabilizing event, and there is a system-wide problem where even healthy institutions cannot get liquidity support, I think there should be some ability for the government to step in. But that should be only with the systemic risk procedures. We think that should apply, whether it is us giving the support or the Federal Reserve giving support. The intent is a wind-down authority, not a bail-out authority. That is our understanding of the intent. And we are happy to keep working with the committee to effectuate that. But you are certainly right, the whole purpose of doing this is to send a strong signal to investors and creditors that they will be the ones taking losses and to management that they will be replaced if they get themselves into trouble. It is very important that the bill sends that message."
"Mr. Bachus","And the ability to loan money to a failing corporation. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired."
"Ms. Bair","No, we would not support that. Mr. Moore of Kansas. I would ask the gentleman and the Chairman to have any additional comments in writing please for the record. Next, Mr. Perlmutter from Colorado, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try to keep it under 5 minutes. Many of you have appeared probably a dozen times, if not more than that, in the course of the last year before this committee. I just kind of have to go back to this time last year. And in any of your experiences, had you ever seen a banking system in such peril or the economy in such peril in September, October, November of last year? And I would say let the record reflect people are shaking their heads no."
"Ms. Bair","No."
"Mr. Tarullo","Absolutely not."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Okay. So now after all the times you have appeared, all of you have been thinking about how do we manage the system so that we can deflect the failures that we saw last fall from happening again, at least during our lifetimes. The next generation will do whatever it does. And I know it is almost premature asking you this question, but in your commenting to the Treasury Department or in the time that you have had to kind of skim this bill, are we missing something to try to constrain and be able to respond to the free fall that we had last fall? And, Ms. Bair, it is an open-ended question, if you can kind of give me a quick answer, I would appreciate it."
"Ms. Bair","No, I think the things that we consider to be most important are in this bill. We would like to see a stronger council. I think one of the benefits of the council is the ability to identify and address regulatory gaps, as well as to serve as a check on all of us to make sure we do our job. We believe the council should have the ability to set its own rules, that it would increase standards if individual regulators are not doing what they are supposed to."
"Mr. Perlmutter","And I appreciate your saying that because I did want to respond to Mr. Garrett. I kind of agreed with his point about when Secretary Geithner did not think GMAC Finance would be part of this. And then his next point, but he thought his dry cleaner would be part of it. Just looking at page one, he did not get very far in the bill, because on page one, it defines the financial company as any incorporated, any organization incorporated in the United States, and it talks about banks. And then it says, ``that is in whole or in part engaged in financial activities.'' So that is a lot of companies. Then there is a limitation that I hope would get rid of his dry cleaner, and that is on page 13, where it says that the council determines is a material financial distress that could pose a threat to the financial stability of the economy. Now, I hope his dry cleaner is not so big that it would pose a financial threat to the economy. But it does seem to me, Ms. Bair, that you do have a very broad roof that you can--"
"Ms. Bair","That is right. As I told Congressman Miller earlier, our staff were a little concerned about this in whole or in part, directly or indirectly. But you are right. It would have to be systemic for the council to get involved, so clearly the dry cleaner could not at all be subject to this. A large commercial entity, perhaps. This should be clarified because I think we all are talking about financial intermediaries. But, absolutely a dry cleaner could not be included in this."
"Mr. Perlmutter","So General Electric, major manufacturer, major company but also has a major financing arm. I would expect it would be, in some facet or another, covered by this. And not to pick on them, I am just trying to figure out who is covered and who is not?"
"Ms. Bair","Right, I think we're talking about institutions of significant size and complexity. Yes, that would be my assumption."
"Mr. Perlmutter","That if they were to get into trouble, it could have a domino effect."
"Ms. Bair","That is right."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Just starting with IndyMac, then Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and then Merrill Lynch and AIG and Lehman and all that, it was dominoes."
"Ms. Bair","Right."
"Mr. Perlmutter","And it was a painful experience. So, Mr. Dugan, I will ask you this, kind of changing the subject. There is a question, and there seems to be some debate, I am a bankruptcy lawyer, all right. That was 25 years I did Chapter 11's. And it bothers me a little bit that people are being so free and loose with the word ``bankruptcy'' because there are all sorts of bankruptcies. There are liquidating bankruptcies. There are reorganizing bankruptcies. There are different varieties. And we should not use it as one thing. Do you think that there should be the ability to reorganize or do you think there should be an orderly liquidation of companies that potentially are systemically risky and are in the financial business? For the most part, we do orderly liquidations of it."
"Mr. Dugan","It is a good question, and I am not sure. I am not a bankruptcy lawyer, and I think there is a very important technical bankruptcy point in here about the reorganization question. I think what the draft gets at and what people have been so concerned about is, however you do it, the shareholders of the company and the subordinated creditors bear the losses, so even if it is reorganized, others senior in the chain might get there. It has been viewed as somewhat impractical, I gather, historically, to do this in the financial institution context. I do not really understand why, but I think it is a perfectly legitimate question. And let us give it some more thought, and we will provide something for the record."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Thank you. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. Votes have been called. We are going to have one more set of questions. Ms. Bachmann from Minnesota, please?"
"Mrs. Bachmann","Mr. Chairman, thank you. Again, with the 253-page bill that just came out less than 48 hours ago and another several thousand page bill on the horizon with the healthcare, this is a lot to take in. And I think two adjectives that come to my mind are breathtaking and stunning when I look at the Resolution Authority. And I think on both sides of the aisle I think there is bipartisan concern about the unprecedented level of power that seems to be centralized under this. So it seems to me prudent that we would exercise serious due diligence on the part of establishing what the chairman and the President have called a Resolution Authority to break up systematically risky institutions. And here is my question. The proposal looks to me like we are codifying--and I am sure you have gotten this comment before of what our constituents were outraged about last year when Congress passed TARP, except under this proposal we, the Congress, wouldn't have to take a vote each time an institution needs a bailout; and the bill would give the FDIC the authority to extend credit on the backs of taxpayers whenever it wants. Do you think that is an accurate characterization, or am I wrong? And that is for anyone on the panel."
"Ms. Bair","No. I don't think that is an accurate characterization. I think the bill carefully constrains what we can and can't do. And we clearly cannot provide any kind of assistance, nor can the Federal Reserve, I might add, on an individual basis, to an individual failing firm. There is a process for a systemic support if you had a major destabilizing event where the government needed to step in and stabilize a system, or even healthy institutions could not access liquidity. But no, the whole point of this is to make sure that the shareholders and creditors are the ones that take losses, and there is an orderly wind-down. You may need to have some temporary liquidity support into a bridge financial institution as you break it up and sell it off. But I think those short-term liabilities are already fully secured. So, that would not be imposing any losses on the receivership that wouldn't otherwise be obligated, whether as a bankruptcy practice or the statutory resolution process. Based on our experience with bridge banks, we think that those preserve value and minimize losses if you can maintain the short-term funding relationship. This is not a bailout mechanism. This is a wind-down mechanism. We think it is very important that this be clear and understood."
"Mrs. Bachmann","Let me follow up then. With the Republican alternative that several of my colleagues are offering, it is clear that bankruptcy is the end game for those who make mistakes or the risky banks. And that is what our plan does, to strengthen market discipline by making it clear that a failing institution's creditors and counterparts would bear the cost of the financial mistakes, not the taxpayers. And I know I heard Treasury Secretary Geithner say earlier that he didn't believe that this would fall on the back of the taxpayers. But there was a certain amount of incredulity on the part of us as Members of Congress, especially when we heard the $81 billion that has already been forwarded to the auto makers. We can expect that the taxpayers won't be paid back. And I think that we are very concerned when we look at the wind-down authority and wondering, how is that a speedier resolution of a company than what we would find in bankruptcy?"
"Ms. Bair","The bankruptcy process is what we have had, and it led to all of these bailouts."
"Mrs. Bachmann","But we haven't had, perhaps, a modification of that, that would anticipate--"
"Ms. Bair","We don't differ profoundly in where we want to end up. We believe the claims priority that should apply to the receivership process, which is what we have now for insured banks, is much along the lines of what you have in bankruptcy."
"Mrs. Bachmann","I think that may be accurate, that we may not differ in where we want to end up other than authority. Who has that power? Who has the authority? And I think that is the real concern here, is that taking away a power from the Congress and giving that over to the Executive Branch. And again, I think Mr. Kanjorski asked a very good question earlier of the Treasury Secretary when he said, where in the constitution would you find that authority? Mr. Kanjorski said he didn't believe that Congress even had the authority to devolve to the Executive Branch of the taxpaying function, or the tax-assessing function. And I would agree with Mr. Kanjorski on that. On an unrelated question--this would be for Chairman Bair-- on October 7th, I sent you a letter requesting examination of the role of ACORN, what they play in helping banks satisfying their Community Reinvestment Act obligations. And as you know, ACORN has earned a reputation with the public for extremely poor systemic controls that have led to persistent unethical behavior, and repeated disregard for voter registration and other Federal and State laws. So as chairman of the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council, I requested that you and your fellow council members conduct a thorough examination of the issue and prohibit financial institutions from receiving CRA credit by donating to or partnering with ACORN. Have you seen my letter? Are you willing to consider such an examination?"
"Ms. Bair","I have seen your letter, and we are in the process of consulting with our fellow regulators and giving you a good response."
"Mrs. Bachmann","Do you have any idea when I would anticipate a reply? Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentlelady's time has expired."
"Ms. Bair","We will try to do it as promptly as possible. We will give you a thoughtful response."
"Mrs. Bachmann","Thank you very much. Mr. Moore of Kansas. If the gentlelady has additional questions--"
"Mrs. Bachmann","I thank the chairman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. --or comments from the panel, that is fine. We have Mr. Foster for 2 minutes, and then we are going to go for votes. Votes have been called. Mr. Foster is recognized for 2 minutes, sir."
"Mr. Foster","Thank you. My questions are in regard to subtitle (f) on risk retention during the asset-backed security process. And it is my reading of it that you have very wide authority to set it not just at 10 percent, but to eliminate it entirely or make it significantly higher. My concerns are with the macroeconomic effects and possible politicization of this. It is obvious this could exert a very powerful, and possibly beneficial, damping influence on, for example, real estate price bubbles. If someone had said several years ago that, look, you are securitizing out of Las Vegas, you don't have to put 10 percent down but 25 percent down, it could have had a very beneficial macroeconomic effect. And so my question is, how do you anticipate this will actually be exercised? Do you anticipate varying the risk retention by asset class? By industry sector? By geographical region, in the case of mortgage securitization? Governor Tarullo?"
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Congressman. Obviously, it will depend on how you all write the bill in the end. But I think our preference would be for the capacity to do just what you suggest. That is, the variety of asset classes which can be subject to securitization, the variety of the credit circumstances under which they are so subject, and, importantly, the role of servicers as well as originators of securitized assets, are such as to make the retained risk a very useful instrument, but one that needs to be deployed in a fashion that takes account of the centers that vary across asset class."
"Mr. Foster","So you contemplate using it in concert with monetary policy? For example, to cool off a real estate bubble?"
"Mr. Tarullo","I think that provision, as I read it, is intended to be a safety and soundness rather than macroeconomic provision. And unless instructed otherwise, I think that is the way we would read it, which is to say, how does risk retention ensure that the loans in question, when securitized, are themselves risk appropriate? So I don't think we look at it as a monetary policy instrument as such, although I think your question--"
"Mr. Foster","It certainly would have an effect because even--"
"Mr. Tarullo","It would have an effect, and one would need to think about it. That is correct. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. I want to thank the second panel for your testimony and for your appearance here today before this committee. Votes have been called. After votes, we will resume with the third panel. The committee stands in recess. Thank you all. "
"The Chairman","We will reconvene. I apologize to everyone except Mr. Baker for this delay. He knew what he was getting into. As for the rest of you, we apologize. We thank you for being here. Let's get right to the statements, and we will begin. Mr. Trumka, I know you have some time constraints, so if at any point you have to leave, we understand. Mr. Baker, too."
"Mr. Trumka","Thank you."
"The Chairman","And actually, if you leave, it will be like the old days when we used to have pairing, one on each side. So you can leave together. We will begin with Richard Trumka, President of the AFL-"
"CIO."," "
"STATEMENT OF RICHARD L. TRUMKA, PRESIDENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF LABOR AND CONGRESS OF INDUSTRIAL ORGANIZATIONS (AFL-CIO)"," "
"Mr. Trumka","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you to Ranking Member Bachus. My name is Rich Trumka, and I am the president of the AFL-CIO. The AFL-CIO is a federation of 57 unions representing 11\1/ 2\ million members. Our members were not invited to Wall Street's party, but we have paid for it with devastation to our pension funds, lost jobs, and public bailouts of private sector losses. Our goal is a financial system that is transparent, accountable, and stable, a system that is the servant of the real economy rather than its master. The AFL-CIO is also a coalition member of Americans for Financial Reform, and we join that coalition in complimenting the committee for its work on the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, and we endorse the testimony of AFR's witness here today; however, we are concerned with the working draft, that the committee's work thus far on the fundamental issues of regulating shadow financial markets and institutions will allow in large part the very practices that led to the financial crisis to continue. The loopholes in the derivatives bill and the failure to require any public disclosures by hedge funds and private equity funds fundamentally will leave the shadow markets in the shadows. And we urge the committee to work with the leadership to strengthen these bills before they come to the House Floor. The subject of today's hearing, of course, is systemic risk. And the AFL-CIO strongly supports the concepts in the Treasury Department White Paper, that a systemic risk regulator must have the power to set capital requirements for all systematically significant financial institutions, and be able to place a failing institution in a resolution process run by the FDIC. We are glad to see that the committee bill actually does those things. Although we have some concerns with the discussion draft that was made public earlier this week, we really haven't had a chance to go through it. And our understanding so far is that some of the intention of the committee, we may have read things at variance with that, and we think they can be worked out. But our concern is that this bill gives pretty dramatic new powers to the Federal Reserve without reforming the governance by ending the banks' involvement in selecting the boards of the regional Fed banks, where the Fed's regulatory capacity is located. The discussion draft would appear to give power to the Federal Reserve to preempt a wide range of rules regulating the capital market, power which could be used, unfortunately, to gut investor and consumer protections. If the committee wishes to give more power to the Federal Reserve, we think it should make clear that this power is only to strengthen safety and soundness regulation, and that it must simultaneously reform the Federal Reserve's governance. These powers must be given to a fully public body, and one that is able to benefit from the information and perspective of the routine regulators of the financial system. We believe a new agency with a board made up of a mixture of the heads of the routine regulators and direct presidential appointees would be the best structure. However, if the Federal Reserve were made a fully public body, it would be an acceptable alternative. Unfortunately, it is reported today that the Fed has rejected Treasury Secretary Geithner's request for a study of the Fed's governance and structure. We are also troubled by the provision in the discussion draft that would allow the Federal Government to provide taxpayer funds to failing banks and then bill other non-failing banks for the costs. We realize that it is not intended that this be a rescue, but rather a wind-down. The incentive structure created by this system seems likely to increase systemic risk, from our point of view. We believe it would be more appropriate to require financial institutions to pay into an insurance fund on an ongoing basis. Financial institutions should be subject to progressively higher fee assessments and stricter capital requirements as they get larger, and we think this would actually discourage ``too-big- to-fail.'' Finally, the discussion draft appears to envision a regulatory process that is secretive and optional. In other words, the list of systemically significant institutions is not public, and the Federal Reserve could actually choose to take no steps to strengthen the safety and soundness regulation of those systemically significant institutions. We think that in these respects, the discussion draft appears to take some of the problematic and unpopular aspects of the TARP and make them a model for permanent legislation. In closing, Mr. Chairman, I would say that instead of repeating some of the things we did in the bank bailout, Congress should be looking to create a transparent, fully public, accountable mechanism for regulating systemic risk and for acting to protect our economy in any future crises. On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Trumka can be found on page 308 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Next is Richard Baker, president and chief executive officer of the Managed Funds Association. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE RICHARD H. BAKER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MANAGED FUNDS ASSOCIATION (MFA)"," "
"Mr. Baker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to be here today. I shall wait to the end of the proceedings to come to a resolution thereon. MFA is the primary advocate for sound business practices in industry professionals in hedge funds, funds of funds, and managed futures, as well as industry service providers. MFA is committed to playing a constructive role in the regulatory reform discussion as it continues, as investors' funds have a shared interest with other market participants and policymakers in seeking to restore investor confidence and achieving a stable financial system. In considering the topic of a Systemic Risk and Resolution Authority, it is important to understand the nature of our industry in taking action. With an estimated $1.5 trillion under management, the industry is significantly smaller than the U.S. mutual fund industry or the $13 trillion U.S. dollar banking industry. Because many hedge funds use little or no leverage, their losses have not contributed to the systemic risk that more highly-leveraged institutions contributed. A recent study found that 26.9 percent of managers do not deploy leverage at all, while an FSA study in 2009 found that, on average over a 5-year period, leverage of funds was between 2 or 3 to 1, significantly below most public perception. The industry's relatively modest size and low leverage, coupled with the expertise of our members at managing financial risk, means we have not been a contributing cause to the current difficulties experienced by the average investor or the American taxpayer. Although funds did not cause the problems in our markets, and though we certainly agree with recent statements by Chairman Bernanke that it is unlikely that any individual hedge fund is systemically relevant, we believe that the industry has a role in being a constructive participant as policymakers develop regulatory systems with the goal of restoring stability to the marketplace. We believe the objectives of systemic risk can be met through a framework that addresses participant, product, and structural issues, which include: a central systemic regulator with oversight of the key elements of the entire system; confidential reporting by every institution, generally to its functional regulator, which would then make appropriate reports to the systemic regulator; prudential regulation of systemically relevant entities, products, and markets; and a clear, single mandate for the systemic risk regulator to take action if the failure of a relevant firm would jeopardize broad aspects of economic function. We believe these authorities are consistent with the authorities contemplated by the discussion draft. We believe the objectives of systemic risk regulation are best met not by subjecting non-banks to the Bank Holding Company Act, but by developing a framework that adopts a tailored regulatory approach that addresses the different risk concerns of the business models, activities, and risks of the systemically significant firms. For example, when firms post collateral when they borrow from counterparties, like hedge funds customarily do and as major market participants will be required to do under the OTC bill recently passed by this committee, the potential systemic risks associated with that borrowing are greatly reduced, a factor that should mitigate in determining what prudential rules should apply to various market activities. We believe that smart regulation, facilitated by the OTC, the Advisor Registration, and the Investor Protection bills recently passed by the committee also will greatly reduce the likelihood that a Resolution Authority framework will even need to be implemented. To the extent that a regulator does need to implement such authority, however, we believe that it should be done in a manner to ensure that a firm's failure does not jeopardize the financial system. However, it should be explicitly stated that this authority should not be used to save firms from failing. It is unclear at the moment whether the authority granted by the proposal would enable assistance to be extended to a firm not leading to resolution of the entity being assisted. There are other issues that have been raised by members' questions and the testimony earlier today that we would also address. But for the sake of time, I shall conclude by saying we believe that the Systemic Risk and Resolution Authority framework discussed above will address the concerns underlying the Systemic Risk and Resolution Authority bills, while minimizing unfair competitive advantages and moral hazards that can result from market participants having an implied government guarantee. It is important this framework be implemented in a manner that allows investors, lenders, and counterparties to understand the relevant rules and have confidence those rules will be applied consistently in the future. When investors do not have that confidence, they are less likely to put their capital at risk. And when market function is impaired, we all pay a price. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Baker can be found on page 117 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Next, Professor Phillip Swagel, visiting professor at Georgetown. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE PHILLIP L. SWAGEL, VISITING"," PROFESSOR, McDONOUGH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY "
"Mr. Swagel","Thank you, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I am a visiting professor at the McDonough School of Business at Georgetown University, and a nonresident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. I was previously Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy at the Treasury Department from December 2006 until January of 2009. I will focus now briefly on the provisions in the legislation, the draft legislation, for enhanced Resolution Authority. The critical steps that provide certainty to market participants and lead them to believe that costs will be imposed in a crisis will change risk-taking behavior and help make a future crisis less likely. But the enhanced resolution authority in the draft bill does the opposite. In the end, it provides complete discretion for the government. Put simply, this is a proposal for a permanent and supercharged TARP. The government could deploy public money without further authorization from the Congress, making this a permanent TARP. The government could repudiate contracts, making this a supercharged TARP. This expansive new Resolution Authority does not provide the certainty that would help avoid future crises, and it would allow the Executive Branch to usurp Congress's prerogatives in this area. Let me mention briefly two specific concerns. The first is moral hazard. Even though the resolution regime can impose losses on creditors, the fact that ultimately it gives complete flexibility to the government inevitably gives rise to moral hazard. There is a tradeoff between certainty and flexibility, but there should be no doubt that the legislation being discussed today falls squarely on the side of flexibility. My second concern is that with flexibility to deploy public resources and change contracts outside of a judicial process, there comes a potential for enormous mischief--in the end, the temptation to use the new power in inappropriate ways, ways that were not contemplated when the power was granted. This is not a theoretical concern. Enhanced resolution authority would allow the government to put money into a private firm and to change contracts. And both of these were done in the recent automobile bankruptcies. Contracts were changed, with the capital structure rearranged to favor junior creditors over senior ones. And the two firms were used as conduits to transfer resources to favored parties. Now let me be clear at the very beginning. It is entirely legitimate for the President or others to propose the use of public funds to ensure that workers and retirees maintain access to health insurance. That is absolutely legitimate. But the dedication of such resources should be done through a vote of the Congress, and not embedded in a financial rescue. Moreover, the reordering of the capital structure has the potential to lead to higher costs of financing for future projects, and thus less investment and slower economic growth and less job creation. It would be difficult for any Administration to resist the temptation to transfer public resources through regulatory authority rather than new legislation. And yet the Administration did not resist this temptation. Even when it must have been clear, absolutely clear, that this action would have a direct negative implication for their own proposal to obtain non-bank resolution authority. In the event of a future crisis, it would be preferable for Congress to decide to deploy fiscal resources. In the meantime, a better way to provide certainty would be to pursue an improved bankruptcy regime. H.R. 3310 includes such an approach. My written statement touches upon other aspects of the legislative proposals. Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Bachus, thank you again for the opportunity to appear today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Swagel can be found on page 229 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Next, Mr. Scott Talbott, who is the senior vice president at the Financial Services Roundtable. "
"STATEMENT OF SCOTT TALBOTT, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS, THE FINANCIAL SERVICES ROUNDTABLE"," "
"Mr. Talbott","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, I am Scott Talbott, as the chairman said, senior vice president of government affairs for the Financial Services Roundtable. Thank you for the opportunity to allow us to appear before you today and address the committee draft on systemic risk, prudential standards, failure resolution, and securitization. Steve Bartlett would have liked to have been here himself, he was looking forward to it, but he fell victim to H1N1 and felt it was better not to expose his fellow panelists to the flu."
"The Chairman","Let me just say, you can tell Mr. Bartlett I have a general rule. No one need ever apologize for not coming here. "
"Mr. Talbott","I will let him know. The Roundtable supports greater systemic risk oversight. We support creation of a resolution mechanism. We support more effective prudential supervision. And we agree with asking mortgage securitizers to retain some risk. As such, we commend the committee in addressing these necessary reforms through the creation of a financial services oversight council. We oppose the idea of ``too-big-to-fail,'' and believe that if a firm is going to fail, it should be allowed to fail. Creative destruction is part of the market system. The key here is to strengthen the regulatory framework to spot developing trends, and then if the firm does fail, to minimize the effects of its demise on the entire system. Let me turn to the discussion draft and offer our perspectives on a few of the details. First of all, the draft allows for better coordination between prudential regulators. This is a very crucial step necessary to break down the silos that allow, in part, this crisis to develop as it was. There are other ways, however, to increase the coordination and communication between the prudential regulators. One would be to have a Federal insurance regulator on the council. I know there are proposals working their way through Congress to create an FIO, and we believe that once it is created, like we heard earlier today with the CPA, they should be added to the council. Additionally, we believe that the Financial Accounting Standards Board should be underneath the council's purview. Accounting standards are integral to protecting the investor, and we believe they should be part of the council. Next, the discussion draft preserves thrift charters and grandfathers industrial loan charters and their lawful affiliations in commercial companies. However, the limits on cross-marking between the parents and ILCs would restrict activities and their abilities to meet their customers' needs. These standards would freeze the ILCs in time, and would force a company to choose between keeping its ILC and satisfying the ever-changing demands of customers and the markets. The discussion draft correctly focuses on the U.S. financial firms and does not extend beyond its borders. We should ensure that this regulation, as well as any others, are examined to ensure that they do not conflict or overlay with home country regulations. The G-20 is focusing on this area, and we think they are headed in the right direction. The draft, unfortunately, focuses, we feel, too much on size and the complexity of the identified financial holding company, and we think that there is excessive authority that is focused, as I said, based solely on size or complexity. And these two factors are not necessarily an indicator of risk to safety and soundness, and we believe that other factors should be considered. And those include liquidity, assets, the quality of assets, and the strength of management. The discussion draft also places an excessive focus on capital as the answer to safety and soundness concerns. While capital is important, it should not become the siren song, and could overpower economic growth. Any increase in capital, we believe, should be based on activities rather than the size of the institution, and should be applied across the industry regardless of size. In addition to capital, we recommend a comprehensive approach that focuses not just on capital but activity restrictions where appropriate, prudential supervision, liquidity requirements, as well as prudential standards. We oppose the idea of requiring firms to issue contingent capital as a debt they can convert to equity if the company runs into trouble. This would greatly increase the costs of raising capital. The standards used in the draft must be examined carefully as well to ensure that the power that is granted under this authority is not exercised unless there is an extreme emergency. You want to make them high enough that they aren't triggered unnecessarily. On securitization, the draft proposes a 10 percent risk retention requirement for mortgage lenders as well as securitizers. We support the concept of risk retention, but believe that the risk retention provisions contained in H.R. 1728, which called for a 5 percent requirement, are the right one; 5 percent should be the ceiling and not the floor. Furthermore, the 10 percent risk requirement is unstudied. There have been no hearings on the matter. And we believe that this is a crucial piece that should be discussed further, and should not apply to the FHFA, to Ginnie Mae, as well as the GSE standards. It could have the unintended consequence of significantly limiting securitization and subsequent the ability of a home mortgage finance company, and limit the ability of customers who are trying to seek to purchase a home. The discussion draft would subject derivative transactions between the bank and its affiliates to a quantitative limit contained in Section 23(a), and we oppose this. We believe that the arm's length standard contained in 23(b) is sufficient. Additional, the discussion draft would mandate haircuts for unsecured creditors, and we think this would raise the costs of capital going forward. On the issue of costs, we have heard a lot of testimony today. We support having a post-event assessment. We believe that the $10 billion should be studied so it is not over- inclusive as well as under-inclusive. We believe it should be fair and equitable assessment, possibly on a sector-by-sector basis, or even limited to possible stakeholders. Finally, the discussion draft should be one--going forward, we should focus on the concept of balance. We want to make sure that we regulate properly, but we don't hinder the ability of markets to serve consumers to promote and sustain economic growth. I look forward to any questions you may have. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Talbott can be found on page 236 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Our next witness is Mr. Stephen Kandarian, who is executive vice president and chief investment officer of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. "
"STATEMENT OF STEVEN A. KANDARIAN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND"," CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MetLife, INC. "
"Mr. Kandarian","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today. You have asked MetLife for its perspective on the proposals under discussion today. MetLife is the largest life insurer in the United States. We are also the only life insurer that is also a financial holding company. Because of our financial holding company status, the Federal Reserve serves as the umbrella supervisor of our holding company, in addition to the various functional regulators that serve as the primary regulators of our insurance, banking, and securities businesses, including our State insurance regulators, the OCC, and the SEC. While I'll comment on certain aspects of the Administration and congressional proposals, I can best contribute to the dialogue on systemic risk and resolution authority by providing some thoughts about the potential impact of the proposals being discussed. My written statement also includes some suggested guidelines that we believe are important to keep in mind as you consider how to improve the securitization process. Let me start by saying that we support the efforts of Congress and the Administration to address the root causes of the recent financial crisis and to better monitor systemic risk within the financial system. We applaud your thoughtful and deliberate approach to these very complex issues. The discussion draft proposes to establish a new regulatory structure to oversee systemic risk within the financial system, enhance prudential regulation, and authorize Federal regulators to assist or wind-down large financial companies whose failure could pose a threat to financial stability or economic conditions in the United States. We recognize the need to identify, monitor and control systemic risk within the financial system, but we are concerned that creating a system under which companies will be subjected to differing requirements based on their size will result in an unlevel playing field and will create new problems. As proposed, the concept of designating tier one financial holding companies and subjecting such companies to enhanced prudential standards and new resolution authority may address some of the problems we have seen in the financial markets, but it may also create new vulnerabilities, including the creation of an unleveled playing field if tier one status is assigned to only a small number of companies in industry. Systemic threats can stem from a number of sources in addition to large financial institutions. For example, in 1998, the hedge fund Long-Term Capital Management was not particularly large, but it created a significant amount of potential systemic risk when it was at the brink of failure because of its leverage and the volatility in the financial markets. Attempting to address systemic risk by focusing a higher level of regulation on a discrete group of companies under a tiered system could result in little or no oversight of those other sources of risk, leaving the financial system exposed to potentially significant problems. We suggest that Congress consider regulating systemic risks by regulating the activities that contribute to systemic risk without regard to the type or size of institution that is conducting the activity. Linking regulatory requirements to the activity will help close existing loopholes and prevent new regulatory gaps that could be exploited by companies looking to operate under a more lenient regulatory regime. The discussion draft also introduces a new resolution authority based on the premise that large institutions must be treated differently than smaller ones. While we are pleased that the drafters have excluded certain types of institutions from the enhanced resolution authority provisions, including insurance companies, we are concerned about the potential conflicts the new resolution system may create. For example, what if the new Federal resolution authority decided to wind-down a financial holding company that also has a large insurance subsidiary? Given their different missions, the Federal resolution authority might seek one treatment of the insurance subsidiary that is in direct conflict to the desires of the State insurance regulators. As a result, creditors, counterparties, and other stakeholders will likely find it difficult to assess their credit risks to these institutions. These large financial institutions will have to pay a higher-risk premium because of this uncertainty, placing them at a competitive disadvantage both domestically and globally and leading to higher costs that will ultimately be borne by consumers and shareholders. We believe the current system of functional regulation has worked well in the insurance industry. In our experience, the Fed and the functional regulators have worked cooperatively, sharing information and insights that allow each regulator to perform its function. In light of the issues outlined here and in my written statement, I will conclude by suggesting that Congress regulate activities that contribute to systemic risk rather than creating a system of regulation that uses size of the financial institution as a key criterion. We believe that such a system can be more effective, easier to administer, and result in fewer unintended consequences then the proposed tiered structure. Thank you.

"The Chairman","Now, we will hear from Mr. Michael Menzies, who is the president and chief executive officer of Easton Bank and Trust, testifying on behalf of the Independent Community Bankers of America. "
"STATEMENT OF R. MICHAEL S. MENZIES, SR., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, EASTON BANK AND TRUST, CO., ON BEHALF OF THE INDEPENDENT COMMUNITY BANKERS OF AMERICA (ICBA)"," "
"Mr. Menzies","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, it's an honor to be with you again. And I'm especially proud to be the chairman of the Independent Community Bankers of America. We represent 5,000 community bank members throughout the Nation. ICBA appreciates the opportunity to comment on the joint discussion draft that has just been released. Based on our early review, we believe the draft is a substantial improvement over earlier proposals, and we commend you, Mr. Chairman, and your committee for these efforts. Just a year ago, due to the failure of our Nation's largest institutions to adequately manage their highly risky activities, key elements of the Nation's financial system nearly collapsed. Even though our system of locally-owned and controlled community banks were not in similar danger, the resulting recession and credit crunch have now impacted the financial cornerstone of our local economies, community banks. Accordingly, we recommend that Congress move quickly on this legislation. We strongly support the provisions of the discussion draft that designate the Federal Reserve as the systemic risk regulator, and that appear to give it sufficient authority to carry out its responsibilities. We also support the enhanced authority of the Financial Services Oversight Council over the Federal Reserve's decisions. While the Federal Reserve has the expertise and experience to deal effectively with these matters, they are so critical that other agencies must be involved as well. ICBA is especially pleased that the discussion draft provides the Federal Reserve the authority to require a systemically risky holding company to sell assets or terminate activities if they pose a threat to the company's safety and soundness or the Nation's financial stability. This authority gets to the heart of many of the problems that led to the Nation's financial meltdown. Some institutions have become so large that they cannot be effectively managed or regulated, and must simply be downsized. ICBA recommends that the legislation direct the Federal Reserve to intensely study each identified financial holding company to determine if it should be subject to this new authority. The draft legislation appears to give the FDIC ample authority to responsibly resolve systemically risky holding companies. The bill gives the Treasury Secretary the sole authority to appoint the FDIC as receiver for a failed holding company. This vests a politically appointed official with tremendous power over the Nation's economy. We recommend that the legislation specifically empower the FDIC, as an independent agency, to recommend to the Secretary that he or she exercise his authority. Downsizing and resolving systemically risky institutions are key to eliminating ``too- big-to-fail'' from the financial system. Another important part of the solution of the ``too-big-to- fail'' problem is contained in the Bank Accountability and Risk Assessment Act introduced by Representative Gutierrez. This bill would make the funding of deposit insurance more risk- based and equitable. We urge the committee to incorporate this measure into broader financial reform. ICBA recommends that funding for the resolution process for systemically risky holding companies be provided by the largest institutions in advance, rather than after the fact. We believe that a pre-funded resolution process has many advantages. It avoids the initial call on taxpayer funds that would be likely if an institution were to fail unexpectedly, which of course is what happens. It places the cost on institutions that may later fail rather than only on institutions that haven't failed, providing an important equitable balance. And prefunding avoids procyclical effects, tapping the industry for modest, predictable contributions when the times are good. We strongly support the revisions in the discussion draft that block the creation of additional industrial loan companies that may be owned by commercial firms. This is the last loophole that would allow the mixing of banking and commerce. Even though the OTC would be merged into the OCC, ICBA is particularly pleased that the discussion draft retains the thrift charter; the vast majority of Federal thrifts have served their communities well. In that vein, we appreciate continued support of the chairman and the Administration for the current regulatory system as it applies to community banks. It provides valuable checks and balances that would be lost to a single regulatory scheme. I want to convey our appreciation for your efforts and thank you for the opportunity to testify today. [The prepared statement of Mr. Menzies can be found on page 166 of the appendix. ]"
"The Chairman","Next is Mr. Peter Wallison, Arthur Burns fellow in financial policy studies at The American Enterprise Institute. "
"STATEMENT OF PETER J. WALLISON, ARTHUR F. BURNS FELLOW IN FINANCIAL POLICY STUDIES, THE AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE"," "
"Mr. Wallison","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Ranking Member Bachus, for holding this hearing. The discussion draft of October 27th contains an extremely troubling set of proposals, which if adopted will turn over control of the financial system to the government, sap the strength and vitality of our economy, and stifle risk-taking and innovation. Rather than ending ``too-big-to-fail,'' the draft makes it national policy. By designating certain companies for special prudential regulation, the draft would signal to the markets that these firms are ``too-big-to-fail,'' creating Fannies and Freddies in every sector of the economy where they are designated. These large companies will have funding and other advantages over small ones, changing competitive conditions in every sector of the financial system. The draft suggests that the names of these companies can be kept secret. That can't happen. The securities laws alone will require them to disclose their special status. For designated companies, new activities, innovations, and competitive initiatives will be subject to government approval. Companies engaged in activities that the regulators don't like will be forced to divest. That power will ensure that nothing will be done in New York that wasn't approved in Washington. Commercial companies would be separated from financial activities even though these activities are never separated in the real world. All companies--retailers, manufacturers and suppliers--finance their sales. It's a puzzle how U.S. companies will compete with other foreign companies when they can't finance their own sales. Another flawed idea in this draft is that there is some kind of discernable line between finance and commerce. That line is political, it's imaginary. For example, to protect the Realtors against competition from banks, Congress has stopped the Fed from declaring that real estate brokerage is a financial activity. Can anyone describe why securities brokerage is financial but real estate brokerage is not? Of course not. Every industry will be asking for special treatment or exemption if this draft is adopted. The resolution authority is based on the faulty assumption that anyone can know in advance whether a company will--if it fails--cause a systemic breakdown. This is unknowable, but government officials are supposed to make this determination anyway. With unfettered discretion, officials will follow a better- safe-than-sorry policy, taking over companies that would only create economic disruptions, not full-scale systemic breakdowns. General Motors and Chrysler are an example. They were not systemically important but they were politically important. Their failure would not have caused a systemic breakdown, but would have caused a loss of jobs and other economic disruption. Companies like these will be rescued, while smaller ones with less political clout will be sent to bankruptcy. The markets will have to guess which will be saved and which will not, creating moral hazard and arbitrary gains and losses. Worse than giving government officials this enormous discretionary authority is what the draft authorizes them to do with it. They can rescue some companies and liquidate others, pay off some creditors and not others, and using government funds keep failing companies operating for years and competing with healthy companies. This will not only create uncertainty and moral hazard, but will again give large and powerful firms advantages over small ones. Those that seem likely to be taken over by the government will have an easier access to credit at lower rates than those likely to be sent to bankruptcy. In other words, the draft proposes a permanent TARP. It will use government money to bail out large or politically favored companies and then will tax the remaining healthy companies to reimburse the government for its cost of competing with them. That concludes my testimony, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Mr. Wallison can be found on page 312 of the appendix. ]"
"The Chairman","The next witness is Jane D'Arista, from Americans for Financial Reform. "
"STATEMENT OF JANE D'ARISTA, AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM"," "
"Ms. D'Arista","Thank you, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee for inviting me. And I want to say that I'm representing a very large group of organizations that are consumer and non-financial or nonprofit and concerned with the issues of reform, not just consumer issues but the entire panoply. I would say that President Trumka has laid out many of our concerns about this draft legislation today. I'm going to take the opportunity, if I may, to go into something else, which is to say that obviously it is important that we begin by dealing with crisis management, as you have done in this legislation. But we must not forget that the important thing to do is not just manage these problems but to prevent them. And I find that the legislation so far comes up short in the preventive era. I would like to talk about two particular issues. One of them is what I see as an equally important underlying cause of the crisis, and that's the combination of excessive leverage, proprietary trading, and the new funding strategies that go into the repurchase agreements, markets and the commercial paper markets, etc., for financial institutions. We have here a situation in which leverage has, in effect, monetized debt, because assets are used as backing for new borrowing to add more assets. The evidence of this is that the financial sector has grown 50 percent in the decade from 1997 to 2007, rising to 114 percent of GDP. That is pretty shocking in and of itself. Proprietary trading is an issue that must be addressed, and it is of concern for a lot of different reasons, one of which of course is that it erodes the fiduciary responsibility of intermediaries. But equally important is the issue of the fact that what is at stake here is institutions trading for their own bottom line without any contribution to their customers or to the economy as a whole. What money goes in to the financial sector comes from our earnings and our savings, and they have skimmed it off to game it. It is our money that is at risk in this game. The funding strategies that have been used in order to support leverage and proprietary trading have been the major contribution, in my view, to the interconnectedness of the financial sector. These institutions are borrowing from one another, not from, primarily, from the outside non-financial sector, as a result of which over half of those positions are supplied by other financial institutions. This is the counterparty issue, this is what we were dealing with when we were dealing with Lehman, AIG, etc., and it is something that absolutely must be addressed. Finally, briefly, about securitization. Securitization has changed the structure of the U.S. financial system. We have gone from a bank-based system to a market-based system with new rules of the game. We have eroded the bank-based rules that shielded the consumer and the household in this country since the 1930's. These new rules expose households to interest rate risks, market rate risk, etc., but they do so to institutions as well because of the mark to market phenomena they require. You cannot have a market without marking it to market. But the chart drops against capital that we have seen here, and we have not fully evaluated, have turned capital of our financial institutions into a conduit to insolvency--not a cushion, but a conduit to insolvency. So what I think is that this committee has a very large plate to deal with going into the future as a preventive set of resolutions. I would urge you to do so not in the direction you're going now, which is to give discretion to too many institutions that we know--the Federal Reserve in particular-- but to actually craft the rules of the game that need to be followed in the future. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Ms. D'Arista can be found on page 138 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Next, Mr. Edward Yingling, who is the president and chief executive officer of the American Bankers Association. "
"STATEMENT OF EDWARD L. YINGLING, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION (ABA)"," "
"Mr. Yingling","Chairman Frank, Congressman Bachus, and members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify. It has been over a year since I first testified before this committee in favor of broad financial reform. This week, the committee is considering legislation that addresses the critical issues that we identified in that testimony, and the ABA continues to support such reform. The key issues addressed include the creation of a systemic oversight council, addressing key gaps in the regulation of non-banks, addressing ``too-big-to-fail,'' and establishing a regulatory approach to the payment system. My written testimony addresses these issues more fully, and I want to emphasize we appreciate the progress that has been made in these areas, the areas that are most critical to reform. One very important change in the draft from the original Administration proposal is that the draft maintains the thrift charter. The ABA wishes to thank Chairman Frank for his leadership on this important issue. In my remaining time, I want to talk about a few areas that need further work, in our opinion. First, there is one glaring omission in the Administration's original proposal and in the draft, the failure to address accounting policy. A systemic risk oversight council cannot possibly do its job if does not have oversight authority over accounting rule-making. Accounting policies are increasingly influencing financial policy and the very structure of our financial system. Thus, accounting standards must now be part of a systemic risk calculation. We believe the Federal Accounting Standards Board should continue to function as it does today, but it should no longer report only to the SEC. The SEC's view is simply too narrow. Accounting policies contribution to this crisis has now been well-documented, and yet the SEC is not charged with considering systemic or structural effects. ABA has strongly supported H.R. 1349, introduced by Representatives Perlmutter and Lucas, in this area. Second, I want to reiterate the ABA's strong opposition to using the FDIC directly for non-bank resolutions. Several weeks ago, the ABA provided a comprehensive approach to resolutions and to ending ``too-big-to-fail.'' The draft, in many ways, mirrors that proposal. However, using the FDIC directly as opposed to indirectly is fraught with problems and is unnecessary. Putting the FDIC directly in charge of such resolutions would greatly undermine public confidence in the FDIC's insurance for the public's deposits. This confidence is critical and it's the reason we have had no runs on banks for over 70 years, even during this very difficult period. The importance of this public confidence should not be taken for granted. Witness the lines that formed in front of the British bank, Northern Rock, at the beginning of this crisis, where they did have classic runs. Yet our own research and polling shows that while consumers trust FDIC insurance, their understanding of how it works is not all that deep. Headlines saying, ``FDIC in charge of failed XYZ non-bank'' would greatly undermine that trust. Just imagine if the FDIC were trying to address the AIG situation this year, dealing with AIG bonuses and that type of thing. We urge the Congress not to do anything that would confuse consumers or undermine confidence in the FDIC. We also believe it's a mistake to use existing bank resolution policies in the case of non-bank creditors. Basic bankruptcy principles should be applied in those cases. Finally, we want to work with the committee to achieve the right balance on securitization reform. We want to work with you to provide for skin in the game on securitization. We understand why there is interest in that, but we need to address the very thorny accounting and business issues involved in having skin in the game. ABA has been a strong advocate for reform. A good deal of progress has been made through the constructive debate in this committee, and we really appreciate the consideration members have given to our views. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Mr. Yingling can be found on page 321 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","I thank you, and we now have--our last witness is Mr. Timothy Ryan of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. "
"STATEMENT OF T. TIMOTHY RYAN, JR., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION (SIFMA)"," "
"Mr. Ryan","I want to thank the committee for this opportunity to appear today. We believe that systemic risk regulation and resolution authority are the two most important pieces of legislation focused on avoiding another financial crisis and solving the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. I testified in support of a systemic risk regulator before this committee nearly a year ago. It is vital to the taxpayers, the industry, and the overall economy that policymakers get this legislation right. We believe that the revised discussion draft gets most aspects right. We support the general structure it sets up, but given its breadth and its complexity and the short time we have had to review it, we have already identified a number of provisions in the revised draft that we believe could actually increase systemic risk instead of reduce it. We understand your need to act quickly, but please try to do no harm through the legislative process. My written testimony provides details on the proposals weaknesses. We urge the committee to take the time to correct them. We will work day and night to suggest constructive changes. Just two examples. We support the idea of an oversight council. We think it should be chaired by the Secretary of the Treasury. We believe it will be beneficial to have input from a number of key financial regulatory agencies. We're also pleased to see that the Federal Reserve would be given a strong role in the regulation of systemically important financial companies. But we are not sure of the size and composition of the council. We're concerned that the influence of agencies with the greatest experience and stake in systemic risk will be diluted and possibly undermined with a lesser stake. This structure must be reviewed carefully to ensure the council is designed to achieve its goal of identifying and minimizing systemic risk. Second, resolution authority. We strongly support this new authority, essential to contain risk during a financial crisis and to solve the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem. The bank insolvency statute is the right model for certain aspects of this new authority. A Federal agency should be in charge of the process. It should be able to act quickly to transfer selected assets and limit the liabilities to third party. It should have the option of setting up a temporary bridge company to hold assets and liabilities that cannot be transferred to a third party so that they can be unwound in an orderly fashion. But the bank insolvency statute is the wrong model for claims processing and for rules dividing up the left-behind assets and liabilities of non-bank financial companies. The right model is the Bankruptcy Code. The Code contains a very transparent judicial claims process and neutral rules governing creditors rights that markets understand and rely upon. By contrast, the bank insolvency statute, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, contains a very opaque administrative claims process and creditor-unfriendly rules. These may be appropriate for banks, where the FDIC as the insurer of bank deposits is typically the largest creditor. But the bank insolvency claims process and creditor-unfriendly rules are inappropriate for non-banks which fund themselves in the capital markets, not with deposits. So there is a very important reason to preserve the bankruptcy model for claims processed for non-banks. If you don't, the new resolution authority will seriously disrupt and permanently harm the credit markets for non-banks, increasing systemic risk instead of reducing it. We urge the committee to revise the resolution authority so that it takes the best parts of the bank insolvency model and the best parts of the bankruptcy model. That way it will reflect the strengths of both models without reflecting either of their weaknesses. We and our insolvency experts stand ready to work with you immediately to improve the highly complex and technical resolution authority section. Finally, we also question whether the FDIC has the necessary experience to exercise resolution authority over the large, complex, interconnected, and cross-border financial groups that are the targets of this legislation. We believe that adding the Federal Reserve to the FDIC board is a step in the right direction, but in order to ensure that the right experience is brought, we think we need a new primary Federal resolution authority. And I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, for your courtesy. [The prepared statement of Mr. Ryan can be found on page 188 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Mr. Trumka, I appreciate your staying. I know you had some schedule issues. Let me--one thing you point out, which has to be correcting in the drafting, any ambiguity on preemption of existing statutes would be cleared up. They will be allowed to do capital standards, etc., but no investor protection, no consumer protection. We will make it very clear that is not intended. As some of you have heard me say, I have a favorite phrase to put in the legislation, this bill does not do what this bill does not do. It will not do that. Secondly, as to reforming the Federal Reserve structure, I had a study done; 90 percent of the dissents at the Federal Open Market Committee are from regional bank presidents and 90 percent of the 90 percent are for higher interest rates. Those are inappropriately placed private businessmen or women, occasionally, picked by other private businessmen and occasionally women, and they should not be setting public policy. I don't care that the Fed rejected what the Treasury said. That may be a nice discussion among gentlemen. The Fed will not reject it when we, I promise you, next year take up legislatively the issue--and I think it's very clear--you should not have private citizens like the presidents of the regional banks voting on policy, and I guarantee you that won't happen. So those are two things that we do very much intend to deal with, and I appreciate your calling them to our attention. Let me just go to Mr. Ryan and--I have to say, you have actually strengthened my view, in one sense, as to how you do the resolution authority. You say that you don't like what we have picked because it is creditor unfriendly. Yes, that's what we want to be. Here's the problem, the whole question of moral hazard is one that seemed too creditor-friendly. The argument for moral hazard is that once people think a particular bank is going to be involved in this, they put their money there, they become the creditors of that institution, because they think they are going to be protected. So frankly, I wasn't quite sure about where the differences are. Yes, we want to be creditor-unfriendly because we want to generate the uncertainty here, because it is the lack of certainty and it is the sense that we are too creditor-friendly that causes the problem. Now, we also want to address the question of the list. One of my favorite Marx Brothers movie quotes is between Chico and Groucho negotiating a contract, and they're going through each clause, and Chico doesn't like this clause and that clause, and they keep ripping it up, and finally, Chico says, ``What's this?'' He said, ``That's the sanity clause.'' And Chico says, ``You can't fool me. There ain't no sanity clause.'' Well, ``There ain't no list, either.'' There may have been a misinterpretation of what I said. Here's my view of this. I will insist that in this legislation, in order to get my support--which is helpful in getting it out of here, not enough, but it's necessary, albeit not sufficient--there will be no identification of a systemically important institution until the hammer falls on it. That is, there will be no two-step process--they're important, what do we do about it? They will know that there is concern about them the day they are given higher capital requirements or told to divest this entity. Now that's not supposed to be secret. There may have been a misinterpretation. When I said I didn't want there to be a list, people said, we won't tell you what's going on. No, that will be made public. The draft has to be revised. Yes, the regulators will say that's a potentially troublesome institution. I believe that this will be a scarlet letter. I think it will be the opposite of moral hazard. There will be no list, this is a systemically important institution. There will be a list of the institutions that were considered troubled, and therefore were given higher capital requirements or told they couldn't issue as many of this instrument, or may be broken up, because I want to put in here a kind of institution-by-institution Glass-Steagall that they can put in there. So I did want to clear those up. Ms. D'Arista, let me just say, I agree in part. As to securitization, we are addressing it. Some people think we're being too tough on it. One other issue, though, that you raised that's intriguing, Paul Volcker has said it, the question of proprietary trading by banks, both risky and anti-competitive. I'm asking the bank to trade for me and they're trading for themselves. In a pinch, who gets the better deal? And I appreciate it, but I tell you, I have become a little weary of people telling me to solve the problem. You help me solve the problem. You raised it, you say, make rules. Seriously, let me just ask you this, what would you have us do about proprietary trading? I mean that seriously. I think that's on the table. Should we ban proprietary trading by depository institutions or put limits on it? What would we do?"
"Ms. D'Arista","Certainly ban it by depository--"
"The Chairman","What's that?"
"Ms. D'Arista","Ban it by depository institutions, yes, because they are in conflict with their clients. But it is a very large problem. I think proprietary trading goes on globally."
"The Chairman","All right, well then send us something in writing. I understand the large--"
"Ms. D'Arista","Okay, all right. The problems--"
"The Chairman","You do us no service when you tell us the problem--"
"Ms. D'Arista","Leverage will help, and if you were to extend the idea of the National Bank Act to limit lending to financial institutions, that would be very helpful."
"The Chairman","Let me ask you to do that in writing, because I do think the issue of proprietary trading is one that we would like to work on. If you can send us that in the next week or so--"
"Ms. D'Arista","I would be happy to do that, thank you."
"The Chairman","That would be helpful. Mr. Ryan, I am over my time, but I talked about you. So I will give you a few seconds."
"Mr. Ryan","Thank you. Just on uncertainty, there is some uncertainty that we don't like. It's uncertainty that causes a pricing impact--"
"The Chairman","No, but here is what we have been told. When we get into--when we're talking about those that would be subject to resolution authority, we're told that there is a moral hazard there because people will now say, ``Oh, they're going to be resolved. That means I should put the money there.'' I want that to be less creditor-friendly. I want creditors--I want the uncertainty that says, ``You know what? That institution is somewhat troubled. Maybe I won't deal with them because I want the institution to have an incentive to stop doing what's troubling people.''"
"Mr. Ryan","May I just say--"
"The Chairman","Yes."
"Mr. Ryan","--what I fear? What I fear is that uncertainty will cause significant disruptions in the intra-daily markets and--"
"The Chairman","Mr. Ryan, isn't it likely to cause--and I apologize, if I can go--isn't it likely to cause a transfer from one institution to another? After all, there will be some institutions that will be on this list and some that won't. So, what I am trying to do is to convert the fear that being put on the list is a badge of honor into making it a scarlet letter. And I don't see how it would be disruptive, unless there are a whole lot of institutions there. But if only a few institutions are there, they can put their money elsewhere."
"Mr. Ryan","We will try to come back to you with some ideas which will get to your--"
"The Chairman","All right, I appreciate it."
"Mr. Ryan","Thank you."
"The Chairman","I appreciate the indulgence. Let me just say that I want to put into the record an article on the feasibility of systemic risk management by Andrew Lo at MIT-- because there is no point in pretending you can do any of this unless you can get the data and make sense of it, and he says you can--and also testimony from the Property Casualty Insurance Association of America on this hearing. So, I ask unanimous consent that they be put in the record. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I would like to ask each of the panelists--and maybe just a yes or no, or a very brief response, have you had time since the discussion draft was issued to thoroughly analyze the bill, as far as strengths and weaknesses?"
"Mr. Trumka","No."
"Mr. Baker","No, sir, not enough."
"Mr. Swagel","No."
"Mr. Talbott","No."
"Mr. Kandarian","No."
"Mr. Menzies","No."
"Mr. Wallison","Certainly not all, Mr. Chairman."
"Ms. D'Arista","No."
"Mr. Yingling","No."
"Mr. Ryan","No."
"Mr. Bachus","All right. We hadn't, either, so I appreciate that. The chairman mentions creditors. I guess you can't have credit without creditors. So, let me see. There are so many questions I would like to ask. Professor Swagel, you were at Treasury last year. You said that the enhanced resolution authority would create a permanent super-charged TARP?"
"Mr. Swagel","Yes."
"Mr. Bachus","Secretary Geithner and Chairman Frank have repeatedly said that the resolution authority does not provide for bailouts. But you disagree. Is that correct?"
"Mr. Swagel","I do disagree. I listened carefully to the Secretary's testimony, and I understand--his testimony was about what he would intend to do, and I believe him and respect him. My concern is that the legislation allows much more. And I look at what happened with the TARP. I don't think anyone anticipated all the manifold activities that the TARP would get into. And that's essentially what the text of the legislation allows, as well."
"Mr. Bachus","Mr. Wallison, Secretary Geithner said that the chairman's discussion draft does not provide for the possibility of future bailouts. So what's your perspective on that?"
"Mr. Wallison","I was very puzzled to hear the Secretary say that, because there is language in here that does permit things that anyone would consider to be a bailout. That means assistance to an institution that is failing, and then permitting that institution to be brought back to solvency. Now, under any person's interpretation of what a bailout might be, that is a bailout, because government funds are then used to bring the institution back to solvency, and set it off again competing with others. In my prepared testimony as well as in my oral testimony, I said that this doesn't seem like either an equitable or sensible thing to do. Because then the costs of the government in keeping that other institution alive, to compete with the existing healthy institutions, are then taxed to the healthy institutions, which have just been weakened by that assistance. So, I could not understand what the Secretary was saying, and I would be delighted for someone to interpret it."
"Mr. Bachus","Maybe they hadn't had sufficient time to read the bill."
"Mr. Wallison","Maybe not."
"Mr. Bachus","Mr. Kandarian, you said, and I have said this before, that I think a better approach would be to regulate activities, not institutions. Does anyone else on the panel agree with that, that it would be a better approach? Maybe start with Mr. Trumka. And let me say this. When you decide that certain institutions will be bailed out and some will not, you make a decision not only that institutions are ``too-big-to-fail,'' you make a determination that 99 percent of institutions--or 99.9--are ``too-small-to-save.'' And that doesn't seem very fair. Mr. Trumka?"
"Mr. Trumka","Would you please repeat the first part of the question?"
"Mr. Bachus","Yes. Do you have a problem with--I will just say the last part. Do you have a problem with ``too-big-to- fail,'' as far as from a fairness standpoint?"
"Mr. Trumka","We have a problem with ``too-big-to-fail.'' We would like to prevent people from becoming ``too-big-to-fail.'' Because once they are there, you do not have a lot of choice but to bail them out. So, the goal should be to try to prevent that from happening."
"Mr. Bachus","All right."
"Mr. Trumka","And make sure that systemic risk doesn't aggregate, even--"
"Mr. Bachus","You believe that it's--that activities within an--it's an activity that creates the risk, and it's an institution--I guess I will just go to Mr. Baker, going down. What do you think about the approach where you regulate activities, and not institutions, as a--"
"Mr. Baker","Activities should be the focus, not necessarily assets under management."
"Mr. Bachus","All right, thank you."
"Mr. Swagel","I would agree with that."
"Mr. Talbott","I agree. It's not the size; it's the riskiness of the activities."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Mr. Kandarian? We will just go on down the line."
"Mr. Kandarian","Yes, those were my comments, so certainly I support--"
"Mr. Bachus","Yes, you would support it."
"Mr. Menzies","I disagree. Our activities are unbelievably regulated right this minute. It's the size of the institutions."
"Mr. Bachus","What about subprime lending? Do you think it was regulated, or--"
"Mr. Watt","I--"
"Mr. Bachus","Can I get the rest of the answers--"
"Mr. Watt","I am trying to get the rest of your answers in--"
"Mr. Bachus","All right, Mr. Wallison?"
"Mr. Watt","--but you can't--"
"Mr. Bachus","You're right. I have--"
"Mr. Watt","--ask another question and then expect the rest of the--"
"Mr. Bachus","You're right. Mr. Wallison?"
"Mr. Wallison","As I have testified to this committee before, I don't think any institution can create systemic risk, no matter what its size, unless it is an insured commercial bank."
"Ms. D'Arista","No, I think size is important. Yes, activities must be regulated. I have advocated that for many years. But management of a very large institution runs another problem that has to be addressed."
"Mr. Bachus","All right. Mr. Yingling?"
"Mr. Yingling","I think we need more subtle approaches than just having a somewhat arbitrary list."
"Mr. Bachus","You mean of institutions or activities?"
"Mr. Yingling","Of institutions."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. Mr. Ryan?"
"Mr. Ryan","I agree with Ed's comments."
"Mr. Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. And I will recognize myself for 5 minutes, just to say that every effort that we have tried to regulate as an activity, my colleagues have said they don't want to regulate either. So, this is one of those situations where it seems to me we're damned if we do and damned if we don't. If we do it based on size, they oppose it. If we do it based on activities, we oppose it. I guess that's what the Minority is designed to do, just oppose something, as opposed to propose something that will solve a problem. But that's--I won't belabor that point. Now, I know there are people on this panel who are unalterably--maybe they have moderated a little bit--but at least still opposed to the concept of a CFPA. I understand that. But assuming that there is a CFPA, is there anybody on this panel who thinks that the director of that agency shouldn't be on the council that is set up under this bill? I am not looking for a speech about whether you like CFPA or not. I just want to know whether you think they ought not to be on the council. Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Swagel","Yes, I would not put the director of the CFPA on the systemic risk--"
"Mr. Watt","We need to do something about your microphone."
"Mr. Swagel","Sorry about that. I would not put the director of the CFPA on the systemic risk council."
"Mr. Watt","Okay. Anybody else who will agree with that? "
"Mr. Watt","Okay. I won't go into your reasons. Give me your reasons in writing."
"Mr. Swagel","Okay."
"Mr. Watt","I won't take the time to do that. Mr. Yingling, you raised an issue that I raised this morning with the Secretary about dividing the funds, the FDIC fund, which has a brand, obviously, that the public relies on from whatever fund gets created to--either after the fact or before the fact--to deal with this resolution of systemically risky institutions. I think some of the others of us are concerned about that. You support setting up a fund in advance of a resolution or after the fact?"
"Mr. Yingling","I would do it after the fact. I think your--"
"Mr. Watt","Okay, and who would you tax with the--with putting up the money to put into that fund?"
"Mr. Yingling","I think, unfortunately, you end up with something similar. We would have some changes in what the Administration proposed, but some--"
"Mr. Watt","All right. I understand that. I'm asking you who you would tax. Would it be all financial institutions? Would it be some financial institutions? Would it be institutions above $10 billion? Would it be--who would you tax?"
"Mr. Yingling","What we said in our proposal was very similar to what the Administration proposed. We didn't put a number on it. Having said that, one thing we would like to see is a much stronger provision relating to the fact--and Chairman Bair mentioned this--that you get credit for the fact that you're already paying deposit insurance. So those--"
"Mr. Watt","Would it be set--"
"Mr. Yingling","Those liability--"
"Mr. Watt","--up as a separate fund, I take it?"
"Mr. Yingling","Oh, absolutely--"
"Mr. Watt","Totally separate from the FDIC?"
"Mr. Yingling","Oh, absolutely, but--"
"Mr. Watt","Called something else? A resolution fund?"
"Mr. Yingling","A resolution fund, and we think the agency should not be called the FDIC, it should be called the systemic resolution agency. That is what it is. And that the--"
"Mr. Watt","Anybody else on the panel--"
"Mr. Yingling","You get credit for the fact that you are an--"
"Mr. Watt","--disagree with that?"
"Mr. Yingling","--insured depository."
"Mr. Watt","Mr. Menzies, you disagree with--"
"Mr. Menzies","I--"
"Mr. Watt","--separating the funds?"
"Mr. Menzies","I'm a victim of my experience as a community banker. We set aside reserves--"
"Mr. Watt","I don't want to provide a platform for you to give--"
"Mr. Menzies","Okay."
"Mr. Watt","--a speech about it. I understand you say that."
"Mr. Menzies","We should pre-fund--"
"Mr. Watt","But this is about the fund, Mr. Menzies."
"Mr. Menzies","We should pre-fund that."
"Mr. Watt","You should pre-fund it?"
"Mr. Menzies","Absolutely. We should--"
"Mr. Watt","What are the arguments in favor of pre-funding it, as opposed to doing it after the fact?"
"Mr. Menzies","The same logic as applying loan loss reserves."
"Mr. Watt","And who would contribute to that fund?"
"Mr. Menzies","Those who present some form of systemic risk to our system."
"Mr. Watt","And how would you designate those without knowing who they are in advance?"
"Mr. Menzies","The industry is not going to be designating those. That's what Congress and the regulators need to do."
"Mr. Watt","So we ought to just pick it out of the--Congress ought to make a decision about it and put them on a list? Okay. We keep going around and around in a circle here. My time has expired. And, let's see, Mr. Royce is next."
"Mr. Trumka","Mr. Chairman, I was supposed to be out of here--"
"Mr. Watt","Oh, I'm sorry. I was supposed to make apologies. Mr. Trumka had indicated beforehand that he had to leave, and I was supposed to announce that--"
"Mr. Trumka","At 2:30."
"Mr. Watt","--so that it didn't look like he was running out on Mr. Royce. I hope nobody has any objection to that. He has to leave anyway, but you can put your objection in the record, so--"
"Mr. Bachus","If he has to leave, he has to leave."
"Mr. Watt","You are excused without objection, I believe. You are excused without objection."
"Mr. Trumka","Thank you."
"Mr. Watt","And don't take that out of Mr. Royce's time. Start his clock over."
"Mr. Royce","Fair enough. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I had a question for Mr. Wallison, and it went to memory of some of the hearings, and some of the comments. Back when he was Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan often mentioned that he believed deposit insurance had an effect of weakening market discipline. He noted that the benefits of deposit insurance are great. But he said, ``Explicit safety nets weaken market discipline. It encourages institutions to take on excessive risk.'' And I am not arguing here against the benefits of deposit insurance, obviously. But I am concerned that this legislation, by extension, would expand that perceived safety net throughout our financial system, that it wouldn't just be any longer a question of accounts covered by deposit insurance. Suddenly it becomes a problem that ripples throughout the entire financial system. And I would like to hear your comments on that, or your thoughts on it."
"Mr. Wallison","Thank you very much, Congressman. I think it should be obvious that deposit insurance does enable the taking of risk, and reduces market discipline. In fact, I think that's why banks are regulated, because once the government is backing their deposits, the only way for the government to protect itself against excessive risk- taking--because the creditors, then, and at least the depositors--have no significant incentive not to lend to an institution that is backed by the government. That is, of course, the whole reason why everyone is supposed to be concerned about ``too-big-to-fail.'' And I was quite surprised by the chairman's comments about ``too-big-to-fail.'' But if we have a system in which any institution is looked upon as though when it fails, there will be no serious losses to people--and that's what this legislation does--we're in the same position as we are when we have institutions that are covered by deposit insurance--people will have much less concern about lending to them. They will get much more favorable terms. And, unfortunately, that will enable them to take more risks. And eventually, we end up with failed institutions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are the poster children for exactly that. That was systemic risk writ large, and the American people are now going to have to spend something like $200 billion to $400 billion to pay for the losses that are embedded in their balance sheets right now."
"Mr. Royce","Now, the chairman's draft legislation would give regulators the ability to shield creditors from losses. Do you agree that making public funds available to soften the blow to private creditors would weaken market discipline, as deposit insurance does?"
"Mr. Wallison","Of course. It's the same thing as deposit insurance, and it doesn't really matter very much that eventually the public funds made available to these institutions are then recouped from the rest of the industry or whoever is going to be required to pay these costs. The important point is the fact that creditors know in advance that they have a much better chance of being paid politically or in some other way through a resolution system than they would have if the companies went into bankruptcy."
"Mr. Royce","So political pull, or the importance of it, starts to replace market discipline or market forces. And I suspect we could see a lot more activity by those who suddenly begin to focus on that issue. As the Richmond Federal Reserve has pointed out, roughly half of our financial system--at least in 1999--had some degree of government backing, whether it was explicit or implicit. I think the critical question in this regulatory reform effort is whether or not our system will benefit from a government safety net covering what is likely today well over half of the liabilities in our credit markets. Considering the unintended consequences that have come about from these types of market distortions, I have a hard time believing this is a good development. And I think we should look to ways to scale back that safety net and enhance market discipline in the system. And I would ask if you had any additional thoughts on that matter?"
"Mr. Wallison","I agree. And one of the problems with the draft legislation is that it actually expands the safety net in very significant ways: reduces market discipline, and guarantees there will be more risk-taking by large institutions--it favors large over small. And what will happen in the end is the same thing that happened with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We will face huge losses in very large companies that have not been properly disciplined by the market."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,"
"Mr. Wallison",""
"Mr. Watt","The gentleman, Mr. Himes, is recognized."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have two kind of esoteric questions, which may or may not elicit a response. I hope they do. The first is on the topic of securitizations. Securitization structured products, like so much of what we're talking about, are real double-edged swords, inasmuch as, used correctly, they increased credit and liquidity. Used incorrectly, or kept off balance sheet, or poorly rated, they contributed to the place we find ourselves in today. I am a big believer in the idea incorporated in this proposed legislation of retention, that you keep a piece of whatever it is that you create. I think it's very elegant. It prevents us or the regulators from having to try to sort through securities, because, really, the creator of a structured product, to some extent, will eat his or her own cooking. I do have real concerns, though, about the stipulated level. The legislation says that you will hold 10 percent of a structured product, perhaps down to 5 percent, no lower than 5 percent. And my problem with that is that I think structured products can have wildly different credit characteristics. You could have a structured product full of agency and treasuries, you could have a structured product full of high-risk stuff. So, I am really--and I am thinking about, is there some way to link the retention to the credit risk of the product, or to the fees associated with the product, which presumably are higher, if the product is more complex. I am wondering if there is any comment on what is proposed, vis-a-vis the 5 to 10 percent retention, and whether these ideas I have thrown out maybe have any merit."
"Mr. Ryan","Our view--and it has been consistent here--and I believe the chairman asked the same question about a year ago, did we support retention, and I said yes. We have been working also in Brussels with the European Commission. They are basically at a 5 percent number. We hope they will also provide some flexibility. Based on your esoteric question--because it really is different risks, depending on the assets that are held. So what we would like to see is 5 percent, not 10 percent, as the high--5, but the flexibility for this systemic council or some other regulator to determine a standard that could be used below that."
"Mr. Yingling","I would agree with your comment, that there needs to be flexibility. The other problem we have is, particularly for smaller banks, you can only keep 5 percent, and it looks like you have 95 percent off your books. But for accounting and other reasons, you still treat it as though you have 100 percent. So that's the other issue."
"Mr. Himes","Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Talbott","Yes, H.R. 1728, which was, I think, approved by the House, started with 5 percent as the ceiling, and we think that's the right place to start. And I agree with the comments. Start with 5 percent, and then adjust the risk based on the riskiness of the underlying asset."
"Mr. Himes","I am sensing a general assent that maybe one of the guiding principles to retention ought to be the riskiness of the structured product itself. Is that maybe a place to start? Okay. I'm seeing lots of nods."
"Mr. Talbott","Yes."
"Mr. Himes","Okay. One other esoteric question. Embedded finance companies--I happen to have GE and Pitney Bowes in my district. And, of course, there are other companies that have finance arms that have operated for a long time. Certainly, the way I think about this project we're embarked on is that we look very hard at those entities that screwed up and contributed to the mess. We look a little less hard, but we look nonetheless at entities that maybe weren't involved, but could--hedge funds, others. It does seem to me that these embedded companies really weren't part of the problem. And I am glad to see that, versus the original draft, we're not requiring separation. But I am concerned about some of the restrictions, cross marketing, that are in this draft. So, again, I just would like a general comment on whether you think this threads that needle in a competent way. Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Talbott","Yes, we're pleased that the--it's grandfathered, but the provisions that you mentioned, like the cross marketing, as well as changing ownership, those essentially freeze them in time, and prevent the ILC from changing as the markets change. You risk, if you make a change, that the ILC goes away. And so you lose that flexibility, going forward, to be able to adapt as the markets change."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you. Yes, sir?"
"Mr. Wallison","If I can just make a comment on this, the legislation assumes that it is possible to separate finance and commerce. I don't think they can be separated. This has been shown again and again when the Federal Reserve has been required to decide what is a financial activity and what is not a financial activity. Here, what we are proposing is to take financial activities, whatever they are--and that's going to be a very heavily debated question right here in this committee and in the halls of Congress, generally--separate them from the operations of the company, and then impose restrictions on what that separate financial company can do to help the original parent. That is a very troubling thing to do."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","Time has expired, but I am going to ask for 10 seconds just to say to Mr. Yingling--and you have mentioned this before--I am sympathetic here. You have talked about the accounting impact. We would be glad to receive from you language that would allow securitization that would not have those broader accounting implications. We are not trying to interfere with accounting, but where we're creating something, we have a right to create it clean. So, you're right, that should not--that's a serious impediment, and please give us language. We will try to clean that up."
"Mr. Yingling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. D'Arista, before you raised the question of proprietary trading and the chairman followed up with it, I had asked the previous panel about that."
"Ms. D'Arista","I heard you, sir. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. In part, because while Chairman Volcker had testified last month that proprietary trading by systemically significant firms should be prohibited, that perhaps customer trading should be allowed, but not proprietary trading. And Ms. Bair seemed to agree, with respect to the depository institutions, but thought it would be okay in an affiliate within a holding company. And then Mr. Dugan, not surprisingly, found a reason not to do it at all, and that was that if you required it to be by a separate entity, the entity would still grow to be so large that it would be systemically significant. It certainly occurred to me that there are still reasons to do it, even if all the different entities end up being really big. One is the market discipline--to use the term that others have used today--that if you're dealing with a company that just does one thing, you focus on that, and do not assume that because they're so big they're going to be good for their debts. Who could imagine Citigroup not being good for their debts? Obviously, it could never ever happen--or Bank of America. It's impossible to manage a company. Obviously, the CEOs, and certainly the boards of directors, had no idea what the different parts of their companies were doing, the ones that got into trouble. And finally, it's impossible to regulate. Again, not surprisingly, we have had other discussions of Freddie and Fannie. Everybody seems to have agreed right along that the regulator for Freddie and Fannie was not up to the task, because Freddie and Fannie was so complex. And they had derivatives in case interest rates went up, they had derivatives in case interest rates went down. And there were only a handful of people on the planet who could figure out what it all meant. And the more lines of business there are that are all complex and opaque, the harder it is to regulate. Do you agree that even if the separate entities end up being really big, and probably systemically important, that proprietary trading should not be done at the same entity that's doing--that is a depository institution that's doing lending?"
"Ms. D'Arista","I would agree, and I would think that you need to limit proprietary trading across the entire financial system, not only within the conglomerate, but with other institutions. Typically, this was the province of investment banks in the past, who have changed muchly, as we know. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Right."
"Ms. D'Arista","I think as I began to say--and I will submit some information about my thinking on this--we could go at this in a number of ways: limiting leverage; limiting counterparty exposure; etc. This will reduce the amount of counterparty trading, or proprietary trading, that is going on. But you have to understand that the proprietary trading is what blew up, inflated into a balloon, our financial system. We are not Iceland, but we're getting there, if we don't do something about it. In other words, size is important Because of what it means in terms of gross domestic product, in the size of the financial institution itself, of the financial sector, etc. Where does it get to the point where we don't produce enough in the economy to cover the exposure of our financial sector? Mr. Miller of North Carolina. All right. Mr. Yingling, should depository institutions do proprietary trading?"
"Mr. Yingling","I don't think they should do it directly in the depository institution. I would agree with Ms. Bair's response to you earlier. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. That affiliates within the holding company should do proprietary trading, but--"
"Mr. Yingling","Yes, with careful regulation and capital requirements and leverage limits. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Mr. Ryan, you seem to want to be recognized. Were you raising your hand?"
"Mr. Ryan","I do. Thank you. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Yes."
"Mr. Ryan","That's why I came, to answer questions like this. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay."
"Mr. Ryan","And my view is, first of all, there are different types of proprietary trading. Some have excessive risk, some do not. And that's an important question. What we have proposed--and I think that your bill proposes, or the Administration's bill proposes--is this type of activity would be in the domain of the systemic risk regulator. They would look to see, are they taking excessive risk? Or, more importantly, are they capable of managing the risks that they're taking? That is the way I would approach it, because there is such a wide difference between excessive risk in proprietary trading, and some proprietary trading that is not that risky."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Missouri."
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. D'Arista, you said we're not quite Iceland, but we're getting there. Are you suggesting we're going to lose McDonald's? "
"Ms. D'Arista","No, and I perhaps exaggerated for effect."
"Mr. Cleaver","I am--that's--yes. It came through clearly. But I do have a serious--my kids would think that's serious. But I have an even more serious question. The World Bank president on Monday--Mr. Zoellick--made a speech. And it was a little surprising in the fact that he said that Treasury, rather than the Fed, should be given the authority to regulate systemic risk, because Treasury is an executive department, and that both Congress and the public would have more involvement in how this authority is used than if the Fed is given this authority. Where do you come down on that?"
"Ms. D'Arista","As President Trumka said, if the Fed were a reform, we would not have a problem with the Fed having the responsibilities that they have been given. I think we do have a problem with the Treasury. The Federal Reserve is an agency of the Congress. And I think that the Congress needs to undertake greater responsibility for overseeing the Fed, both in terms of monetary policy and regulatory policy. But the idea that the Treasury, the Administration, should assume such a large role is, in my view, a problem."
"Mr. Cleaver","So you are saying that it is de-politicized-- I'm asking the question--it is de-politicized if the Fed has the responsibility and authority, as opposed to Treasury, which is appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate?"
"Ms. D'Arista","Yes and no. I really--looking at the Constitution, and what--"
"Mr. Cleaver","We don't do that in here."
"Ms. D'Arista","Well-- "
"Mr. Cleaver","Go ahead."
"Ms. D'Arista","You have the responsibility for creating money and maintaining its value. And that is a responsibility that you passed on to the Federal Reserve. I don't think you have--I don't think this body has, in recent years, done the job it should have done with the Federal Reserve. But the Federal Reserve is an important institution, it is the central bank, and it has knowledge and reach, and it goes into the issues of external markets, etc. I think it should be on the council, but not dominate the council. I want the council to have more responsibility, but I don't feel that it should be under the thumb of the Treasury."
"Mr. Cleaver","Mr. Baker, as a former Member of this August body, do you differ with Ms. D'Arista?"
"Mr. Baker","Certainly, we feel that a council-like structure would be more appropriate in providing balance and perspective. I understand the concerns Members have with regard to the Federal Reserve unilaterally engaging. There are certain questions with regard to monetary policy obligations and resolution of particular systemically significant entities, which could create issues. Go back to Mr. Volcker during the Mexican currency crisis, when it was advocated that banks extend credit, notwithstanding concerns about creditworthiness, which created considerable concerns about the integrity of monetary policy formulation and bank lending activity. This is a very carefully constructed question that I think we should take time to examine. But certainly having a Presidential appointee unilaterally make the decision or have the Federal Reserve make the decision, both are fraught with inappropriate resolution ability."
"Mr. Cleaver","Are any of you aware of any other central bank that has the responsibility for supervising systemic banking risk and managing monetary policy? Any other central bank that does--yes, sir, Mr. Wallison?"
"Mr. Wallison","There are other central banks that do that. I think the French central bank does that."
"The Chairman","Did you say the French central bank?"
"Mr. Wallison","Yes."
"The Chairman","But I thought they lost monetary policy to the European Bank. So they don't have monetary any more, ECB does."
"Mr. Wallison","Yes, I suppose it's possible, if the ECB has taken over all the central bank responsibilities. But I think the national central banks do continue to have some responsibility for monetary policy within those countries. But I just wanted to mention that they are proposing to do this in the U.K., to return some responsibility to the Bank of England that was taken away. But it is a troubling idea, because the central bank has important responsibilities, and the idea of giving it responsibilities that would otherwise be handled by a political organ of the government, in some ways, compromises its independence. And in the United States this is very troubling, because to weaken the dollar through compromising--"
"The Chairman","Time has expired."
"Mr. Wallison","--the independence of the central bank is a problem."
"The Chairman","The time has expired."
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","I think many of the national central banks will welcome your restoring to them powers that I understand they all lament having lost. The gentleman from California is now recognized."
"Mr. Sherman","Let me ask the independent bankers, under the recapture provisions, your members could be taxed if they have assets of over $10 billion. Are you confident that every future Administration will not hit you with any significant taxes for the cost of bailing out the big folks on Wall Street?"
"Mr. Menzies","I think the answer is, what's the right number? Should it be $10 billion? Should it be $50 billion? Should it be $100 billion? I think that is an economic question and a political question, and I don't have the answer to either."
"Mr. Sherman","Do you believe any of your members are singly and by themselves systemically important? Not that--yes, obviously, community bankers, as a group, are systemically important. But would you put any of your members in that category?"
"Mr. Menzies","We do not believe we have systemically important members. And we do believe we are systemically important to every community we serve."
"Mr. Sherman","You were saying that you do not believe that any one of your members meets the statutory definition of being--"
"Mr. Menzies","Of being systemically important, no."
"Mr. Sherman","So, none of your members is going to be able to benefit from an implicit Federal guarantee that says, ``You are `too-big-to-fail,' and unsecured creditors will get some sort of bail-out assistance in order to safeguard our economy from systemic risk.'' Your uninsured creditors don't get any of that, right?"
"Mr. Menzies","No. If we fail, we fail. Our uninsured creditors are not paid. It's as simple as that."
"Mr. Sherman","So do you think that the tax should be imposed on any entity that is too small to be considered ``too-big-to- fail?''"
"Mr. Menzies","Absolutely not."
"Mr. Sherman","Okay. Mr. Baker, welcome back."
"Mr. Baker","Thank you."
"Mr. Sherman","Hedge funds are often under $10 billion. But you folks--some of your members engage in pretty sophisticated--some would say risky--investment strategies. You were careful to point out that many of them don't. Do you believe that a $9 billion hedge fund with tens of billions of dollars of contingent liabilities should be subject to this tax so that we can recoup the costs of bailing out a systemically important institution?"
"Mr. Baker","I think the whole manner of who is assessed, and to what extent, for the failure of an unrelated enterprise--for example, if I am understanding the mark properly, it could be an insurance company that has activities totally unrelated to the hedge fund sector performance. The question becomes, how far does one go in extending the assessment on--financial in nature--outside the sector in which you are performing? So I--"
"Mr. Sherman","Do you think that if we bail out an insurance company, only the insurance companies should pay the tax, and if we bail out a commercial bank, only the commercial banks should pay the tax?"
"Mr. Baker","It's unclear as to the economic resolution at the scale of the--the difficulty and the assets of the particular sector. It certainly is something worth a discussion. I would say, as far as my members will go, we are not looking for bailouts. We haven't received a bailout. Now, we--"
"Mr. Sherman","Well--"
"Mr. Baker","--fortunately, because of the length of the future, and how uncertain it is, we may be subject to resolution. But the distinction between the two is pretty significant."
"Mr. Sherman","Let me interrupt and go to Mr. Swagel. Can you run a modern economy if the major players do not believe that the major players are likely to be bailed out, should it come to that? Can we run this country without bailouts being available when Treasury thinks they ought to be?"
"Mr. Swagel","Right. If the major players think that there is a possibility of a bailout, that will affect their behavior. If, for some reason, as you--"
"Mr. Sherman","So--oh, yes. Obviously, if you go out and tell everybody, as we apparently--unbeknownst to me--did, prior to Lehman Brothers, that everybody like Lehman Brothers is going to get bailed out, and then you don't do it, then you're building the house of cards and then you're not protecting those cards from the wind. But my question is, can you--"
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired."
"Mr. Swagel","I would just briefly note that Lehman's senior debt was trading at 10 cents on the dollar before it failed, and the auction cleared at 9 cents on the dollar. So people had a pretty good sense of what was going to happen to Lehman."
"The Chairman","The hearing is now adjourned. I thank the witnesses for their persistence in staying through a couple of votes. And let me say anyone who wants to--we have asked specifically of Ms. D'Arista--but anybody who has any further information to send in, we will be glad to get it.   "
