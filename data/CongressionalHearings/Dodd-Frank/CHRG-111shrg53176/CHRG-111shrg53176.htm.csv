"Chairman Dodd","Good morning. The Committee will come to order. Let me welcome my colleagues who are here, as well as our witnesses. We have a very busy morning today. We have got a long list of very distinguished witnesses to appear before us this morning on the subject matter of enhancing investor protection and the regulation of securities markets. This is the ninth--is it the ninth or tenth?--on the general matter of the modernization of Federal regulations and the second very specific hearing on the securities industry itself. There is an awful lot of ground to cover here. We have three panels this morning, the first, of course, involving Mary Schapiro, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and Fred Joseph, who is the President of North American Securities Administrators Association. A second panel of witnesses who have been before this Committee on numerous occasions, of course, the previous Chairs--I see Mr. Breeden is here already this morning, and Arthur Levitt and others, along with Paul Atkins, who will be testifying about their experience, background, how this all emerged, and their thoughts on how we move forward. And then a third panel of witnesses who will give us some very current experiences they are going through and ideas and thoughts as to how we ought to proceed. So I appreciate their testimony. What I am going to do is have opening statements by just Senator Shelby and myself, although Senator Warner is here, and as long as no one else shows up, you can make an opening statement, because I worry about if we have everybody show up, we will be here until midnight tonight.","Speech",""
"Senator Shelby","Governor Warner--he is used to those opening statements.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, I know. Well, he was a good Governor and he is a good Senator. We welcome him to this Committee. Then I am going to ask my colleagues--we are going to have one round on the first panel. As much as there are many questions, obviously, we have for both of you, but if we end up with too many rounds, we will never get to the second and third panels, and colleagues have busy schedules as well, as do our witnesses. So we will cut it off after one round. Then we will go to the second panel, which I will leave a little more open, given the backgrounds of our witnesses, and the third panel. With that, let me share some opening comments and then turn to Senator Shelby, and then we will go right to our witnesses this morning. Today, the Committee meets, as I said, for our second hearing to examine the securities market regulation, the ninth hearing on this general matter of modernization of Federal regulations. This hearing is to discuss how investors and our entire financial system are protected, or lack of protection, in the future from the kind of activities that led to the current crisis. This hearing is one of a series, as I mentioned, of nine we have already convened to modernize the overall regulatory framework and to rebuild our financial system. And I saw this morning the headlines of our local newspaper here, the direction that the Secretary of the Treasury is heading. I welcome that. This is all within about 60 days of this administration coming to office. We will not have all the time this morning to go over that. This Committee will be meeting at the request of the Treasury tomorrow with Democrats and Republicans to listen to some of these thoughts. It is not a formal hearing. We will have one of those. But given the time constraints and the fact that the administration is heading overseas to the meeting coming up with the G-20, we thought it would be worthwhile to have at least a briefing as to where this thing is heading. So we welcome that and are excited over the fact that they are going to be proposing some thoughts in this area as well. We are also very excited to have two witnesses who are not only former Chairmen of the SEC but also, I might add, residents of my own State as well, having Arthur Levitt and Richard Breeden with us. From the outset, I have argued that our financial system is not really in need of reform but modernization, that truly protecting consumers and investors in the decades to come will require a vast overhaul of our financial architecture that recognizes the extraordinary transformation that has occurred over the last quarter of a century, and it is extraordinary. And nowhere has that transformation been clearer than in the area of securities, which have come to dominate our financial system, now representing 80 percent--80 percent--of all financial assets in the United States. With pension funds, the proliferation of 401(k)s and the like, today half of all households in the United States are invested in some way in the securities markets. As Federal Reserve Governor Dan Tarullo said at our last hearing on this subject matter, ``The source of systemic risk in our financial system has, to some considerable extent, migrated from traditional banking activities to markets over the last 20 or 25 years.'' In essence, as the assets of our financial system have shifted from banking deposits to securities, so too have the dangers posed to our economy as a whole. We need regulators with the expertise, tools, and resources to regulate this new type of financial system. At our last hearing on this subject, this Committee heard about the need to watch for trends that could threaten the safety of our financial system. Our witnesses had different views on what regulatory body should perform that function. Some felt it should be given to a special commission made up of the heads of existing agencies. Others have argued for a new agency or to give that authority to an existing regulator. As I have said, given the regulatory failures we saw in the lead-up to this crisis, I have concerns, and I think many of my colleagues have also expressed, about this authority residing exclusively within one body. And I re-express those views this morning. For instance, we have seen problems with the regulated bank holding companies where they have not been well regulated at the holding company level. And while there are many aspects to our financial system, systemic risk itself has many parts as well. One is the regulation of practices and products which pose systemic risk, from subprime mortgages to credit default swaps, and that is why I remain intrigued by the idea of a council approach to address this aspect of systemic risk. And I know our previous witnesses Paul Stevens with the Investment Company Institute and Damon Silvers with the AFL-CIO have both recommended this type of concept. Of course, systemic risk is only one issue which we are examining. At our last hearing on this subject matter, we heard how we could increase transparency by addressing the risks posed by derivatives. We heard ways to improve the performance of credit rating agencies, who failed the American people terribly, by requiring them to verify the information they used to make those ratings. And, more recently, Secretary of Treasury Geithner has proposed the creation of a resolution mechanism for systemically important nonbank financial institutions, and I will be very interested in hearing from you, Chairman Schapiro, on that subject matter, what your thoughts are and the role the SEC should play. In providing this authority to the FDIC, I am pleased that they have recognized the need to ensure that powerful new tools do not all reside, again, with any single agency. These are all ideas that deserve careful examination, which we will engage in here at this Committee. Today's diverse panel, including representatives from hedge funds, credit rating agencies, retail investors, industry self-regulatory organizations, paints a very vivid picture of the numerous issues facing the securities markets at this moment. The goals of modernization are clear, in my view: consistent regulation across our financial architecture with strong cops on the beat in every neighborhood; checks and balances to ensure our regulators and the institutions that oversee them are held accountable; and transparency so that consumers and investors are never in the dark about the risks they will be taking on. The time has come for a new era of responsibility in financial services. That begins with the rebuilding of our 21st century financial architecture from the bottom up, with the consumer clearly in our minds in the forefront. It begins with the work of this Committee, and, again, this is now almost the tenth hearing on the subject matter. Senator Shelby and I and our colleagues here are determined to play a constructive and positive role as we help shape this debate in the coming weeks. With that, let me turn to Senator Shelby.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today. I am particularly interested in hearing from SEC Chairman Schapiro about the steps that she is taking to address the agency's recent regulatory failures. This includes the disappearance of the investment banks, the SEC's largest regulated entities there; the systemically devastating failures by the credit rating agencies that enjoy the SEC's implicit seal of approval; and the Madoff fraud. I believe that changes in the way the agency is managed and how its resources are used will be of utmost importance in getting the SEC back on the right track. The insights of former SEC Chairmen and Commissioners, State securities regulators, and self-regulatory organizations will also be useful in determining what changes may be needed. For that reason, I am pleased that we have representatives of each of these groups here today. Only by hearing a wide range of perspectives and by digging deep inside these agencies and failed financial institutions will we be able to fully understand how we got into this crisis, how we can get out of it, and how we can prevent them in the future. Mr. Chairman, I think we are on the right road here breaking all this down into the various parts, and I commend you for that.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. I only see a couple of our colleagues, and I know that Senator Corker likes to give long opening statements.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","So I am going to presume we are going to pass and get right to our witnesses. All right. Senator Tester, any quick comments?","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Well, since Senator Corker is here, I want to give a long opening statement.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","I pass.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, again, Chairman Schapiro and Mr. Joseph, we thank you for coming before the Committee, and let me just say to my colleagues and witnesses--I always say this, but it needs to be said--that any supporting documents and information you think would be helpful in expanding your answers to questions or comments or full opening statements my colleagues would like to make will be included in the record as we go forward. And we will leave the record open for several days because invariably there will be additional questions I think my colleagues would like to ask, and we will leave that record open and ask you to respond as quickly as possible. With that, Chairman Schapiro, we welcome you before the Committee again.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. I appreciate the opportunity to testify as we face a critical juncture in the history of our Nation's financial markets. It is a particular pleasure to appear with Fred Joseph, Securities Commissioner from the State of Colorado and the head of NASAA. I am testifying today on behalf of the Commission as a whole. The Commission agrees that our goal is to improve the financial regulatory system, that we will work constructively to that end, and that we are all fully committed to the mission of the SEC. In light of the recent economic events and their impact on the American people, I believe this Committee's focus on investor protection and securities regulation as part of a reconsideration of the financial regulatory regime is timely and critically important. I strongly support the view that there is a need for systemwide consideration of risks to the financial system and for the creation of mechanisms to reduce and avert systemic risks. I am equally convinced that regulatory reform must be accomplished without compromising the integrity of our capital markets or the protection of investors. This is the SEC's core mission, and we believe that an independent agency with this singular focus is an essential element of an effective financial regulatory regime. I believe that three general principles should feature prominently in regulatory reform. The first is that an integrated capital markets regulator that focuses on investor protection is indispensable to restoring investor trust and confidence, which is in turn indispensable to the recovery of our economy; second, that regulator must be independent; and third, a strong and investor-focused capital markets regulator complements the role of a systemic risk regulator, resulting in a more effective oversight regime. The SEC's regulation of the Nation's capital markets involves an integrated set of functions that promote the efficiency, competition, and fairness of our markets for the benefit of investors; through the regulation of the exchanges, clearing agencies, and transfer agents that provide the infrastructure that makes our markets work at lightning speed, with remarkable efficiency, and at low cost to investors; through the provision of accurate, meaningful, and timely corporate information which allows investors to allocate capital efficiently; through the independence of expert accounting standard setters to ensure that the primary focus in standard setting is investors reading financials, not the companies preparing them; through the rules that ensure that mutual and money market funds which hold over $9 trillion of assets are operated for the benefit of investors and only investors; through the oversight of 5,500 broker-dealers and over 11,000 investment advisers to whom investors turn for guidance when accessing our capital markets; and, finally, through enforcement, done aggressively and without fear or favor. Each of the SEC's core functions interacts with the others. As an aggregated set, they provide for strong capital markets oversight. Take any function away, and the investor protection mission suffers. If the functions are disaggregated, capital markets oversight becomes diluted and investors suffer. As we look to the future of securities regulation, we believe that independence is an essential attribute of a capital market's regulator. Congress created the SEC to be the investor's advocate, and Congress did so precisely so that we can champion those who otherwise would not have a champion and, when necessary, take on the most powerful interests in the country. Regulatory reform must guarantee that independence in the future. Finally, the SEC, as a strong and independent capital markets regulator, will work cooperatively to support the mission of systemic risk regulation, whether it is accomplished through the designation of a single entity to monitor and control risk or through a college of regulators approach. When I returned to the SEC as Chairman in January, I appreciated the need to act swiftly to help restore investor confidence in our markets and in the SEC. In less than 2 months, we have instituted important reforms to reinvigorate our enforcement program, better train our examination staff, and improve our handling of tips and complaints. To address short selling, the Commission will consider proposals early next month to reinstate the uptick rule. And on April 15th, the Commission will hold a public roundtable on possible credit rating agency reforms. This spring, I will ask the Commission to consider proposals to strengthen money market funds through improvements to credit quality, maturity, and liquidity standards; improve investor access to public company proxies; and significantly enhance controls over the safekeeping of investor assets. But we cannot do everything alone, and this crisis highlights several pressing needs. I expect to ask for the Committee's help with legislation that would require registration of investment advisers who advise hedge funds, and likely of the hedge funds themselves; legislation to break down statutory barriers between broker-dealers and investment advisers, and to fill other gaps in regulatory oversight, including those related to credit default swaps and municipal securities, an area that has far too long needed more robust oversight. Every day when I go to work, I am committed to putting the SEC on track to serve as a forceful regulator for the benefit of America's investors. Today, the SEC's core mission of capital markets oversight and investor protection is as fundamentally important as it ever was, and I am fully committed to ensuring that the SEC carries out that job in the most effective way it can. Thank you again for the opportunity to share the SEC's views. We very much look forward to working with the Committee on any financial reform efforts in the months ahead, and I, of course, would be pleased to answer any questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MARY L. SCHAPIRO, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Chairman Schapiro. Mr. Joseph, thank you very much for being with us.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am Fred Joseph, Colorado Securities Commissioner and President of the North American Securities Administrators Association--NASAA. I am honored to be here today to discuss legislative and regulatory changes that are most relevant to Main Street Americans who are looking to regulators and lawmakers to help them rebuild and safeguard their financial security. In November 2008, NASAA released its Core Principles for Regulatory Reform in Financial Services and subsequently issued a pro-investor legislative agenda for the 111th Congress. Today I would like to highlight the recommendations that we feel are most vital to sound regulatory reform and strong investor protection. NASAA's top legislative priority is to protect investors by preserving State securities regulatory and enforcement authority over those who offer investment advice and sell securities to their residents. Just one look at our enforcement data shows the effectiveness of State securities regulation. Last year in Colorado alone, my office conducted investigations that led to 246 enforcement actions, resulting in $3 million ordered to be returned to investors and 434 years of prison time for fraudsters. And just last month, a Ponzi scheme investigation launched by my office resulted in a prison sentence of 132 years for the main perpetrator. And yet, over a number of years there have been calls for preemption of State regulation and enforcement. The National Securities Markets Improvement Act of 1996, NSMIA, preempted much of the States' regulatory authority for securities traded in national markets. Although it left State antifraud enforcement largely intact, it limited the States' ability to address fraud in its earliest stages before massive losses have been inflicted on investors. An example of this is in the area of private offerings under Rule 506 of Regulation D. These offerings enjoy an exemption from registration under Federal securities law, so they receive virtually no regulatory scrutiny. As a result, we have observed a significant rise in the number of offerings made pursuant to Rule 506 that are later discovered to be fraudulent. Although Congress preserved the States' authority to take enforcement actions for fraud, this power is no substitute for a State's ability to scrutinize the offerings for signs of potential abuse and to ensure that disclosure is adequate before harm is done to investors. NASAA believes the time has come for Congress to reinstate State regulatory oversight of all Rule 506 offerings. Next, the Madoff case illustrates the horrific consequences we face when an investment adviser's illegal activity goes undetected and unchecked for an extended period. NASAA recommends two changes to enhance the States' role in policing investment advisers. First, the SEC should expand the class of IAs that are subject to State registration and oversight. In NSMIA, Congress provided that the States would regulate IAs with up to $25 million in assets under management, while the SEC would regulate the larger IAs. Congress further intended that the SEC would periodically review this allocation of authority and adjust it appropriately. The time is now for the $25 million ``assets under management'' test to be increased possibly to $100 million. Congress should also consider enhancing the States' enforcement authority over large IAs. Currently, a State can only take enforcement action against a federally registered investment adviser if it finds evidence of fraud. This authority should be broadened to encompass any violations under State law, including dishonest and unethical practices. This enhancement will not interfere with the SEC's exclusive authority to register and oversee the activities of large IAs. NASAA also urges Congress to apply the fiduciary duty to all financial professionals who give investment advice regarding securities--broker-dealers and investment advisers alike. This step will enhance investor protection, eliminate confusion, and even promote regulatory fairness by establishing conduct standards according to the nature of the services provided and not the licensing status of the provider. The fiduciary duty is the obligation to place a client's interest first, to eliminate any conflicts of interest, and to make full and fair disclosure to clients. We recommend that Congress ratify the highest standard of care. For all financial professionals, the interests of the clients must come first at all times. Many observers believe that private actions are the principal means of redress for victims of securities fraud, but they also play an indispensable role in deterring fraud and complementing the enforcement efforts of Government regulators and prosecutors. The problem is that Congress and the U.S. Supreme Court have restricted the ability of private plaintiffs to seek redress in court for securities fraud. These restrictions have not only reduced the compensation available to those who have been the victims of securities fraud, but they have also weakened a powerful deterrent against misconduct in our financial markets. Removing excessive restrictions on access to the courts would not only provide just compensation for investors, it would also benefit regulators by restoring a powerful deterrent against fraud and abuse--that is, the threat of civil liability. In conclusion, State securities regulators believe that enhancing our securities laws and regulations and ensuring they are being vigorously enforced is the key to restoring investor confidence in our markets. NASAA and its members are committed to working with the Committee to ensure that the Nation's financial services regulatory regime undergoes the important changes that are necessary to enhance Main Street investor protection, which State securities regulators have provided for nearly 100 years. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF FRED J. JOSEPH, PRESIDENT, NORTH AMERICAN SECURITIES ADMINISTRATORS ASSOCIATION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Joseph. We appreciate that very much. We will begin with the first round, and I will ask the clerk to keep an eye on this clock here so we make sure we get to everybody and move along with as many witnesses we have. Madam Chairman, thank you again for being with us here this morning. Lehman Brothers, Financial Products Division, AIG, among others, I guess, you have heard Secretary Geithner and Fed Chairman Bernanke propose the creation of a resolution mechanism for nonbank entities as a way to move things forward. Obviously, you are talking about an area in which the SEC plays a very critical role. So, one, I would be interested to know whether or not you were consulted on this at all. We have talked about the Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, but given the fact we are talking about entities that would normally fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC or the State regulators, were you at all consulted by the Treasury and the Fed? What role do you think the SEC should play in this resolution mechanism given the oversight and regulator responsibilities? And let me take advantage of the moment as well to ask you, if you would, to comment on the reports of the regulatory changes that Secretary Geithner has mentioned this morning. In fact, I will ask both of you to do that, but let me begin with Chairman Schapiro.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would say broadly and quite generally there was consultation with respect to the concept of filling the gaps in the existing resolution regime, but really very little conversation about what that would look like and what the legislative proposal ultimately would propose. We clearly have gaps in our resolution regime for large financial institutions. SIPC obviously handles the unwinding and the liquidation of a broker-dealer. FDIC is empowered to handle the unwinding or the resolution of a bank, but we have bank holding companies and other large financial institutions for which there really is no organized resolution regime. And I do think that that was an issue, clearly an issue with AIG, but also an issue with Lehman Brothers and other institutions. So I fully support the concept of closing the gap in resolution regimes so that we have a more coherent approach. Whether that ultimately rolls SIPC, over which the SEC has authority, into it or it works to be highly coordinated and cooperative with an entity like SIPC I think is something we should probably discuss as this legislation moves forward.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just say on that point, before we move to the second question, whether they have consulted with you or not, I would hope that you would demand to be consulted on this. This is something where clearly this is--you are going to have a resolution of these entities here, given the role of the SEC in the regulation of them and the oversight of them. And I am very much supportive of the idea of having a resolution mechanism. I do not want to suggest I am not. But it seems to me you have got to be involved in this.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","There is actually no question but that we have to be involved in this. The SEC has an enormously important role to play here as the expert. But, again, as I said in my opening statement, as the advocate for the investor whose funds are in potentially multiple components of a large financial firm, and most particularly, of course, the broker- dealer, and our concern will always be the protection of investors' assets in the broker-dealers. So I am not known for being shy. I have no intention of being shy.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Kick down the door, if you have to.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I will kick down the door.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Joseph--let me have you respond to this quickly, and then I want to get back to this--and do not take a long time on the second part of that question, but I would be interested in your general reaction to what you have heard this morning from Treasury and others on the modernization.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","With respect to a systemic risk regulator?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Again, the devil is in the details on this one for sure, and my concern is that in the creation of a systemic risk regulator we do not create a monolithic entity that supplants the important functions that are served by multiple other agencies and most especially, in my view, the Securities and Exchange Commission and our role as a regulator of the capital markets with a focus, again, solely on investors and investor protection. So while I support the concept of either a systemic regulator or a college of regulators--which I think is a concept you have talked about; I know there is at least one bill proposed that would create that sort of a mechanism, and I think it is well worth exploring because I think multiple regulators bring a lot to the table and multiple perspectives. Nonetheless, whichever way we end up going, I think there is value to a view across the markets of large or rapidly increasing exposures that can threaten the health of the financial system. I think there is an important focus on evaluation of risk management procedures within large firms. I think there are certain prudential standards that ought to be established for very important systemic institutions. And I think a risk regulator can help the appropriate resolution authority in their functions. But I think what is really important is that while we try to create a mechanism like this, that we do not try to supplant the very important functions that are engaged in by agencies like the SEC in the regulation of markets, clearance and settlement systems, brokerage firms, mutual funds where Americans entrust their savings and so forth.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just say, my time is up here, and, again, I think Senator Shelby and I are both very determined to work very closely together on this, so I would not want any of my statements to be taken as a final conclusion on this. But as we talk about a systemic risk regulator and a prudential regulator, my own view is we put that together. I get somewhat uneasy about consolidation of a lot of this. It looks great on a sheet of paper in terms of doing the efficiencies of it. But I for one feel very strongly, at least at this point, that the SEC and the function of the SEC ought not to be so incorporated in something that it ends up diminishing the role of the Securities and Exchange Commission in investor confidence, investor confidence, investor confidence.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I completely agree with you. My fear is that a systemic risk regulator and systemic risk concerns will always trump investor protection. And given the structure of our markets and the broad participation of the public in our markets, that would be a terrible result.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","We are interested in your thoughts and views on this as well, but I would not want the moment to pass without expressing my reservations about moving a lot of boxes around and consolidating things and assuming you are getting something better because you have got fewer boxes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","In fact, the goal is that consumer, that investor, that shareholder, that user of the system, what is in their interest? You begin there.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Picking up on the area that Senator Dodd was in, Chairman Schapiro, the SEC's Consolidated Supervised Entity Program, I believe was not a success. What role, if any, should the SEC-- you are the Chairwoman of the SEC--play in prudential supervision?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think it is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Can you bring the microphone up closer, please?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Sure. I am sorry. Is that better?","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think the SEC's Consolidated Supervised Entity Program was not a success. I think that is a fair evaluation. It has been replaced now because we obviously still have very important oversight of brokerage firms that have financial and operational issues that need the close supervision of the SEC, and it has been replaced by an Office of Broker-Dealer Risk Management. Nonetheless, our focus on the broker-dealer is very important and it is well ingrained in the SEC. But you can't effectively oversee the broker-dealer and its operations if you don't also have the ability to understand what is going on in a holding company or an affiliate, including overseas affiliates, whose activities can very, very directly impact the broker- dealer and the safekeeping of customer assets at that broker- dealer. So my view is that we have responsibility for brokerage firms, but we also have to have what we call a touch at the holding company level and at the affiliate level to understand risk management, exposures, leverage, and other issues that have implications for the broker-dealer's health.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","You have announced plans to consider reinstating the uptick rule, or a variation of the rule, at an open meeting next month. A lot of economic analysis was done before the rule was eliminated in 2007. How are you incorporating economic analysis into the decision about whether, and if so, how to reinstate an uptick rule?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, you are absolutely right. We are going to consider at an April 8 Commission meeting proposing to reinstate the uptick rule, or a bid test, or a circuit breaker, or some combination of those as a mechanism for controlling short selling to some extent. We are obviously acutely aware of the tremendous interest in this issue on both sides. Economic analysis did play a very important role in the elimination of the uptick test and we would expect that our economists at the SEC are looking at data now in the context of the changes in the markets to understand what the impact of an uptick rule might be, and I would expect that we will make data available, to the extent we can, to independent economists to do some analysis, as well. We will also hold in conjunction with the open meeting where we will consider the uptick test a public roundtable where we will solicit views more broadly about not just the uptick test, but other potential Governors on short selling.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","The SEC's examination function used to be integrated into each of the rulemaking divisions. Over 10 years ago, it was split off into a separate office. Some people have argued that this structure creates a dangerous wall between those who write the rules and those who monitor how firms are implementing them. Are you at the SEC reviewing this structure and how it continues to make sense, especially in light of the Madoff-Stanford financial and market timing scandals?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Yes, Senator, we are. I have only been on board about 2 months, not quite 2 months, and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I know that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","----and reviewing the structure of the agency broadly is high on my list of things to get done. It is really critically important that we have an examination staff that has the tools and the skill sets to do a more effective job, the most effective job possible, but that is also linked back to the policymaking parts of the organization so that they can inform policymaking and they can also inform the Commission about areas where we may need to take further action. So I am looking very broadly at the structure of the entire agency and, of course, OC is a component of that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","You have also noted that the SEC may ask Congress for a statutory mandate that hedge fund advisors register. Would your request also extend to venture capital and private equity advisors, and how would the influx of new advisors affect the frequency with which advisors get inspected?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Well, it is a terrific question because right now, we have something on the nature of 400 examiners to cover 11,300 advisors and more than 8,000 mutual funds. So without additional resources, we could not make, even given the authority to regulate hedge funds, we couldn't make that a reality in a very effective way.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","How much money are you going to need there? I know this is an Appropriations Committee question, but I am also on that committee.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We are working on that analysis right now and will be happy to provide it to the Committee as soon as possible.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","OK.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Also, it is important, though, that in addition to resources, we need to have the skill sets that are appropriate in order to do an effective job with hedge fund regulation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Schumer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding the hearing, and thank you to the witnesses for being here today. My first question deals with executive compensation. It has become clear that something is out of whack with executive compensation. I think we all believe that people should be rewarded for good performance. That is not the problem. But what we have seen in many instances, that has enraged Americans, is a ``heads, I win, tails, you lose'' system, in which executives are rewarded for flash-in-the-pan short-term gains, or even worse, rewarded richly when the company does poorly and the shareholders have been hammered. I think that is what most confounds people--bad performance, higher salary. Corporate boards are supposed to keep an eye on compensation. They are supposed to keep it aligned with shareholder interests. Lately, they seem to have more interest in keeping the CEOs and top management happy than in carrying out their fiduciary responsibilities, so I think we have to address that. We have learned a lot about this in the last while. Last year, when he was a Senator, President Obama sponsored an advisory say on pay proposal. I think we have to look at this. I am for it. But for say on pay to have teeth, it seems pretty clear it requires shareholders to have a stronger voice in regard to corporate management. This obviously means shareholders need to have a real voice in the election of directors. Right now, given the fact it is so hard to get access to the proxy materials for nonmanagement shareholders, this isn't true, so I was encouraged to hear in your testimony you don't believe the SEC has gone far enough in this area. First, how are you proceeding to correct this, and do you agree with me that, in conjunction, real proxy access along with say on pay would have some real impact on compensation practices and on enhanced board responsibility more generally?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, I agree with everything you have said----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Oh, well maybe we should stop right now.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I could stop right there in the interest of time. Let me say quickly, I think there has been a lot of effort to link pay to performance, but there has been a nonsuccessful effort to link pay to risk taking and that is a responsibility for boards, to understand the appetite for risk within the organization and to control it, and one way to control it is through linkage to compensation practices for senior management. We will move ahead this spring to propose greater access to the proxy for shareholders as a mechanism both to empower shareholders, who are, in fact, the owners of the corporation, but also as a mechanism to help provide greater discipline with respect to compensation and risk taking.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, and I look forward to working with you on this area. I think we need to move forward. Second is enforcement funds. We know--everyone knows about the Madoff case, but it is emblematic of a broader trend of fraud that I believe is going to be uncovered in the aftermath of this financial crisis. Back in the S&L crisis, I helped push a law that would get special prosecutors, FBI agents, and bank examiners to go after that fraud. Mr. Breeden is shaking his head because we worked together on that. And we need to do that again, particularly now. If you saw yesterday's newspaper, the administration, correctly, doesn't want to reduce antiterrorism efforts in the Justice Department, but that squeezes new needs, such as financial investigators. In conjunction with my colleagues on this Committee, we are trying to increase the SEC enforcement budget. I proposed legislation to do that with Senator Shelby, which we are going to try to do in the Appropriations Committee. Can you give us a sense of what improvements you could make with a stronger enforcement budget?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I would be happy to, and we----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Or an increased budget in general, too.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We would be grateful recipients of an increased budget and particularly an increased enforcement budget. We have a new Enforcement Director beginning on Monday. He spent 11 years as a prosecutor and head of the Securities and Commodities Fraud Task Force in the Southern District of New York. He is coming in with a renewed commitment to the SEC's focus on bringing the most important cases, the most meaningful cases, in the quickest time possible in order to protect investors more effectively. We are also looking at technology improvements to support our enforcement and examination staff. The SEC's technology is light years behind Wall Street, and frankly, light years behind everybody else.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We have enhanced our training programs. We have a number of people who are now taking the Certified Fraud Examiner Program, as well as enhancing dramatically our internal training programs. And we are actively seeking new skill sets, including in financial analysis, forensic accounting, trading, and other areas, so that we are better able to keep up with what is going on and what the fraudsters are up to.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. So I see you need the money. Could I ask one more, Mr. Chairman? Quickly, just on derivatives clearing. For a while, I have been advocating that derivatives ought to be traded whenever they can be--some are very complicated and there is no market--in either a clearinghouse, or for me, preferably, an exchange. I know that this morning, Secretary Geithner is going to mention that in his testimony, at least as I understand it, on the House side. What steps is the SEC encouraging to take to encourage the use of central counterparties? Do you have the authority to require clearing of certain types of derivatives now? If you don't, is it the kind of authority that you want, and if not, what other kinds of authority do you need?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I believe that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Do you agree with the general thrust?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Yes. CDS should be centrally cleared. We do not have the authority right now to require that. We have facilitated the approval of three central counterparties for CDS clearing that we have done jointly with the Fed and with the Commodities Futures Trading Commission and we would strongly recommend that Congress require central clearing of CDS. I am not a big believer in voluntary regulation and I think that this is an area where we need authority.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Did I hear you say in response to Senator Schumer on the way on pay that you are inclined to be supportive of that in terms of shareholder----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I do support say on pay, the advisory vote by shareholders of pay, yes.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Good. Thank you for that. And let me just say, too, as I turn to Senator Corker, there are some wonderful people who work at your organization and I wouldn't want our comments to talk about needs and resources and so forth to be reflective of how many of us feel about how hard working people are at the SEC. They need the tools, as Senator Schumer points out, the resources and so forth there, but it is not for lack of determination of good people who want to do a good job, and I think that needs to be said. It can't be said often enough.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I appreciate that very much.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you all for being here and for your testimony. I just, in looking at my BlackBerry a second, would recite a quote from Secretary Geithner this morning on the other side of the Capitol. We have a moment now where there is broad-based will to change things that people did not want to change in the past. I am getting a little feeling of nervousness just about the pace at which change is taking place. Typically, when you move in crisis, you end up with not having a cause-neutral solution, OK. I would just say to you, if you are going to be kicking the door down, the kicking is good right now. I mean, you are going to miss an opportunity if that doesn't happen very quickly, and I would just ask your opinion of some of the resolution authority concepts that were laid out in the last 24 hours. It feels to me like a codification of TARP. The very powers that the Treasury has now under TARP, it seems to me they are codifying under this proposal they have put in place, which allows them to not only take companies down, but to decide to invest in companies. I just wonder if you have any thoughts there and does that concern you in any way.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It does concern me. I think any time we write blind check legislation, as I sometimes call it, we have to be very conscious of the fact that we could set in motion a complete rewrite of the regulatory regime without perhaps truly intending to do that. So I think it is really critically important the Congress stay deeply involved in this discussion and this debate and set the parameters. So, for example, the definition of a systemically important institution is absolutely essential, and if it is very, very broadly defined, that resolution regime or the systemic risk regulator could usurp the functions of multiple other regulators, and as you know, my concern is also usurp the importance of investor protection and capital markets regulation in doing so. So I think it is really an area where Congress needs to stay involved so that we don't end up with such broad legislation that we define the regulatory regime without the input of the broadest number of perspectives and without really careful thought to what the implications are to the other functions that are important in financial regulation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I think we have seen that TARP was set up for an intended purpose and we have moved into industrial policy. The last administration did that. This administration looks like it is going to move more deeply into industrial policy. And it seems to me that what the Secretary has outlined this morning truly gives them the ability to move into any sector of our economy that they choose that they decide might be systemically putting our economy at risk, and I think we should heed Ms. Schapiro's comments here. This is a fearful time. The public is concerned, and lots of time bad things happen legislatively as a result of people being concerned. Let me ask you this. Do you agree or disagree that hedge funds, derivatives, private equity ought to be regulated?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I do not disagree. I believe they should be regulated.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And to follow up on Mr. Schumer's comment-- and obviously, how they are regulated makes a huge difference, would you not agree?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I mean, we could, in fact, I guess, run all three of those enterprises to other places if we regulate them inappropriately, is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","That is right, so we need to be sensitive to the fact that a hedge fund is not a mutual fund, and we need to understand the differences in how those investment vehicles work and tailor the regulation appropriately.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And we still want private equity to take risk, right?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I know there is not time right now. I would love to hear your thoughts on how you regulate private equity in such a way as to allow them to continue to take risks, which is what we want them to do, and yet be somewhat under their hood. So maybe you will answer that a little bit later. I want to ask you one last thing, because time is so short. We have so many panel members. Credit default swaps, I think we all understand some of the problems that have occurred. There have been people that have advocated that credit default swaps are like off-track betting if you don't have any skin in the game. And so I would love to hear your thoughts as to whether credit default swaps should only be used when you have some collateral that you are actually insuring against, or whether you ought to be able just to make bets with no collateral.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It is a terrific question and it is one where there are very strongly held views on both sides, whether there should be skin in the game in the sense that you have an insurable interest before you engage in a credit default swap. We don't have an agency perspective on that. I think it is actually an issue very much worth exploring as a mechanism to control some of the risk in the system. I can't tell you I am sophisticated enough to know all of the implications of requiring an insurable interest before engaging in a credit default swap and exactly how you would define that. But I think it is an issue that is worthy of consideration.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Well, my time is up, but my sense is that you feel like the Treasury's proposal, as outlined in the last 24 hours, could be very much a power grab, is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I certainly wouldn't use those words----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","But I am using them, and I would love to have a yes or no on that.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Nice try, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think the devil--I believe the devil is in the details. I believe it is really important we understand what it is exactly that we are proposing to do and what the implications are for the regulatory regime and for investors broadly.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. Let me just say, too, to my colleague from Tennessee, whose judgment and counsel I take very seriously, as well, this Committee will be very involved as we listen to the proposal on the resolution mechanism. I said I am generally supportive of the idea of having some sort of a resolution mechanism. What shape that takes and how it is organized and structured is something this Committee will be deeply involved in, and so----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I sure hope so. The way things have laid out, Mr. Chairman, I would rather be Treasury Secretary than chairman of the universe, so I hope we will be involved.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, be careful what you wish for.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Better than chairman of the universe? That is a high standard. Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I know my time is short, but I would like to echo what my colleague said. In the Chairman's response to the skin in the game question about credit default swaps, I know there are a number of other arguments on the other side. I would like to hear out those arguments because it does seem to me that from at least a broader-based societal standpoint, the outside risk and the downside risk that we as a society, in effect, have taken on by these nonskin in the game offside bets, we are sure seeing the downside of that. I would like to come at this, maybe look at it from the top and maybe from the bottom in one of the questions, bottom up, and you having served in the role of FINRA. I understand the need for self-regulatory organizations in light of the limited resources you have at the SEC to have the oversight on the number of institutions you have to cover, but we had a previous hearing here a month or so back on the Madoff schedule and it seemed where they were passing responsibility representatives from the SEC and FINRA about where boundaries ended and how far you could go and at what points the operator of an institution could, by simply defining that this was off-limits, could stop investigations. Have you looked through your overview, Chairman Schapiro? Have you looked at, kind of a fresh eye look at all of the SROs and what their role and function should be going forward?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We have not yet. That is something we will do, because I think it is very important. The SEC is responsible for about 30,000 regulated entities, including about 12,000 public companies. We have a staff of 3,600 people. We have got to have the ability to leverage third parties in order to do our job, which is not to say in any way that we would ever abdicate our responsibility or delegate our responsibility away. But whether it is accounting firms or SROs, the PCAOB or other entities, we need the ability to utilize them to help us get our jobs done. I think what the Madoff matter points out to me that I think is something we need to focus on, and I alluded to in my oral testimony and in more detail in the written, is that we do have doubts in the regulatory regime and a particular area of concern, and Fred Joseph raised this, as well, is the different standards of care and the different regulatory regimes that govern investment advisors and broker-dealers when they are providing largely the same service, and investors clearly don't understand that there is either a different standard of care or a different regulatory regime in place. Those are the kind of gaps that we absolutely need to fill and we need to do so from the perspective of the investor so that they are getting uniform protections and standard of care and regulatory oversight regardless of what the title is of the person who is offering them financial services, and that is an area where I think we need to be very focused.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I would love to come back and pursue that later, but I have got two other areas and my time is short. One is, following up on Senator Schumer's comments, and I was appreciative of your comments that the Chairman brought out, as well, on say on pay. But I do think that at some point, this Committee also needs to take a look at corporate governance. I believe a lot of good things may have come out of Sarbanes-Oxley. One of the challenging things that came out of Sarbanes-Oxley is I think it is even tougher to get good quality board members to serve on public companies. I would actually believe that one of the unintended consequences of Sarbanes-Oxley may be that chairmen of companies end up getting even more captured board members because so few folks, other than maybe their friends, would want to serve on a public board at this point. I have explored the option of looking at institutional investors, could we create an effective cadre of qualified potential board members so that we really could look at the issue of how we bring some real independence and broader-based oversight on corporate governance, and I just wonder if you had any kind of initial thoughts----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We would love to work with you on that. We are engaged right now in a pretty complete review of corporate governance issues at the SEC, everything from linking-- disclosure concerning pay and its linkage to risk taking, risk disclosure more generally, qualifications of board members, and access to the proxy as a way to try to facilitate more independent boards that are more responsive to shareholders, and my view is we will take all good ideas and put them into the mix and see if we can come up with a system that works better for U.S. shareholders than the one we have----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I do think we need something to make sure the board members don't get captured as quickly and often as they do. One last question. I know my time is up, but this could be perhaps an easier one. I know you are going to deal with the uptick rule, but I wonder, as well, if you are looking in terms of short selling at some type of real-time disclosure component for short sales so that the market could know on a real-time basis the position of the number of shorts.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","We are, as you point out correctly, talking about the uptick rule at an April 8 Commission meeting. We are looking at a wide range of possibilities and disclosure is certainly one of them with respect to short selling, hard borrow, just the broad panoply of possibilities in this area. The one that is most advanced is the possibility of reinstating the uptick rule at this point.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Just on that last point Senator Warner has raised, as well, I wonder if you will also look at margin requirements. The difference between exposing weakness, which short selling does and has very great value, versus speculation, which has been, I think--you know, people have talked about mark-to-market. The quickest thing you might do about mark-to-market is get this uptick rule in place, in my view, and then look at the margin requirements as Richard Breeden talked about.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Yes, it is in former Chairman Breeden's testimony.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Senator Johanns.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and let me just say to the Chairman and Ranking Member, this is another excellent hearing. If I could, I would like to focus our attention in my limited time on Mr. Madoff and his Ponzi scheme, and I will offer an observation to start out with, and I don't suggest this in a necessarily critical way, but I am very skeptical, and I think there is reason for that skepticism. I hear your need for more people, more money, more staff, the vast regulatory responsibility you have. But I look back on the Madoff case and there is, I think, a fair amount we know today. There is a fair amount we probably don't know because of the ongoing investigation that we will learn as time goes on. But you have a gentleman out there, for lack of better terminology, I will call him a whistleblower, who I think pretty effectively blew the whistle, and having been in your position as a cabinet member and having regulatory responsibilities also, I read through that information that he provided to you folks and, boy, I would liken it to dropping a grenade in the Secretary's office. I mean, it is explosive. It sets up the possibility that everybody's investment is at risk, if not literally disappearing. And I put myself in that position and I think about, boy, I would have had the Inspector General, the Department of Justice, I mean, anybody I could have reached out to and grabbed onto to help me deal with that issue, and yet we went along here and now today we learn that maybe a billion dollars will be recovered out of some $65 billion. Now, I am very mindful of the ongoing investigation. I don't want to interfere with that. I certainly understand that. But what I want to start to understand is what went wrong, because if we don't understand what went wrong, then we can't be very effective in designing a regulatory framework that protects the consumer. What assurance can we have as the Committee that when the next whistleblower shows up, it will be different because of some action we have taken as the U.S. Senate or as the Congress to try to deal with these issues? So help me start to understand that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I would be happy to, and let me say very clearly that I don't lay the blame for the SEC's failure to respond appropriately to the Madoff to the whistleblower's information provided to the agency at the feet of a lack of resources. As you rightly point out, a fairly complete set of information was provided over a period of years to the agency and wasn't follows up on appropriately. So in this instance--we do have resource issues. In this instance, I am not sure we can blame resource issues. The Inspector General, as you correctly point out, is investigating, and that is going to take a number of additional months. My view is I need to run this agency in the meantime and I am not really anxious to wait four or five additional months to find out what went wrong and then start to fix our problems, because as you also point out correctly, we can't fix it if we don't understand how we failed. My belief is that there are multiple things that contributed to the agency's failure to act and there are a number of things that we can do and have started to do in response. One is that we have a stovepiped approach within the Securities and Exchange Commission, where information is not freely shared across offices and among departments and divisions the way it ought to be and the way that you would hope for in an agency that was really operating efficiently. We have very disparate processes for handling the between 700,000 and a million-and-a-half tips and whistleblower complaints that come into the agency on an annual basis and we don't have all the right skill sets. So that information may well have landed with somebody who didn't understand at all what they were looking at, and because the culture isn't normally one of sharing information easily, it didn't get sent necessarily to the right place. Those are all things that we can do something about. We have engaged the Center for Enterprise Modernization to come in and review all of our processes for handling those 700,000 tips and complaints and helping us build the technology that will allow us to mine those that are most productive. We will come back to this Committee and ask for whistleblower legislation that will allow us to compensate people who bring us fully formed, well documented instances of abuse or fraud that we can then pursue from a law enforcement perspective. We are bringing in new skill sets and people with the ability to look and understand the data that they are looking at. And finally, it is the job of the leaders of the agency, myself, most especially, to try to break down the walls that exist between departments and divisions so that sharing information and viewing ourselves as engaged in a common enterprise is the way we approach our work, not as divisions competing sometimes with each other. So we have a lot to do in this area. I am fully committed to fixing every problem that we have as best as I possibly can. I have only been there 2 months. I think we have gotten a lot of things started, but it is going to take time and effort to refocus the efforts and the energies of the agency on protecting investors from exactly this kind of conduct. I will say that in the last couple of months, the Ponzi scheme TRO machine has been fired up and you will not see a week go by where we are not bringing Federal court cases against Ponzi scheme operators and trying to stop them at a much, much earlier point in time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","I appreciate the candor of the answer. I think you acknowledge there were some things here that just simply were missed. My time is up. Here is what I would ask for--because this is going to unravel over time. The investigation will continue, but at some point it will conclude. My hope is that when there is a full and complete picture and we can have an open and candid discussion about what the investigation showed, et cetera, that we do that. We owe that to the people who have lost so much. And so I hope you will work with the Chairman and the Ranking Member and the Committee Members to help us just nail this thing down in terms of what happened and why it is not going to happen in the future.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I completely agree that the Congress, as our oversight body, is entitled to understand that, and the American public is entitled as well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Great. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just say in that regard, too, Jack Reed and Senator Bunning are the Chair and Ranking Member of the subcommittee dealing with securities. And today is an abbreviated session with the Chairperson of the SEC, but I commit to my colleagues this will be an ongoing conversation both formally and informally. We will find means by which we can pursue these matters, and certainly as Chairman Schapiro knows, we have made some requests which the SEC--in fact, the Chairwoman indicated to me this morning--will be getting back to us immediately on some requests the Committee has made regarding this matter, and we welcome that very much. It is very much in line with what the Senator has requested this morning. With that, Senator Tester.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby. I appreciate the hearing. Thank you both for being here. This is a question for both Chairwoman Schapiro and Mr. Joseph. I had conversations around the State, as I am sure we all have, with constituents, regulators, and finance professionals in Montana, and there is pretty much unanimous consent that one of the biggest, if not the biggest, threat to our economy right now is a lack of confidence in the marketplace. Families fear their retirement accounts and all their investments are not as safe as they once were. What do you feel in your individual capacities is the most critical step that we can take to restore consumer/customer confidence? You will both get a chance, so go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","You know, there are so many pieces to restoring investor confidence. From the perspective of the SEC, we really have to show a single-minded commitment to putting investors first in every single thing we do. That means aggressive enforcement so that investors understand that there is a penalty and a price to pay for abusing investor trust. It means ensuring that the corporate disclosure that investors get so they can make rational decisions about how to allocate their capital, whether to buy a stock or to buy a mutual fund, is absolutely honest and transparent and readily available to them. It is ensuring that post the reserve fund ``breaking the buck'' and scaring everybody about the resilience of money market funds, that we understand those issues and that we move quickly to enhance the liquidity and quality of paper that is held in money market funds. For us, it is really doing what we do every single day, but with the single-minded focus on investors and ensuring that our efforts are urgent and aggressive. And beyond that, I think obviously the economic stabilization programs need to play out. People need to see credit flowing again. They need to have faith that the people that they are dealing with are going to be honest, and enforcement is obviously a huge component of ensuring that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","Thank you, Senator. I agree with the Chairman. Her comments are right on. And you are correct, the whole system--the entire financial system--is built on trust and confidence. And at the moment I think that is a little bit shaky. If people do not believe they are on a level playing field, and if that does not happen, obviously they are not going to invest. I agree that we need to focus on investor protection. I believe we need to be certain that the people who are licensed to sell securities are adequately prepared and qualified to do so. The securities that they are selling, for example, the Reg. D Rule 506 offerings, need more regulatory scrutiny; otherwise, in some cases it is just pure gambling. Senator Dodd also pointed out that in some cases it is speculation. Senator Dodd, I would say it is speculation at best and gambling at worst in some cases. Last, we need to enforce, and enforce strongly. And I believe the SEC and the States must continue on in that role, and we take our roles very seriously.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you. One quick comment before I get to my next question. Chairwoman Schapiro, I appreciate your consideration of the uptick rule. There is a bill that Senator Isakson, Senator Kaufman, and myself are on to reintroduce it, and I think it could help, reinstituting that rule that was taken away after 8 years. I appreciate you taking that up. I want to talk just very briefly, because I have only got a minute left, about the power of a monolithic regulatory scheme versus a patchwork scheme that we have now of regulation that, quite frankly--and I think it was your predecessor who said that there was no regulation in some of these financial instruments, and it is one of the reasons we are at this point, at least from my perspective. There seemed to be a lack of consistency with the patchwork scheme because of gaps that inherently open up. Then on the other side of the coin--and I do not want to put words in your mouth--you talked about one agency could get too powerful, and I agree with that, too. So how do we solve the problem? How do we solve the problem of gaps and people saying, well, I really do not have authority to regulate this, it is somebody else's authority, and they are saying the same thing and things fall through the cracks?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think it is critically important that we fill the gaps, first and foremost. We will have overlap, and I think that does create some tension among regulators. But as compared to gaps, that is a pretty manageable process, and sometimes the creative tension that evolves between banking and securities regulators actually results in a positive. But as we identify those areas of the financial system that have not been subject to regulation--hedge funds, credit default swaps, other kinds of pooled investment vehicles--it is important that we decide that if they are important to investor protection, if they are important to the financial system, that they be brought under the Federal regulatory umbrella with the support, obviously, in multiple areas of State regulators as well, and that those gaps basically be filled by a functional regulator. I think there is also a role for a systemic risk regulator, again, whether it is done by an individual institution that has responsibility for monitoring exposures and working on prudential regulatory standards and working with a resolution regime or with a college of regulators, there has to be heightened sensitivity to these components of the financial system that have not been regulated.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","In an ideal system, you are right. But what happens when you have a lack of resources? How anxious are you to jump on some other regulatory financial mechanism out there if you can say, well, gosh, this really is not my job anyway, and I am limited in financial resources, we will let somebody else take care of it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It is really our responsibility, and we should not be in these roles if we are not willing to come to Congress and say this is a problem, we need your help, we need legislation, we need resources.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Chairwoman, I wanted to follow up on a question that Senator Johanns had asked regarding the Madoff situation, and that is not really where I was going, but I heard your response, and it sparked the old lawyer in me. I just wanted to ask, when you said that if not resources, it was not resources that prevented the SEC from more aggressively pursuing the Madoff matter, then you went into a series of more technical issues involved in that. But if it was not resources, that goes to some other motivation. What do you attribute that to?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","What I intended to say is that I do not lay the problems with Madoff solely at the foot of a lack of resources. The information came into the agency over a period of years. It is not clear to me yet--and we have, obviously, an Inspector General review ongoing right now--whether it was people who received the information did not understand the import of it and, therefore, did not pursue it, or they did not send it to the right people who could understand it and analyze the data that was contained therein. We have very disparate processes throughout the agency around the country in all of our offices for how we handle the massive amounts of data that come into the agency. Whether it fell through the cracks or somebody just did not understand what they were doing, I cannot--I do not know. I would tell----","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","So you do not know at this point. You are still undergoing an investigation. You have not reached a conclusion.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","No.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","You just do not think it was a lack of resources as such. It was more about either an understanding of it or an unwillingness to understand it or it just did not get to the right person.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It is one of those things, and my view is that we will fix all of those things, on the assumption that it is one of those things that has caused the agency not to pursue that information when it came in the door.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","The issue I really wanted to get to is the issue of systemic risk. I know there has been some commentary from the Secretary of the Treasury about this as part of this new regulatory situation, and I wondered if you could define for us how you view systemic risk. In the old days of, you know, Fannie and Freddie concerns, obviously their size was a concern, and view them by size alone as perhaps posing a systemic risk. I think that has been proven all too much to be true. And also their capital requirements were fairly thin, which I think also made them, again, a systemic risk. How do you define what is the systemic risk that we need to be looking for?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","That is probably the $64,000 question, because I think how you define it matters very much in how we ultimately structure any kind of a systemic risk regulator. Certainly, size would be a component. Relationship to other important financial institutions within our economy or----","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","Interlink between those?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Interdependency or interlinkage; the amount of leverage. I think it matters very much how we define it, because there are a lot of criteria that can go to this issue, and how we define it will define how we regulate it. And whether we have a monolithic approach, a college of regulators approach, or a functional approach with some kind of overlay of systemic risk oversight that monitors exposures, perhaps requires the reduction of leverage, requires other prudential capital or other standards to be put in place, those definitions matter greatly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","How do you think we will come to a definition? Is this something that the Secretary of the Treasury is going to define for us? Or is that part of what we----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Well, I hope the Congress will be very much engaged in coming to that definition and that the other regulatory agencies that have profound responsibilities for components of the financial regulatory system will be engaged in that process as well.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me say something. We had a witness the other day that said something that I think was very important. I think we talk about this in the singular, and I think that is sometimes where we are narrowing ourselves. He called it ``systemic risks.'' And I think that is a more appropriate wording, because there are--there are numerous risks. It could be the size of the operation, the practices and products of the--there are a lot of systemic risks that we ought to be looking at. Hence, one of the reasons why I am gravitating toward this college idea or commission idea rather than a single regulator idea, so that we have the ability to understand the risks that are posed to our system in a sense. I do not know if you agree with that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I do agree with that. I think there are many, many small risks that, accumulated, become systemically threatening, and so I think----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I did not mean to interrupt. I apologize.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","No, that is fine. I appreciate it.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","----the definition process is very, very difficult here.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","But as a result of having a regulator in place that would be strong enough to then monitor these entities that we will have defined, we will then be able, going forward, to probably have a better handle on this. How do we at this point regulate those entities that appear to be systemically risky or provide systemic risks? Is there anything we can do at the moment going forward prior to a regulatory system being redeveloped?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Well, what I think we have seen develop over the last year is a bit of a patchwork and an ad hoc approach to dealing with institutions like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns and obviously, as is playing out very much right, AIG where it is an effort on the part of multiple regulators to use whatever tools they have available to them to try to reduce the risk or resolve the issues with respect to particular institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","But is there a coordinating--I know my time is up. But is there a coordinating point, is there someone--I mean, in other words, it seems to me that with AIG, you know--is it Treasury?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It has largely evolved to be the Treasury working most closely with the Federal Reserve, in some instances with the FDIC, in some instances with the SEC.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","But that is my concern, that it is not clear to me when something like bonuses go out the door--which may, by the way, be perfectly a legal obligation that the company had. But there does not seem to be a clear understanding of who was at the end of the day providing the oversight that would have known precisely what was happening. And we are talking so many billions of dollars that it seems to me that needs to be defined before we get to a more permanent regulator.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Madam Chairlady, I appreciate your statement, particularly where you said if there ever was a time when investors needed and deserved a strong voice and a forceful advocate in the Federal Government, that time is now. And you went on to make a series of positive statements that I think are very powerful, and I appreciate that. In pursuit of those statements and in pursuit of what I asked you during your confirmation process, could you tell me what since your confirmation--and I understand it has been about 2 months or so--what steps you have taken within the Securities and Exchange Commission to increase enforcement and investor protections?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I am happy to do that. We have announced the appointment of a new enforcement Director who begins on Monday, a long-time Federal prosecutor who also ran the Commodities and Securities Task Force in the Southern District of New York. We have retained the Center for Enterprise Modernization to help us overhaul tips and complaints as they come into the agency so that we can have a better handle on and pursue those tips and complaints that are most likely to produce important investor protection enforcement cases for the agency. I ended the penalty pilot program which required that the Commission's enforcement staff pre-negotiate with the Commission before they could suggest a fine against a public company. We have speeded up dramatically the process which authorizes the staff to issue subpoenas in enforcement investigations. We have instituted new training programs. Our hiring now is focused on bringing in people with new skill sets that are in forensic accounting, financial analysis, and trading and operations. We are working on our technology. We have a long way to go there. And we have been very fortunate to have sufficient resources this year to actually do some hiring in the enforcement program, which had declined, as you may know, by about 5 or 6 percent over the last couple of years. So we have a new sense of urgency, and we have started to put into place tools that I think will really result in much more aggressive, much faster enforcement.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Well, I appreciate that you were ready for my question.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I remember the confirmation hearing.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","And I am happy to hear your answer, to be very honest with you, so I appreciate your progress there. You know, I have told some of those in the investor community that you have only been there 2 months and give it time. Some of them are worried that you will not take the tougher steps that are necessary, and particularly on proxy access. I saw that you mentioned that in your statement. I think Senator Schumer asked you a question on this, and I appreciate what you said. I just want to visit with you on that issue. Is this something that you still remain committed to offering investors, a path to nominate their own candidates for board seats on company proxy ballots? And if so, give us a sense of your timeline for addressing what is a very important investor issue.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I remain very much committed to that, and it is my expectation that--I believe we are tentatively scheduled, the Commission, to consider this issue in May--if not May, June, but certainly in the first half of this year.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Let me ask you one other question. Have you had the chance to look at the question that many in the Enforcement Division of the SEC move on to be employed by Wall Street firms? And there is some concern that there may be a conflict of interest there. Is that a revolving door, or is that something that you feel is OK?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It is a revolving door. We talked about this at my confirmation hearing, and I made a commitment to talk with the bank regulators who actually have in place some limitations on their examination staff's ability to move freely from the agency to an entity that was otherwise examined by the agency. My counterbalancing concern is that I want to attract the best and the brightest people to the SEC, and if I make it too hard for them to leave, I may not get them in the first place. So from my perspective, it is a balancing act, but it is something that I continue to be committed to looking at and hopefully will get to before terribly long.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Finally, let me ask you, in light of the recent intense pressure from financial services lobbyists on accounting standard setters over fair value accounting, what will you and the Commission do to ensure that accounting standard setters remain independent so that they can fulfill their mission of serving the needs of investors rather than the short-term interests of some of the industry?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Well, I completely agree that that is a critical function for the SEC to help protect the independence of FASB and the accounting standard setters. And I understand there is tremendous emotion and concern about fair value accounting right now and any impact that it may be having. But our guiding light on this is that investors have told us that fair value accounting is important to them. It is important to their understanding of financial statements and their confidence in the honesty of those statements, and that is critical for them to make decisions about the allocation of capital. So we will continue to be vocal proponents of the independence of FASB. I think it is one of the tremendous strengths of our corporate disclosure system, which is unsurpassed in the world, and largely as a result of having an independent, highly expert body that sets accounting standards.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","All right. Well, so far so good. Thank you, Madam Chairlady. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and, Madam Chairman, Mr. Joseph, we welcome you here and appreciate your public service and the efforts that you are doing, and yours, Mr. Joseph, is public service too, even though you are not on the Federal payroll.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","Senator, I am here for you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","We are grateful for people who serve who are not on the Federal payroll. Madam Chairman, you talked about balance, and as I listened to all of this, I think balance is a word we need to keep very much in front of us--the balance to get the good people and at the same time try to keep our eye on potential conflict of interest. In times of crisis, the impulse is always to go absolutely in the direction of protection against everything else, and the ultimate protection of investors to make sure that they do not lose any money would be to shut down the market, because as long as there is no market, nobody is going to lose anything. And, obviously, we do not want to do that because it is the power of the American market that has allowed entrepreneurs to make America not only very profitable but truly unique. I have done business around the world. I have owned businesses in other countries and done business with companies from other countries. And the American entrepreneurial spirit is indeed unique and the driving force, I think, behind our long-term prosperity. So striking the balance between regulation that will find the Bernie Madoffs and get rid of them, which the public clearly needs to do, and allowing the markets to work is, I think, philosophically your biggest challenge.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I could not agree more.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Do you want to respond to that? Have you had any late-night thoughts in a quiet room about that? Or have you been so overwhelmed with the details you have not gotten around to thinking about it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","It is a question we confront really every single day, in small issues and large. How do we keep the balance right? How do we do exactly as you say, assure the protection of investors, the integrity of the marketplace, but not regulate everything within an inch of its life so that we do not have any more innovation and we do not have any more opportunity for people with great ideas to bring them to the marketplace? I do not have any wisdom, certainly no more wisdom than you have on this. I just think it is something we have to think about as we approach every single issue. And it is one reason I like very much to have a broad and diverse group of people within the agency and on my personal staff to consult with me on issues, because they bring those different perspectives and they will tell me to slow down, not to get caught up in the moment, and think about the implications of each and every thing we are doing. And I hope we will bring that very deliberative process to all of the issues--which is not to say we will not have lots of disagreements with different constituencies, but we will always try to get the balance right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","That is my concern, one of my concerns with respect to the proposals that we have before us to restructure our whole regulatory system. Systemic risk, let us give that to the Fed; safety and soundness, let us give that to FDIC; and then transparency and business practices, let us give that to the SEC, and you will all see to it that there is no problem of any kind anywhere else. I was a new Member of this Committee right after the RTC circumstance, and there was an overreaction to the question of making sure every institution is safe and sound. I remember sitting in this room as Members of this Committee were beating up bankers about you are not making enough loans, you are not making any money available to people. And the reaction of the bankers was: Are you kidding? What we have just been through where we were beaten up for being too open in making money available to people who went out and lost it? You are darn right we are not making any loans because the regulators will kill us if we do. We are threatening safety and soundness if we make loans. You are now in an atmosphere very similar to that atmosphere where the populist reaction to things is shut everybody down, and my only concern is that if we overreact and do shut everybody down, we make the recession longer, we hurt the country, and all of the rest of it. One last quick comment. I understand before I came in you did speak about the uptick rule and looking at the locator. You and I have had these conversations. I am very grateful to you that you have now gone public with our private conversations because I still believe the issue of naked short selling is a genuine issue that too many people have said for too long does not really exist, and if it does, it does not really matter because it is really very small. And to those investors who have seen their companies destroyed as a result of it, it is a big deal. Mr. Joseph, did you want to comment on the short-selling thing? You looked expectant there, and I did not want to cut you off.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","No, I agree, Senator. Naked short selling should be curtailed, period, end of story.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Good. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Bennett. I would note before I turn to Senator Bayh, I think Senator Corker raised the issue, we have as well, that sense of balance is critical. I have been here as a Member of this Committee-- not as Chair of the Committee but as a Member of this Committee--during those periods we talk about. And there can be an exuberance of the moment, overreactions. Someone once said to me, to pick up on your point, why have we done as well as we have? Putting aside, obviously, the recent crisis we are in. We are very good. This country has been very good, very creative at creating wealth. But, second, and as importantly, it has been safe, that if you park your resources here, your hard- earned money, that the system and structure are safe. You may lose. There is no guarantee of winning. But you do not have to worry about your system. It is pretty good. We have lost that reputation. And it is striking that balance about being creative and imaginative and creating wealth and being safe. And it is not always easy to strike that perfect balance that we talk about, but that is the goal. If we lose that reputation of being a safe place to be because we have a system in place that will not allow fraud and deceit and deception to occur, and simultaneously to encourage the kind of imagination and thoughtfulness that goes into wealth creation is a challenge. Always will be a challenge. We are not going to resolve it. I think one of the things--we are raising expectations maybe here, that somehow we are going to take care of every and all problems that will ever happen again. We are not. There is someone out there right now imagining how they can circumvent this system. And the job of this Committee, this Congress, and succeeding ones will be to be vigilant as these new ideas emerge to make sure they just do not end up in the marketplace without someone putting the brakes on and saying: What are you doing with this? What does it really do? And what are the implications of it and what risk does it pose? I appreciate the Senator from Utah raising that sense of balance. It is important. Senator Corker raised it earlier, and I agree with him.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to both of you. Chairman Schapiro, I have two questions. One we discussed in my office prior to your confirmation and it relates to the importance of accurate information for investors making decisions and for markets to function, and that implicates the role of the rating agencies, which is what I would like to ask you about. With the benefit of hindsight, it appears that many of the more exotic instruments were rated too highly. The ratings were not adjusted in a timely manner. And some have raised questions about the way in which the rating agencies are compensated for making their ratings, paid by the issuers of the securities as opposed to those who purchased them or by the government itself. I would like to ask you, do you have any thoughts or can we take any additional steps to promote accurate ratings of financial instruments so that investors can make decisions in accordance with their risk tolerance and not be unpleasantly surprised by buying AAA-rated instruments that turn out to be anything but?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think accurate information is absolutely the lifeblood of our markets, and whether it is corporate disclosure or ratings, they are incredibly important to investors. The SEC over the last couple of years, since Congress gave it authority in the Credit Rating Reform Act in 2006, has done a number of things to try to bolster the regulatory regime around rating agencies. I am not sure that we have gone far enough, and on April 15, we are actually holding a roundtable to discuss further rating agency reform. We will have rating agencies there to talk about what went wrong and why. We will have large users of ratings, institutional and other investors to talk about it. And we will have people there who are going to talk about some of the more creative ideas we have heard about how to change the model of issuer pays to try to alleviate some of the conflicts of interest, and there have been some very creative ideas expressed. So we expect to have a very public day-long session talking about all of these issues, the goal of which is to inform the Commission's next steps with respect to either rulemaking or the potential to come back and ask the Committee for further legislation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","I would encourage you in this direction. I mean, a big part of what we are trying to do now is to reinstall confidence in a whole number of ways, and if people simply don't believe the information they are receiving, if they think they are buying instruments that are AAA-rated and they turn out to be anything but that, what are they to do going forward in terms of making decisions? It really undermines confidence, and so I look forward to getting the benefit of your further input on that. I would really encourage you to focus on that. Second, and my final question has to do with, in addition to accurate information making markets function efficiently, incentives are important in terms of human behavior. And I think again, with the benefit of hindsight, we can see that a lot of the incentives for people who are running publicly held companies promoted short-term decisionmaking and there was a decoupling of the potential rewards of running risks and bearing the full consequences of those risks, which does lead to skewed decisionmaking, let us just put it that way. I mean, for example, executives at some firms levered up highly. If the thing held together--and they ran significant risks--if it held together for just a year or two, they became fabulously wealthy, could take some of the chips off the table. And then if the wheels came off, well, it was the shareholders who ended up holding the bag. So, I mean, there was a decoupling. There was short-term decisionmaking as opposed to long-term decisionmaking and a decoupling of risk and the consequences of running those risks, which perverts the kind of decisions that are made. So my question to you, in terms of the incentives that exist, what can we do to promote long-term decisionmaking and real adding of value as opposed to this sort of short-term gambling mentality that took hold there for a period of time and has now come back to haunt us?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","I think there are really multiple avenues for us to pursue in that regard. One is much better disclosure about how risk is tied to compensation. We talked a lot about compensation for performance, but noticeably absent has been a real discussion about how compensation has been tied to risk taking and the implications of that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Well, if I could just interject, I mean, it is tied in some cases to short-term performance, which then comes back to haunt us----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","----because short-term can fluctuate up and down.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Exactly right, and risk taking reveals itself over the longer run, and so the compensation decisions need to be tied to that longer-run perspective. I think, also, we need better disclosure of risk of holding certain financial instruments and just generally better risk disclosure for investors. And finally, and the piece we talked about a bit is the ability of shareholders to influence more directly who serves on corporate boards and tying the responsibility of boards. Board compensation clearly resides there, but making boards explain how they closed the circle with risk taking and compensation. But giving investors greater access to determining who sits on corporate boards is an important component of that, as well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Madam Chairman. Mr. Joseph, I hope you don't feel slighted that my time has run out, but I thank you for being here, as well. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Bayh, thank you very, very much, and let me thank both of you. Mr. Joseph, let me just tell you, we have got a series of questions to submit to you, because obviously what--and some of your proposals raise issues, as well, regarding resources and tools. There is a valuable role to be played by the States. In fact, as you point out in your opening statement, because you are as close to the investor community as you are at that level, it provides an avenue for people to be able to express themselves and bring matters to the public attention. So we see a real value in what you do. I think we all have some questions about various proposals and raising from 25 to 100 million and so forth, what that involves. Obviously, the compatibility, as well, between the SEC and the States are very important. I regret we didn't get to spend more time with you, but obviously having a Chairperson here obviously focused a lot of attention on these current issues before us. So we will submit some questions to you and look forward to having you back before the Committee, as well.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Joseph","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","And Madam Chair, we thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","As you have heard, we have got a lot of interest in the subject matter, so we will have you back up formally and informally, as well.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me quickly invite our next panel, and they have been very patient and had the benefit of sitting and listening to all of this, as well, so they may want to add some addendums to their own testimony. But I am very honored and pleased to present three witnesses who are very familiar with this Committee, have been before us, some of us here on the Committee over the years. Richard Breeden served as Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission between 1989 and 1993. In July of 2002, Mr. Breeden was appointed to act as the corporate monitor of WorldCom on behalf of the U.S. District Court overseeing the case involving history's largest corporate fraud and largest bankruptcy. Arthur Levitt, Junior, is the 25th and longest serving Chairman of the SEC, from 1993 to 2001. As Chairman, he created the Office of Investor Education and Assistance, established a Web site which allowed the public free and easy access to corporate filings and investor education materials. Both Chairmen assisted our work, by the way, in Sarbanes- Oxley, going back, and I know both these individuals very, very well. If you needed to have examples, if you wanted to just say, give me an example of good public servants, I offer up the names of Arthur Levitt and Richard Breeden and a look at their work would define, I think, what has been remarkable public service, and successful in the private world, as well. So you bring a wonderful wealth of experience from both sides of the equation. You heard Senator Bennett use the word ``balance'' and others talk about how we strike those balances of wealth creation and having safe and sound financial institutions and a regulatory process. Paul Atkins is the former Commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission. He served from 2002 to 2008, and we thank you very much, as well, for joining us and we thank you for your service on the Commission during those years. I guess we begin on a seniority basis here. By seniority, I guess you were the earliest serving, Mr. Breeden, so unless you have worked out something else, we will begin with you and then move right down the line. Thank you all very much, and thank you for your patience in listening to the first panel.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, for the opportunity to offer my views on enhancing investor protection and improving financial regulation. These are really, really critical subjects and it is a great pleasure to have a chance to be back before this important Committee. I was privileged to serve as SEC Chairman from 1989 to 1993. My views here today reflect that experience at the SEC as well as my White House service in 1989, when we had to craft legislation to deal with an earlier banking crisis, that involving the savings and loans. In subsequent years, my firm has worked on the restructuring of many, many companies that encountered financial difficulties, most notably WorldCom in the 2002 to 2005 range. Today, I am an investor and my fund manages approximately $1.5 billion in equity investments in the United States and Europe on behalf of some of the Nation's largest pension plans. By any conceivable yardstick, our Nation's financial regulatory programs have not worked adequately to protect our economy, our investors, or our taxpayers. In little more than a year, U.S. equities have lost more than $7 trillion in value. Investors in financial firms that either failed or needed a government rescue have alone lost about $1 trillion in equity. These are colossal losses without any precedent since the Great Depression. After the greatest investor losses in history, I believe passionately that we need to refocus and rededicate ourselves to putting investor interests at the top of the public policy priority list. We have badly shattered investor confidence at a time when we have never needed private savings and capital formation more. There is much work to be done to restore trust, and I must say, in the public policy debates, we seem to worry endlessly about the banks that created this mess and I believe we need to focus a little more on the investors who are key for the future to get us out of it. Many people today are pointing at gaps in the regulatory structure, including systemic regulatory authority. But the Fed has always worried about systemic risk. I remember back in the Bush task force back in 1982 to 1985, the Fed talking about its role as the lender of last resort and that it worried about systemic risk. And they have been doing that and we still had a global banking crisis. The problems like the housing bubble, the massive leverage in the banks, the shaky lending practices and subprime mortgages, those things weren't hidden. They were in plain sight, except for the swaps market, where I agree with the previous witnesses that there is a need for extending oversight and jurisdiction. But for the most part, the banking and securities regulators did have tools to address many of the abusive practices but often didn't use their powers forcefully enough. Creating a systemic or super-regulator, in my view, is a giant camel's nose under the tent. It is a big, big step toward industrial planning, toward central planning of the economy, and I think the very first thing that creating a systemic regulator will do is to create systemic risk. I fear very much that if you are not extremely helpful, we will have more ``too big to fail,'' more moral hazard, and more bailouts, and that is not a healthy path for us to move forward. I am very concerned that we not shift the burden of running regulated businesses in a sound and healthy manner from management and the boards of directors that are supposed to do that. Unfortunately, in the wake of this crisis, we have seen boards of directors that failed miserably to control risk taking, excessive leverage, compensation without correlation to performance, misleading accounting and disclosure, overstated asset values, failure to perform due diligence before giant acquisitions. These and other factors are things that boards are supposed to control. But over and over again in the big failures, the boards at AIG, Fannie Mae, Lehman Brothers, CitiGroup, Bank of America, Wachovia, WAMU, in those cases, boards were not doing an adequate job. So my view is that we need to step back as part of this process and look and say, why are boards not doing what we need them to do? I think one of the important answers is that we have too much entrenchment of board members, too many staggered boards, too many super voting shares, too many self- perpetuating nominating committees, and a very, very high cost to run a proxy contest to try and replace directors who are not doing their jobs. So I think one of the important things that Congress can look at, and I hope you will look at in the future, is to enact a shareholder voting rights and proxy access act that would deal with proxy access, uninstructed votes by brokers, which is corporate ballot stuffing, majority vote for all directors every year, one share, one vote. There are a number of things where if we give a little more democracy to corporate shareholders, we can bring a little more discipline to misbehavior in corporations and not put quite so much on the idea that some super uber-regulator somewhere is going to save us from all these problems. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. BREEDEN, FORMER CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Thank you, Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby, for the opportunity to appear before the Committee this morning. Thank you for your kind words. It is good to be back with former friends and colleagues. When I last appeared before this Committee, I focused my remarks on the main causes of the crisis we are in and the significant role played by deregulation. Today, I would like to focus on the prime victim of deregulation, investors. Their confidence in fair, open, and efficient markets has been badly damaged, and not surprisingly, our markets have suffered. Above all the issues you now face, whether it is public fury over bonus payments or the excesses of companies receiving taxpayer assistance, there is none more important than investor confidence. The public may demand that you act over some momentary scandal, but you mustn't give in to bouts of populist activism. Your goal is to serve the public not by reacting to public anger, but by focusing on a system of regulation which treats all market actors the same under the law, without regard to their position or their status. Many are suggesting we should reimpose Glass-Steagall rules. For six decades, those rules kept the Nation's commercial banks away from the kinds of risky activities of investment banks. While it would be impossible to turn back the clock and reimpose Glass-Steagall, I think we can borrow from some of the principles and apply them to today's environment. The principles ensured are regulation's need to match the market action. Entities engaged in trading securities should be regulated as securities firms, while entities taking deposits and holding loans to maturity should be regulated as depository banks. Regulation, I think, is not one-size-fits-all. Accounting standards must be consistent. The mere mention of accounting can make the mind wander, but accounting is the foundation of our financial system. Under no circumstances should accounting standards be changed to suit the momentary needs of market participants. This is why mark-to-the-market accounting should not be suspended under any condition. The proper role of a securities regulator is to be the guardian of capital markets. Of course, there is an inherent tension at times between securities regulators and banking supervisors. But under no circumstances should securities regulators, especially those at the SEC, be subordinated. You must fund them appropriately, give them the legal tools they need, and hold them accountable to enforce the laws you write. And finally, all such reforms are best done in a complementary, systemic way. You can't do regulation piecemeal. Allow me to illustrate how these principles can be put to work in specific regulatory and policy reforms. First, some have suggested that you create a super-regulator. I suggest you take a diverse approach using the existing strengths of our existing regulatory agencies. For example, the Federal Reserve is a banking supervisor. It has a deep and ingrained culture that is oriented toward the safety and soundness of our banking system. Ultimately, the only solution to the tension is to live with it. when I was at the SEC, there was tension between banking regulators and securities regulators all the time. While this was frustrating for the regulators and the financial institutions themselves, I think it served the overall purposes of reducing systemic risk. Regulatory overlap is not only inevitable, I think it may be desirable. Second, mark-to-the-market or fair value standards should not be suspended. Any effort that seeks to shield investors from understanding risk profiles of individual banks would, I believe, be a mistake and contribute greatly to systemic risk. The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, the heads of the major accounting firms maintain that maintenance of mark-to-the- market standards is essential. Third, this Committee and other policymakers seek to mitigate systemic risk. I suggest promoting transparency and information discovery across multiple markets, specifically credit rating agencies, municipal bond issuers, and hedge funds. For years, credit rating agencies have been able to use legal defenses to keep the SEC from inspecting their operations even though they dispense investment advice and sit at a critical nexus of financial information and risk. In addition, these rating agencies operate with significant protections from private rights of actions. These protections need to be reconsidered. In the same manner, the SEC should have a far greater role in regulating the municipal bond market, which consists of State and local government securities. Since the New York City crisis of 1975, this market has grown to a size and complexity few anticipated. It is a ticking time bomb. The amount of corruption, the amount of abuse, the amount of pain caused to municipal workers and will be caused to municipal workers in an environment that is almost totally unregulated is a national scandal. Because of the Tower amendment, many participants, insurers, rating agencies, financial advisors, underwriters, hedge funds, money managers, and even some issuers have abused the protection granted by Congress from SEC regulation. Through multiple scandals and investment debacles hurting taxpayers, we know self-regulation by bankers and brokers through the Municipal Services Rulemaking Board simple does not work. We must level the playing field between the corporate and municipal markets, address all the risks to the financial system. In addition, I would also recommend amending the Investment Advisers Act to give the SEC the right to oversee specific areas of the hedge fund industry and other pockets of shadow markets. These steps would require over-the-counter derivatives market reform, the outcome of which would be the regulation by the SEC of all credit and securities derivatives. To make this regulation possible and efficient, it would make sense, as my predecessor, Chairman Breeden, has said so often, to combine the resources and responsibilities of the SEC and CFTC. Under no condition should the SEC lose any of its current regulatory authority. The Commission is the best friend investors have. The resulting regulatory structure would be flexible, effective in identifying potential systemic risk and supportive of financial innovations and investor choices. Most importantly, these measures would help restore investor confidence by making sure rules are enforced equally and investors are protected from fraud and outright abuse. As we have seen in the debate over mark-to-market accounting rules, there will be strong critics of a strong and consistent regulatory structure, but someone must think of the greater good. That is why this Committee must draw on its heritage of setting aside partisanship and the concerns of those with single interests and affirm the rights of investors whose confidence will determine the health of our markets, our economy, and ultimately our Nation. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ARTHUR LEVITT, FORMER CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Levitt. We thank you for being here. Mr. Atkins, we welcome you to the Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, for inviting me here today to the hearing. It is a great honor for me to be here today, and especially appearing today with two great public servants whom I know very well and admire. This Committee has had a long history of careful study and analysis of matters relating to the financial markets and the financial services industry, and as you have already heard in your hearings, there are multiple, complex, and interrelated causes to the current situation in global financial markets. I believe that these causes are more than the competence or incompetence of individuals in particular roles, but have more to do with fundamental principles of organizational behavior and incentives. Your topic for today is rather broad, so I would like to touch on a few specific items that go to the heart of an agency that I know very well, the Securities and Exchange Commission. With respect to the subject of regulatory reform----","Statement","STATEMENT OF PAUL S. ATKINS, FORMER COMMISSIONER, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Atkins, can you pull that microphone a little closer to you?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","I am sorry.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. I appreciate it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","With respect to the subject of regulatory reform, your hearings have so far been a very good start and I would suggest that you ask some very hard questions in subsequent hearings. For example, why was the SEC in the course of the last dozen years or so has the SEC experienced such catastrophic failures in basically every one of its four competencies--rulemaking, filing review, enforcement, and examinations? What led to the failures of the SEC and other regulatory agencies, both in the United States and globally, to discern the increasing risk to financial institutions under their jurisdiction? What led the failures at financial institutions to recognize the inadequacy of their own risk management systems and strategy in time to avert a collapse? How did so many investors get lulled into complacency and not adequately do their own due diligence? What is the proper role of credit rating agencies, and has regulation, in fact, fostered an oligopoly by recognizing the opinions of a few as being more privileged than those of the rest? These are hard questions, and if there are to be changes to the Federal securities laws, I think they need to be made carefully through a robust analysis of the costs and benefits of various potential actions and how those actions might affect human behavior in the market. The current situation is certainly no time to wing it or to act on gut instincts because investors ultimately pay for regulation. And if Congress doesn't get it right, severe consequences could be in store for the U.S. Once on the books, laws, especially in this area, seem to be very hard to change and unintended consequences live on. Prior to the recent crisis, the subject of regulatory balance was being discussed. Senator Schumer, Mayor Bloomberg, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and others cited many reasons why the U.S. as a marketplace was not so competitive. In fact, in 2006, the value of Rule 144A unregistered offerings in the U.S. for the first time exceeded that of public offerings. 2006 seems like a long time ago, but it still is very much a valid concern, especially once the global financial system recovers. The worrisome thing to me is that if care is not taken to have solid analysis, the wrong lessons may be gleaned from this latest crisis and that will ultimately hurt investors. It takes a long time, as I said, to change legislation in this area. So what we need is an analysis to determine how we can effectively and efficiently promote honesty and transparency in our markets and ensure that criminality is not tolerated. For example, I disagree with the assertion that deregulation in the past four, eight, ten, or what have you years has led to the current problems in the financial markets. One can hardly say that the past eight to 10 years have been deregulatory with the adoption of new laws and rules, such as Sarbanes-Oxley. More regulation for regulation's sake is not the answer What we need is smarter regulation. The global crisis has primarily affected regulated versus nonregulated entities all around the world, not just in the supposedly deregulatory United States. The question is, how did so many regulators around the world operating under vastly different regimes with differing powers and differing requirements all get it wrong? Indeed, how did so many firms with some of the best minds in the business get it wrong? During the past dozen years, the SEC has experienced catastrophic operational failures in its four core functions of filing review, rulemaking, enforcement, and examinations. ENRON's corporate filings were not reviewed for years in the 1990s. Tips were not pursued regarding Bernie Madoff and regarding the late trading of mutual funds in 2003. It took literally an Act of Congress led by this Committee to get transparency and a reformed SEC process with respect to credit rating agencies. These mistakes, I think, were a long time in the making and were caused by failures of the system of senior staff management. First, management applied faulty motivational and review criteria, and second, since resources are always limited, there is an opportunity cost in choosing to spend time and resources on one thing because then, of course, there is less time and less resources to spend on other things. With respect to opportunity costs, I believe that the SEC, especially in the years 2003 to 2005, was distracted by controversial, divisive rulemaking that lacked any grounding in cost-benefit analysis during this very crucial period right when many instruments, like CDOs and CDSs, took off and established their trajectory. Because these rules and the arguments for them were ultimately invalidated by the courts after both long litigation and much distraction for the agency and the industry, a lot of essential time was wasted. Because life is full of choices, if you devote resources to one thing, you have less to devote to another, and the one risk that you haven't focused on just may blow up in your face. That is, in fact, exactly what happened to the SEC, and it was really through back office processes and documentation that weren't attended to that led to the current crisis. There are other things that I would be happy to talk about that I put into my written testimony. With respect to that, I have mentioned in my written testimony an article on enforcement and the processes at SEC. I ask that I be able to submit that for the record.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Consider that done. That will be certainly true of both Mr. Breeden and Mr. Levitt, as well, any additional comments and thoughts. And obviously, I have already had conversations with Richard Breeden and Arthur Levitt and I expect I will have a lot more in the coming weeks, and we invite, Senator Shelby and I and Members of the Committee, as we work our way through this, and we are very conscious, both Senator Shelby and I are, of the importance of the matter and how well we handle this. So we are very interested in getting as much counsel and advice, particularly from people who have been through this and been around over the years to watch a lot of what is occurring. Let me ask you, if I can, to start out with, to get the panel's views on two proposals from the current administration, the proposal to establish a resolution authority of nonbank institutions. And I would also like to ask you to comment on the public-private plan to purchase toxic assets. You have all got tremendous experience in this area as well and a little afield. The first regarding the resolution authority, and it was the first question I raised with Chairwoman Schapiro. Arthur Levitt noted, and I quote, that regulation needs to match market action, and that if an entity is engaged in trading securities, it should be a regulated securities firm. And that is certainly almost a self-evident statement, but nonetheless, deserves being repeated. So, obviously, it begs the question, if we are going to have a resolution operation of nonbanks, to what extent, then, are we going to involve the agency or agencies that are bringing the most expertise and background to the issues so they would have some ability to manage that kind of an event? Then, second, what should the role of the securities regulator be in the orderly resolution of these securities entities. And, then, I would like you to describe, if you could, briefly, what features are necessary in the public-private plan to protect taxpayers and restore public confidence in the banking system. It seems to me--I think, like many, my general reaction to this, with all of its shortcomings, is an idea that I think they needed to pursue. Whether or not this is exactly right or not, I do not know; time will tell. But I like the thrust of it, it seems to me, because I hear the view that unless you get rid of these assets, this is going to continue to clog up the system and the credit freeze will continue. And then the only answer, seems to me, is to pour capital back in institutions, and we have just run out of patience and resources to do that. So you have to try something else to move this along. While there are questions, legitimately, about what valuation will be on these, whether or not sellers will sell, buyers will buy, it seems not trying to do something like this is a far greater mistake, in my view, than trying something. So at least my general reaction is a positive one. That does not mean I am buying into every dotted I and crossed T, but I would be very interested, given all your background and experience, to comment on that as well. So, Richard, do you want to start?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Yes, sir. Let me start with the resolution question. There is an old saying that you cannot really have Christianity without the devil, and capitalism does not work if you do not have failures. I mean, we have a competitive system, and some people win and some people lose. And if we close the door--one of the things that has traditionally been one of the greatest strengths of the U.S. economy has been Chapter 11 and our willingness to let companies fail and then restructure them. I went through the largest one in history of this country, WorldCom, where we took a company that had $35 billion a year in revenues, 75,000 employees, a mere $85 billion worth of missing assets, and all kinds of problems, a catalog longer than anybody could dream of, and over a 3-year period, we restructured it. It came out of bankruptcy with 66,000 employees still there, the business in tact. And what it was worth when it went down, probably three or 400 million, was eventually sold for 12 billion, and creditors came out with a very good recovery. If you can fix WorldCom, you can fix anything. Our problem in the financial space--so I think when you talk about nonfinancial institutions, airlines, car companies, whatever, bankruptcy is there. It is a good workable structure. And we have a problem that we seem to have policymakers who either do not understand it or are afraid to use it. And that is why we have the courts and they can restructure companies; it is a very, very good thing. In the financial world, we have been afraid to use it. And one of the thing I suggested in my testimony was that Congress think about something like the national securities surveillance courts you have created, over in the terrorism side; create a court composed of senior judges who have actually handled big, multi-billion dollar collapses and restructuring, and have expedited processes so that an AIG could--that there would be a structure to handle it. Throwing it into bureaucracies, whether it is the Treasury or the Fed, to me is the wrong approach because you are going to get ad hoc decisions. And, frankly, part of the reason we had so much panic in the market, loss of confidence, last fall was that every Sunday night you would get out of the blue a decision coming out of one of the administrative agencies about how they were handling Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers and so on. And every one of them was different. There was no consistency. One of them preferred stock to be wiped out, the next one to be protected. One of them the debt is OK; the next one, it would be wiped out. And there was no real way to predict it. And when investors cannot predict what is going to happen, then you are not going to lend credit because you cannot make a sensible decision. So I think the rule of law is a very, very healthy thing in the resolution area. And creating a court aimed at handling large financial institution failures, with lots of input from the Fed and the Treasury and SEC, but where it is done in a judicial context, would be very helpful. Mr. Chairman, we had failure of Drexel Burnham when I was at SEC, and we also had a restructuring of Solomon Brothers, two of the largest securities firms of the time. Drexel had a regulated broker-dealer and its holding company was off doing everything under the sun. When they got in trouble, we seized the broker-dealer, we sold it to PaineWebber, and we took the unregulated holding company and we sent them down to the local bankruptcy court. And they spent the next three to 4 years sorting it out, and it was just fine. The market was not interrupted in any way. The same technique could have been used at AIG. You could have taken the regulated insurance companies, sold them to other companies instead of sitting there with them, and put the unregulated activities, swaps or anything else, put them into a bankruptcy proceeding and wind them down. And that would be a much better mechanism for dealing with all the issues that come along. So I think the topic of having a resolution mechanism that works for a big financial institution is a good topic, but I would urge that we spend a little more time looking at the range of alternatives rather than just throwing them into the Treasury Department, where I am not sure they have the institutional knowledge to make good decisions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me jump--Arthur Levitt and Mr. Atkins, quickly, on this subject matter.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Generally speaking, I associate myself with Richard's views, although in this case, because of the nature of the crisis is so different than it was at the time of Drexel Burnham or elsewhere, morphing over into economic Darwinism I think is a mistake. We are operating in a polarized environment, highly polarized. And because of that, the notion of these public- private partnerships will be met with a measure of skepticism in terms of what the government may extract once more from any private sector entity that wants to deal with the bureaucracy. I agree that the approach has to be more comprehensive, less at the edges, more directly, in terms of determining who is going to make it and who is not going to make it. And the notion of adding bureaucratic layers of control and judgment and dispensation I think will slow the process and slow the eventual outcome.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just ask you--because, Richard, you were one of the architects of the Resolution Trust Corporation in the 1980s. And there, there was--being a bit of a devil's advocate. Certainly your approach is interesting, but there, there was the creation and it did work. We did not get everything back, but we got a lot back, and your idea had great value and merit. Given Arthur's point here, this is arguably a time when the tentacles are far more far reaching in many ways. The issues are not sort of stovepiped, not that they were then either, but nonetheless. Is that a change of view? If you had to go back to the 1980s, would you be sitting here offering something different than what you suggested at the time?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have thought a lot about our experiences, creating the RTC and dealing with the savings and loan crisis as I have watched the current crisis unfold. In a nutshell, our philosophy back then was no bailouts but fast funerals, and it worked pretty darn well.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","That is an Irish expression.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","It worked pretty darn well. There is similarity in the public-private partnership, that the Treasury is trying to establish for the troubled assets, and the RTC. RTC was an entity that just stripped all the assets out of everything that failed and then repackaged them and tried to sell them back out to the market as quickly as you possibly can. These assets do not get better when they are owned by the government; get them back in private hands where they can be managed effectively. I think that is what Treasury's public-private partnership is trying to do without creating an agency, if you will, to do it. And I think it will work. They are on the right path. I have not looked at all the details of it. It is critical that you have price exposure, that you let people bid on these packages, that they not be directed to individual purchasers. It is important that you have transparency. And the key to all of it is that--and the big difference between the current plan is we were dealing with debt institutions. They were closed, and then we took the assets out and repackaged them.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","So they did not care what price they got because they were not in existence anymore. We, on the other hand, would sell assets to maximize recovery for the taxpayers, and we got a lot of it back. The whole--this plan, one of the critical issues will be, at what price will a bank, that is still doing business, that is carrying stuff on its books at 60, that maybe is worth 15, are they going to be willing to sell it into one of these public-private partnerships----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","----that is at a realistic price.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","That is absolutely critical. And in a globalized electronic market, the margin of error is so much narrower than it has ever been in the history of commerce. A mistake now is measured in milliseconds.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Right. But let me ask--I mean, I agree with that. And I am going to turn to Senator Shelby. I agree with that. I think it is a very good point, not Madoff enough. Everyone is wondering whether there will be buyers. I think the issue is whether or not there will be sellers. That is really going to be the issue, will you sell. I am just imagining this. And, again, I am just listening to some folks, and we have a panel coming up who can maybe shed some more light on this. My guess is if you are a board of a bank, and you are sitting there, and someone is saying, we think this thing is worth more than what they are offering, my reaction might be, you know what, get rid of this stuff; let's move along. The credit markets are not going to open up until we get this unclogged. And while you may be right, and I am sure it is worth more than what they are offering here, let's move along. I have to believe that thinking may have some influence on the decision of sellers to move the product along. I know it affects balance sheets, though. But the larger good here is, get this moving. So I do not know whether that is going to be the case or not, but that is the counter argument I have heard about whether or not sellers will sell. I do not mean to dwell on all of this, but it is an interesting point. Let me turn to Senator Shelby. I have taken way too much time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Mr. Breeden, you were chairman of the SEC from 1989 to 1993. Mr. Levitt, you were chairman of the SEC from 1993 to 2001. We know Mr. Atkins was a commissioner there for some 8 years, I believe it was. In looking back at your time at the SEC, what could each of you have done differently that would have helped to prevent the roots of the current crisis from growing? Mr. Breeden? You were there a while back, I know that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","We did everything we could, and I suppose you can always do more----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","----to maintain market discipline. I have a deep faith that continues to this very day, that markets do a better job disciplining risk than bureaucrats do. So I did not want the SEC trying to figure out if Drexel Burnham would say-- should stay in business or not. I wanted the market to decide that. We tried to draw the line and make clear that too big to fail did not include the securities industry; that if you extended credit to a securities firm, do it on the basis of their creditworthiness because we were not going to bail you out if you got it wrong. I wish we had established that principle more clearly, because to the extent that anybody out there thought Lehman Brothers or Bear Sterns were inside a taxpayer protection umbrella that would have allowed them to borrow more money, get more credit than their own balance sheet warranted--and I think we get into so many problems of distortion in the marketplace. You saw it with Fannie and Freddie, you see it with any area where you have moral hazard where people are thinking, well, I can lend money here because if it goes wrong, taxpayers, the government, will somehow step in and bail it out. We did the right things when I was there to try and make sure we drew the line and said, in the securities industry, you are on your own, but I suppose we could have done it better.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Levitt.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","A day does not go by when I do not think about this very question. The first mistake I made was not pressing harder for an immediate resolution of the issue of expensing stock options. We are now entering a decade or transparency, where every rule, every regulation, every judgment will be judged by the metric of how transparent it is. That was a case in point. Second was maybe the most important issue of all. There came a time when the chairwoman of the CFTC came to the President's Working Group and said, it is time to regulate swaps. Alan Greenspan, Bob Rubin and others said, that is impossible. You cannot do it. We have trillions of dollars of outstanding contracts. It is the wrong thing to do; do not do it. I went along with it. I went along with it without taking the additional step of saying, wait a second. Maybe we have those contracts out there. Let's grandfather them, and going forward, let's regulate them, mandate them to go on an exchange, give them transparency. I did not call for a mandated central clearing facility, and that was a mistake that I will regret as long as I think about these things.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","But there is nothing like transparency in anything, is there?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","And confidence to bring trust back to the market.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Essential.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Essential.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","Thank you, Senator Shelby. You know that commissioners can be literally the fifth wheel at the SEC, but----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","But you are part of the system.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","Definitely, and I tried to ring the gong down through the years. I think one thing is that the SEC probably became a little bit too focused on the equity markets and, to a lesser extent, the options markets, and did not pay enough attention to the debt side, including as Chairman Levitt was just talking about, munis. And the real question is do the equity markets still function as the primary price discovery mechanism because a lot of that has shifted to the debt side. So I think there needs to be new types of skill sets at the SEC. Second was maybe not speaking out more loudly and often about some of the backoffice and documentation issues for CDOs and the CDSs down through the years. Then, finally, with respect to the enforcement program at the SEC, I think what has happened over the years is that the senior staff has tendeding to chase headlines rather than to look at real cases that hurt real investors, Ponzi schemes and stock manipulations, really disparaging them as ``slip and fall''--or unimportant--cases.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Breeden, you know, as well as everybody does, the Federal Reserve is not only the central bank but it is the regulator of our holding companies, our largest banks. I believe myself that they have utterly failed as a regulator, utterly, because most of our Wall Street banks that got in trouble, and some of them are in trouble today, still, were regulated by the Federal Reserve. So that causes me great heartburn when we start talking about the Federal Reserve as the systemic risk regulator, you know, the all powerful thing. Explain your concerns about having the Fed serve in the role as a systemic regulator.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Well, Senator, I think this is a terribly important subject, and I really hope people stop and think about this. The Fed does, as lender of last resort--and I hope we will always have a central bank, not the world's largest hedge fund, over at the Federal Reserve. But as lender of last resort, well, you can only cram so many--every time the Fed buys everybody else's broken assets, you are not really fixing those assets, you are just moving them over to the Federal Reserve. And there are limits to how you do that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","They seem to be keeping a lot of them too long.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Well, they do not get more valuable as you hold them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I know.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","So this lender of last resort role has always given the Fed a stature and an importance in the system, and it is quite genuine; central banks do play a critical role. But their primary role is, of course, monetary policies, stability of the currency, and you will always pick Fed chairmen and Fed Governors to get good economists who will do that role well. Regulation is kind of off on the side. Who really runs regulation in the Fed, I am not sure anybody ever really knows.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Maybe they did not have anybody running it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Well, bottom line, there is probably $800 billion in equity losses at Citicorp, B of A, WaMu, Wachovia, all institutions, which, as you point out, were regulated by the Fed. So the idea that we are now going to add to their plate GE and IBM and General Motors and every other--United Technologies, and anybody else who makes something important-- well, they make elevators, and elevators is certainly systemically important; we cannot get around without them. Who knows what ends up in that----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Just be careful of the names you use here, you are throwing out.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Well, I thought you might notice, Mr. Chairman. So I worry you are creeping very far into industrial policy. And I go back to my comment earlier. You cannot stop everybody from failing. You have to have a mechanism where the people who were unsuccessful get taken over and replaced by people who are successful. So the farther we go into saying the Fed will oversee everybody big in the economy--their expertise is looking at banks, not other kinds of firms. So you are putting people who do not have the experience and do not have the expertise in charge of regulating people, and you will get bad regulation. You will have the illusion of regulation, but maybe not the successful outcome.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","You said their expertise was looking at banks. Now, that is very debatable today----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","At best.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","----because if they are the regulators I said earlier, and they are, of our holding companies, and our banks, so many of our big banks failed under their supervision, that says a lot to me about the Fed's inadequacies. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think Senator Shelby asked a very good question in terms of what mistakes were made, and I appreciate the candor of the witnesses. I do think that one of the things Mr. Atkins said that struck home to me, as somebody who has been around the markets for some time, is over the last 10, 15-plus years, the enormous focus on the equity side as opposed to the debt side. And as the debt side got more and more complicated, I think it even got, perhaps, less focused. So I think a very valid point. Following up on the chairman's comment as well, about whether we are going to have willing sellers, I do think there is--and I know you have had these meetings, Senator Shelby. Senator Corker has had these meetings as well where you have got the hedge fund community saying everything is melting down and the banks saying, no, we are actually fine. Maybe the stress test will give us, if they are applied with some rigor, some winnowing out process and push those who fall below into this sales procedure. I have just got word that the Budget Committee is, which I am on, is in the markup. So let me just ask a question and not be able to stay for the answer. But I would like to start with Chairman Levitt, I guess. Earlier, we had Chairman Schapiro in, and we were asking about say on pay. I would be curious to have you and your colleagues' comments on say on pay. And I would also love to hear just your more general comments. Nobody thinks we are going to unscramble the eggs post-Glass-Steagall, but I would like your comments about what should be some of the underlying principles. Should we acknowledge that all institutions are going to be able to do all things on a going-forward basis, and what challenges and opportunities does that present us in terms of a new regulatory structure? Again, my apologies to the Members that I have to go down and vote in this markup. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Warner.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","There was a question there, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Oh. I see. I thought you were walking out, so I apologize.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","With respect to say on pay, what I would say about this, this sounds like an easy call. How can you be against it? And I am not. But I think it is simplistic. It can be a check the box kind of mentality, which businesses can easily incorporate and just move on. I urge any legislation to allocate to the SEC the responsibility of defining exactly what that means under what circumstances, how it is done, how far down it goes, what the details should be, what the explanation should be, what the history should be. Not simply pass a rule because, I assure you, it looks differently than if you refine it in a way that I think the Commission should be charged with doing.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Just on say on pay, real briefly, I am chairman of the Board of H&R Block, and we put say on pay in voluntarily last year. It works fine. It is good to let shareholders express their views. If they do not like your pay policies, then you ought to find out about it sooner rather than later. And we did the same thing at Zale Corporation, where I am on the board. We put it in voluntarily. I think the American business community has been resisting something that is simple, easy and an appropriate step to take. I share Arthur's concern that say on pay alone is not going to fix our compensation problems. You really have to have some ability--if compensation committees do outrageous things--and we have all seen examples of profligate compensation that can get seriously out of whack. You have to go beyond that and have either majority voting every year where shareholders can try and withhold votes or voting against members of a compensation committee. And, ultimately, you have to have the threat that if boards do not do a good job managing compensation policy, that they could be replaced. And until you do that, an advisory vote that just every year says you are doing a terrible job is not going to solve the problem.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Well said.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","With respect to say on pay, I am an advocate for federalism. I think that Congress needs to be, or should be, a little bit leery of wading into this issue. We do not have a Federal corporate code or anything like that. I think once you start wading into it, the question becomes, where do you stop? And, maybe Congress should concentrate, like you did in Sarbanes-Oxley, on empowering the SROs, the stock exchanges and others, and then maybe leave it to the states to do what they deem appropriate--states acting and the shareholders acting within the ambit of the state laws and regulations as best suits the individual situation.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think this testimony you all have given I think has been outstanding this morning. I could not agree more with you, Mr. Breeden, about the boards. I think there is a lot of reforms that need to take place to strengthen boards' responsibility to oversee and to give, I think, shareholders some powers that they now do not have. We have had numbers of conversations regarding that. I could not agree more. Mr. Levitt, it is amazing to me, this fascination where somehow another changing accounting rule actually changes the status of an entity. While I do think there should be some degree of judgment, which I know the SEC ruled upon, anyway, several months ago--it has not had the uptick from the public accounting entities yet. But I think your comments are right- on. And it is amazing to me that people would think that an accounting rule would actually change the actual status of an entity, but I thank you for that. Then, Mr. Chairman, I do think the seller issue you talked about is real. I think the securities will fly out the door because they have already been marked to market, and people sort of know what--they have marked them down realistically. I think on the whole loans or the assets, we are going to have a serious problem. And I think that piece has got to be worked through. And, certainly, if those assets are sold below where they are--of course, there is a different set of accounting standards that go there. We are talking about, in combination with the stress test, additional capital going into these entities, right? And it could be coordinated in a way that I think could be very helpful. But let me go back to Mr. Breeden. You mentioned having this special court to deal with some of these complex entities. And then on the other hand, there is the whole issue of protecting citizens for those that are not ready to go into that. So a resolution entity of some kind may be necessary, even if you had a structure for entities to move into Chapter Is that true or false?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Senator, I would say if you had the right Chapter 11 mechanism, you would not need an intermediate step. Companies would operate as long as they could get the liquidity and the credit to operate. If they got to a point where they could not, bang, you would make a filing that--like Chapter 11 does, you stop the ability of people to shut an entity down while it goes through this reorganization process. So I do not think you would need an agency as a sort of warming tent for a special court. I think if you did it right, that court would be able to do things earlier. And one of the problems with Chapter 11 and financial institutions is it is loaded under current law toward liquidation, and that is what I think you have got to fix.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","I would like to add one point to that, and it goes to the general tone of all of this testimony. Whether we have a court, whether we have a resolution, whether we have new rules, and whether we have a systemic regulator, do not under any circumstances allow that to diminish the investor protections offered by the SEC. The consequence of that kind of action, no matter how nice it sounds, not matter how pretty its dressing may look, would be to turn that agency into a Betty Crocker kind of agency, which does nice things for investors, but has no bite, has no power, has no authority. It just stands up there as an empty symbol. That is the danger of creating these systems of oversight and systemic risk and whatever it is that you call it. Do not allow investors to be hurt by this process.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you very much. Let me move on. This economic Darwinism that Mr. Levitt referred to earlier, we see--I think we are going to have a task force report on the automotive industry that is going to come out, and they are going to lay out what futuristic things need to occur. Does the fact that debtor in possession financing is difficult to get today, does that in any way affect your view of economic Darwinism, if you will?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Senator, I----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Meaning that if somebody goes into Chapter 11--under the WorldCom scenario, you had the ability to finance assets that were of value. There are people that I think would argue very strongly, and probably have a great point as we see what is happening, that there is not financing available for that kind of thing. Does that in any way affect your thoughts on entities like that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Senator, I think you have put your finger on a terribly important issue, the availability of debtor in possession financing, and that is an area where a resolution authority might be able to--finding liquidity for those facilities, particularly if you suddenly need a giant one to deal with an AIG or something of that magnitude, would be an area that could conceivably be very helpful in working out with the Federal Reserve what form of public-private financing, if we are having inadequate liquidity in debtor in possession financing, Because without that, reorganization does not work. You know, Arthur was being a little critical of my economic Darwinism, but I am really unrepentant on that. If companies fail, you need to let them fail, and you need to let them be replaced by people who do a better job of managing. It does not mean that they will disappear from the face of the Earth. What we call Bank of America today really was once North Carolina National Bank. And a lot of other banks failed, and they got put together, and it grew and grew. Well, you can put these institutions together by acquisitions, and you can also take them apart by divesting things, making them smaller and more manageable, and arguably you sometimes make companies a lot better and a lot more valuable when they get back to a more manageable focus and size. So you do need the DIP financing. That is a critical role--","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So you would advocate then potentially, instead of all the activism that we have had through Treasury and TARP and certainly now a Treasury Secretary, it appears, who wants to codify TARP, you would actually argue instead that we consider as a body creating a debt in possession financing mechanism that would allow people to go into an orderly Chapter 11 and have the ability to finance out in lieu of that. Is that what you are arguing?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","You have done a better job than I could of articulating that, but I think that coupled with having the ultimate decisions not made by a Cabinet Secretary but made by somebody wearing a black robe, I think having the courts be involved--because then you have the ability to deal with contracts for bonuses and to deal with the fact that the entity has more obligations than it has money to pay for them. And so they all need to be restructured, and doing that through the rule of law rather than every Sunday night somebody in an administrative agency makes a decision and announces it, if it stuns the market, I really like the protections as an investor. I like the protection knowing if I make an investment, what rights do I have, and who is going to back them up, and that that is going to be done through the judicial system ultimately. So I would marry up your suggestion of a DIP financing facility, if you will, with the judicial oversight, and I think we would then have something that would be very workable.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I know my time is up. I want to say that Mr. Breeden's opening comments to me were pretty clairvoyant and somewhat chilling in light of what we see happening. We have this Trojan horse. You know, it looks really pretty and it sounds really pretty, and I am talking about the systemic regulator being an entity.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","That is not going to happen.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I know that you, for what it is worth, have looked at--I know you talked with Susan Collins the other day about something she has put forth. I have to tell you, based on what I sense and feel, I think it would be one of the worst mistakes we could possibly make to put in one person's hands that ability. I do think very quickly we would move into industrial policy issues, things way beyond--I mean, we will never define properly systemic risk. I mean, it could move into all kinds of things, like WorldCom or other things. I thank you for pursuing that route. I see Senator Shelby nodding. But I hope we will resist any move--any move--that gives anybody that kind of power and basically renders almost every other entity in Government useless.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","One of the things we learned, going back in Richard Breeden's day, is that you cannot have the regulator in a sense also be responsible for the resolution of these matters. What I said the other day is an entity that only talks to itself is dangerous in a sense when you get to these matters. And so that is why I, for one--again, I want to make it clear as well. I have not written anything, I have not--I am just listening, as we all are, to these various ideas and what make sense. And I like Richard Breeden's idea of this one, whether or not you can do this kind of a thing, but I agree with him the notion of getting--so you get resolution. I mean, the whole idea of calling it resolution is to get to a resolution on these matters.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","And so we need to think carefully how we do it, but I agree with you, Senator, that this has got to be one that is thought out and has balance to it. These are complicated institutions today, either by design or acquiescence, and so, therefore, to look at them and how you unwind requires a lot more eyes on this than would come from one single entity. The danger of doing that seems to me to only complicate the problem to some degree. So I think we sort of agree on that. I just want to make--and we have got to go to that. Jack Reed has shown up who has done a terrific job as the Chairman of the subcommittee on Securities, and I invoked your name earlier without your permission, and that is, there is a lot of interest in Chairman Schapiro's testimony today and suggested that maybe the subcommittee would continue, formally or informally, following up the conversations with the SEC. I wanted to mention a subject matter, and just because it has come to my attention, and that is, this resetting or repricing of options. I have been reading some stories about how, obviously, with the decline in the price of various stocks, where options were taken on them, on the assumption, of course, their value would continue to increase--and it has done exactly the opposite. But whether or not certain people at a certain level are resetting the option at the lower price at the expense of shareholders who do not have that same ability raises some serious issues, in my view. And I was going to raise it with Jack, may draft a letter, in fact, to the SEC and others to find out what is going on with this. Again, I am reading news reports about it, so I want to be careful about suggesting something is absolutely the case. But, nonetheless, it is disturbing to me that that may be happening. And so we may want to look at that. We will draft something along those lines and get some answers very quickly. I do not know if you have seen anything like that. I do not know if either of our witnesses have seen any reports on the resetting of options at a certain level. Have you seen this as well?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Through the years, this is part of the compensation issue, and it is something----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, it is huge. You go from something that was $100 and it moves to $5 or $10 more, that is value. If you are going from $100 down to $10 and all of a sudden that stock goes to $20, and you have reset it at $10 for a handful of people, that makes some of these other issues pale by comparison.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Some companies have set and reset and reset and reset and reset again.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I do not know how my colleagues feel, but it is something we ought to look at.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","Mr. Chairman, it is another area where having large shareholders being able to be on the board--I guarantee that in companies where our fund sits on the board of directors, there will be no repricing of options. And, you know, shareholders are the ones who are hurt by that because nobody repriced for us the cost of our shares. And so management, yes, going forward there may be new options granted each year at different prices.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","That is another matter.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Breeden","But it is really a terrible abuse when people go back and reprice from the past. It was an incentive to make the stock worth more, grow value for the shareholders, and really, you are jumping off the train and saying I am going to go give myself a special deal. That is a very serious problem.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I am hearing sort of----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Atkins","One note of caution there is that this issue is not just a monolithic type of thing. Every company is different. Every situation might be different. I think you will probably hear that if you write the letter to the SEC. The response will be in various situations, it sometimes might be justifiable and the shareholders might have approved it.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, again, it is certainly worthy of quick examination because this is the kind of thing that, again, in a week or two from now we will pick up our newspapers and discover that this has gone on and no one has paid attention to it. It will pale--if you think you had a furor over what happened last week, watch this one. And so let me just use this forum as an opportunity to send a message, before we get a letter written, that someone ought to be looking at it immediately, and I would like to hear back what steps, if any, are being taken to deal with it. They will respond accordingly, and maybe we will get some people in front of us to talk about it. And you are right, there may be different circumstances. I am not trying to have a sweeping statement here, but, nonetheless, you are hearing from witnesses and others, this is troubling, to put it mildly. So we will take a look at it. Anyway, we are going to keep the questions open. We could have you here virtually all day, the three of you, and it is so valuable. I cannot thank you enough for appearing this morning, and we will submit some additional questions. There is an awful lot to ask you. We are just doing the securities field. There are a number of issues. I appreciate, by the way, Arthur, your comment on the muni issue, the bond issue. This is very important. Your language was very strong. In our private conversations, you have expressed this to me as well. And certainly this Committee will take a look at it, a completely very unregulated area and one that poses some real risks, and I appreciate you bringing that point up.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Levitt","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","With that, this panel will be excused, and we thank you for coming. I am going to introduce the next panel, and I am going to thank them for their testimony in advance. I want to thank Jack Reed for his willingness to chair. I am not going to be here for all of this. I will be here for a few minutes of it, anyway, but let me begin and I will introduce them. Richard Ketchum is the Chairman and CEO of FINRA. He is also Chairman of the World Federation of the Exchanges' Regulatory Committee. Ronald Stack has served on the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board since 2006 and is Managing Director of Barclays Capital, with responsibility for the firm's national public sector investment banking effort. Richard Baker is President and Chief Executive Officer of the Managed Funds Association, a former colleague of ours, served in the other body, previously a member of the U.S.--as I mentioned, a member of the House of Representatives, Chairman of the subcommittee on Capital Markets for 12 years. Jim Chanos is Chairman of the Coalition of Private Investment Companies. Mr. Chanos is also President of Kynikos Associates, a New York private investment management company. Barbara Roper is the Director of Investment Protection for the Consumer Federation of America. David Tittsworth is the Executive Director and Executive Vice President of the Investment Adviser Association. Dan Curry is the President of DBRS' U.S. affiliate. Previously he spent 22 years at Moody's Investor Service.

"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, can I say something?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, you certainly may. Let me thank all of you, and we are packing you in here. I apologize. I hope you found this morning interesting. At least you have been sitting here and listening to the Chairmen of the Securities and Exchange Commission and then our last panel, so I am sure you would have been paying very close attention had you not been asked to be here. But having you in the room, I kept on looking out to see how you were reacting to some of the things that were being said. I saw some commonality of interest being expressed on certain matters and some dismay at others, I guess, along the way. So I was watching the nodding heads along the process. Let me turn to Senator Shelby for some comments quickly, and then we will get to our panel and ask you to share some thoughts with us on the subject matter before us.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, I appreciate these hearings that you are putting together, and, gosh, we could be here all week and learn a heck of a lot. I have reviewed this testimony of the third panel. A very, very impressive panel. A lot of you I know. And all of your testimony is interesting. Jim Chanos' testimony I think goes right to the heart of a lot of things of what is wrong, and I think we ought to pay particular attention to that. The reason I am bringing this up, I, too, have got a luncheon I have got to speak at. You know, I am not leaving yet, but I might miss some of you. But I want to thank you, like Senator Dodd did, for your contribution. And as we go through this trying to find out what went wrong and trying to do what should be right in the future, I think we are going to be very careful and very comprehensive.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I thank you for that. Richard Baker, a former colleague. You got to be on this side of the dais and now that side of the dais. For 12 years you were on this side, so I have gotten to know Richard very, very well, and he does a fine job on behalf of the people he represents as well.

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ketchum","Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am Richard Ketchum, Chairman and CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA. On behalf of FINRA, I would like to thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I commend you, Mr. Chairman, for having today's hearing on the critically important topic of reforming our regulatory structure for financial services. As someone who has spent the great majority of my career as a regulator, dedicated to protecting investors and improving market integrity, I am deeply troubled by our system's recent failures. The credit crisis and scandals of the last year have painfully demonstrated how the gaps in our current fragmented regulatory system can allow significant activity and misconduct to occur outside the view and reach of regulators. FINRA shares this Committee's commitment to identifying these gaps and weaknesses and improving the system for investors. Let me briefly talk about FINRA and our regulatory role. FINRA regulates the practices of nearly 4,900 securities firms and more than 650,000 registered securities representatives. As an independent regulatory organization, FINRA provides the first line of oversight for broker-dealers. FINRA augments and deepens the reach of the Federal securities laws with detailed and enforceable ethical rules and a host of comprehensive regulatory oversight programs. We have a robust and comprehensive examination program with dedicated resources of more than 1,000 employees. FINRA has the ability to bring enforcement actions against firms and their employees who violate the rules. Mr. Chairman, as I said earlier, the topic of today's hearing is critical. The failures that have rocked our financial system have laid bare the regulatory gaps that must be fixed if investors are to have the confidence to re-enter the markets. Our current system of financial regulation leads to an environment where investors are left without consistent and effective protections when dealing with financial professionals. At the very least, our system should require that every person who provides financial advice and sells a financial product be licensed and tested for competence, that advertising for products not be misleading; that every product marketed to an investor is appropriate for that particular investor; and that comprehensive disclosure exists for services and products. I would like to highlight the regulatory gap that, in our view, is among the most glaring examples of what needs to be addressed--the disparity between oversight regimes for broker- dealers and investment advisers. The lack of a comprehensive, investor-level examination program for investment advisers impacts the level of protection for every person that entrusts funds to an adviser. In fact, the Madoff Ponzi scheme highlighted what can happen when a regulator like FINRA has only free rein to see one side of the business. Let me be clear. I mention this example not because FINRA is sanguine with its role in the Madoff tragedy. Any regulator who had any responsibility for oversight for Madoff must accept accountability and search diligently for lessons learned. But the way to identify fraud, just as with sales practice abuse, is not through the fog of jurisdictional restrictions. Fragmented regulation provides opportunities to those who would cynically game the system to do so at great harm to investors, and it must be changed. The regulatory regime for investment advisers should be expanded to include an additional component of oversight by an independent regulatory organization, similar to that which exists for broker-dealers. The SEC and State securities regulators play vital roles in overseeing both broker-dealers and investment advisers, and they should continue to do so. But it is clear that dedicating more resources to regular and vigorous examination and day-to-day oversight of investment advisers could improve investor protection for their customers, just as it has for customers of broker-dealers. Broker-dealers are subject to rules established and enforced by FINRA that pertain to safety of customer cash and assets, advertising, sales practices, limitations on compensation, and financial responsibility. FINRA ensures firms are following the rules with a comprehensive exam and enforcement regime. Simply put, FINRA believes that the kind of additional protections provided to investors through its model are essential. Does that mean FINRA should be given that role for investment advisers? That question must ultimately be answered by Congress and the SEC, but we do believe FINRA is uniquely positioned from a regulatory standpoint to build an oversight program quickly and efficiently. In FINRA's view, the best oversight system for investment advisers would be one that is tailored to fit their services and role in the market, starting with the requirements that are currently in place for advisory activity. Simply exporting in wholesale fashion the broker-dealer rulebook or current governance would not make sense. We stand ready to work with Congress and the SEC to find solutions that fill the gaps in our current regulatory system and create a regulatory environment that works properly for all investors. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be happy to answer any questions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and we will look forward to some questions for you, too.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stack","Thank you very much. Good morning, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. I am Ronald Stack, Chair of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board. By way of background, I have been involved in the municipal market since 1975 when I was a member of the staff of Governor Hugh Carey during the New York City fiscal crisis. I am pleased today to testify on behalf of the MSRB at the Committee's second hearing on Enhancing Investor Protection and the Regulation of the Securities Markets. The MSRB was created by the Congress in 1975 to write rules for municipal securities dealers, at that time many of whom were unregulated, unsupervised, and not even registered by the SEC. Our mission was set in statute, and it remains clear and unambiguous, and that is, to protect the investing public and to promote a fair and efficient market for municipal securities. This is a $2.7 trillion municipal market, and it is fundamental to financing our Nation's infrastructure. Indeed, over 55,000 entities issue $400 billion in municipal securities each year. We are absolutely committed to preserving municipal access to capital, the municipal market's integrity, and investor protection. This is our mission, this is our commitment. We believe one of the important ways to protect investors and preserve market integrity is through a culture of transparency, one that makes information available to all. Historically, access to public disclosure about municipal bonds has been hindered by a severely fragmented disclosure system that was cobbled together over the years. This system did not promote public access to disclosure documents, and it did nothing to shine a light on the disclosure practices of issuers, good or bad. So what have we done? The MSRB has developed a comprehensive Web site that is transforming municipal disclosure and transparency for all investors, large and small, institutional and retail. It is called the Electronic Municipal Market Access system, which we call it EMMA, and it is so advanced that we believe it exceeds disclosure systems for any other fixed-income market, and that includes corporate bonds. With EMMA, all investors have free access on the Web to an incredible amount of information about municipal securities. We have had real-time trading information up since 2005. We have added official statements and information about auction rates. Starting next week, we will add information about variable rates, and finally, in July of this year, pursuant to a rule amendment that was passed by the SEC in December, we will be including what is called ``continuing disclosure filings,'' which are up-to-date material changes from bond issuers. Our new system of making continuing disclosure available easily and on the Web will be a vast improvement over the current system. EMMA will serve as a red flag for poor disclosure by issuers, just as it reveals good disclosure practices. But good, timely dissemination of disclosure is only one of our myriad responsibilities. We require municipal securities dealers to observe the highest professional standards in their dealings with investors: full disclosure, suitability, fair pricing. We are the only Federal regulator that has successfully implemented a ban on ``pay to play.'' If you are a municipal securities professional, you cannot do business with an issuer if you have contributed to one of its officials. We test professionals' qualifications and we require them to take continuing education courses. We have a complete set of rules regulating municipal dealers that we constantly review, modify, and change as necessary. And I emphasize all of our rules are sent out for comment and then are subject to strict review and approval by the SEC itself. Unfortunately, we continue to read reports--and I think this is something which I think Chairman Levitt was referring to--about other municipal market participants who engage in ``pay to play'' and similar activities. Some are alleged and some are still under investigation, but whatever the outcome, the market suffers from an appearance problem, and that is not good for the muni market or for any market. Earlier this year, we wrote to you and your colleagues in the House Financial Services Committee about the potential for regulation of some or all of these other market participants. They serve critical roles in many of the complex financing and related derivative transactions that have become commonplace. They advise State and local governments, big and small, on how to structure a bond issue, how to sell it, how to market it, what type of securities to sell, how to invest bond proceeds, whether to use swaps or other related derivatives. We believe these and other similar market participants should be registered with the SEC and regulated by the MSRB with rules similar to those already applied to dealers. Many of these people are fiduciaries, and they should be subject to the standards of professional conduct. ``Pay to play'' should be prohibited, just like it was prohibited for dealers by the MSRB in 1994. I want to emphasize that I know many of these participants, and many of the individuals are ethical and well qualified, but, unfortunately, not all of them are and activities of a few can taint the entire market if not by fact, by appearance. That is something we cannot afford, especially in the current crisis. During this time of stress, it is crucial that we have clear guideposts and that investor confidence in the municipal securities market is not undermined by questionable practices. Also, as Treasury seeks to find solutions to assist the municipal bond market through the crisis, ensuring that all market participants adhere to the highest professional standards is essential. The MSRB looks forward to working with the Committee, as well as other regulators and market participants, to ensure that the level of investor protection provided in the municipal market is second to none. Senators, thank you for inviting the MSRB to participate in this very important hearing.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RONALD A. STACK, CHAIR, MUNICIPAL SECURITIES RULEMAKING BOARD"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Stack. Richard Baker, we welcome you to the Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, Members. I am indeed delighted to be back after the prohibited period from my engagement with policymakers, and for the record to reflect, I did not engage anyone during the prohibited period. It is delightful to be here today. The MFA represents a majority of the world's largest hedge funds and is the primary advocate for sound business practices for industry professionals. We appreciate the opportunity to be invited and to comment today about the systemic risk concerns, and we are committed to being a constructive participant in the discussion going forward. Hedge funds do provide liquidity and price discovery to markets, capital to companies to allow them to grow or turn their businesses around, and sophisticated risk management tools for investors such as pensions, to allow them to meet their obligations. To perform these market functions, we require sound counterparties and stable market structures. The current lack of certainty regarding financial conditions of major financial institutions has limited the effectiveness of the stabilization efforts, and this uncertainty inhibits investors' willingness to put their capital at risk or transact with these firms. The relative size and scope of the industry helps explain why we believe hedge funds do not pose significant systemic risk despite the current market environment. With an estimated $1.5 trillion under management, the hedge fund industry is significantly smaller than the $9.4 million mutual fund industry or the $13.8 trillion banking industry. Because many hedge funds use little or no leverage, contrary to many public comments, their losses did not pose the same potential systemic concerns that losses at more highly leveraged institutions presented. One recent study found that 26.9 percent of hedge funds do not deploy leverage at all, and a recent 2009 report by the FSA, the Financial Services Authority, indicated that the leverage of hedge funds was, on average, less than 3:1. Mr. Chairman, the hedge fund industry was not the root cause of the ongoing difficulties in our financial markets, but we have a shared interest with all other market participants in re-establishing a sound financial system. To that end, restoration of stability can be accomplished through a careful, deliberate approach toward the goal of a smart financial regulatory construct, one which would include investor protections as well as a systemic risk analysis. Smart regulation means improving the overall functioning of the financial system through appropriate, effective, and efficient regulation, while encouraging adoption of industry best practices which promote efficient capital markets, integrity, investor protections, and enabling better monitoring of potential systemic risk events. We believe that a single systemic risk organization--and I have not been absent during the preceding discussions. I would merely want to point out that an organization charge with this responsibility would be better than multiple systemic regulators which would likely have difficulty because of jurisdictional conflicts, unintended regulatory gaps, inefficient and costly redundancies. So to the extent a regulatory shop can be constructed, it should be a single entity to have that responsibility. We do support confidential reporting to that systemic regulatory structure by entities the regulator deems to be of systemic relevance any information the regulator deems necessary or advisable for it to assess systemic risk potential. It is important for this authority to allow the regulator to be forward-looking and adaptable to ever-changing market conditions. It is critical that reported information be granted full protection from public disclosure, which we believe can be done without inhibiting the ability of the regulator to protect the overall system. In our view, the mandate of this entity should be protection of the financial system and not include investor protection or market integrity, a role that already exists in the hands of multiple existing regulatory bodies. With respect to that mandate, because systemically relevant firms likely would not pose the same risk in all circumstances, we also believe the regulators should not focus on preventing the failure of a particular firm but, rather, only in the event that firm's failure would be likely to bring about adverse financial system consequences. We strongly believe the systemic risk regulator should implement its authority in a way that avoids competitive concerns and moral hazards that could result from a firm having an ongoing established Government guarantee against its failure. Therefore, we believe a systemic risk regulator would need authority to seek to prevent systemic risk in a forward- looking manner, address systemic concerns once they have arisen in the manner it deems appropriate, the ability to ensure that a failing firm does not threaten the financial system, and we know that policymakers are also contemplating concurrently a notion of a prudential regulatory framework, including mandatory registration. We believe that well-advised regulation should be based on the following principles: regulation that is tailored to meet identified needs, not nebulous in construct; second, ongoing public-private exchange with notice, comment, and implementation so that appropriate comment may be made on proposed regulatory interventions; reporting of appropriate information, which could be left to the regulator, with confidentiality of sensitive and proprietary always being protected. Regulatory distinctions to be recognized between the various nature of the differing market participants, and encouragement of strong industry practices and robust investor diligence. I would like to mention just briefly one other area I know of concern. Short selling facilitates price discovery, mitigates asset bubbles, and increases market liquidity. It is a critical risk management tool for investors which allows them to take long positions in the market. There are absolute solutions to address the stated concerns about short-selling that would enable us to continue in our current market practices without jeopardizing the important market benefits. We look forward to a continued discussion and answering any questions you may choose to pose. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Reed . Thank you, Congressman Baker.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RICHARD BAKER, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MANAGED FUNDS ASSOCIATION"
"Mr. Chanos","Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee. My name is Jim Chanos. I am here today testifying as Chairman of the Coalition of Private Investment Companies. I thank you for the opportunity to testify on this important subject today. The damage done by the collapse of global equity credit and asset-backed markets has been staggering in scope. The plain truth is that there is not a single market participant, from banker to dealer to end user and investor, that does not have to absorb some degree of responsibility for the difficulties we are confronting today. And while there is plenty of blame to spread around, there is little doubt that the root cause of the financial collapse lay at the large global diversified investment and commercial banks, insurance companies, and government-sponsored enterprises under direct regulatory scrutiny. Notably, hedge funds and investors have generally absorbed the painful losses of the past year without any government cushion or taxpayer assistance. While hedge funds and other types of private investment companies were not the primary catalyst for our current situation, it is also true that these private pools of capital should not be exempt from the regulatory modernization and improvement that will be developed based on lessons learned from the financial calamities of the past 20 months. CPIC believes that there are a few key principles that should be followed in establishing a regulatory regime for monitoring systemic risk. First, regulatory authority should be based upon activities and not actors. The same activities should be treated similarly, regardless of where it takes place. Proprietary trading at a major bank should not receive less scrutiny than the trading activity of a hedge fund. Second, the system should be geared to size, meaning overall size or relative importance in a given market and complexity. Third, all companies performing systemically important functions, such as credit rating agencies and others, should be included in this regime. Fourth, accuracy of required disclosures to shareholders and counterparties should be considered systemically significant. Fifth, the regulatory regime should be able to follow activities at systemically important entities regardless of the affiliated business unit in which the entity conducts these activities. Sixth and finally, the regulatory regime itself should be clear and unambiguous about the criteria that brings an entity under the new oversight regime. Increasing the financial regulation of hedge funds and other private investment companies carries both risks and benefits. I would like to chat about that for a few seconds. Relying on the fact of direct regulation in lieu of one's own due diligence will undermine those parts of the private sector that continue to work well and thus hamper the goal of restoring market strength and confidence. While it is clear that a regulator should have the ability to examine the activities of significant pools of capital to help mitigate against activities that would disrupt the markets, simply trying to wedge hedge funds and other private investment funds into the Investment Company Act or Investment Advisers Act is not likely to achieve that goal. If direct regulation is deemed necessary, Congress should consider a stand-alone statutory authority for the SEC or other regulator that permits the Commission to focus on market-wide issues that are relevant to managers of institutional funds while not undermining essential investor due diligence. Perhaps the most important role that hedge funds play is as investors in our financial system. To that end, CPIC believes that maximum attention should be paid to maintaining and increasing the transparency and accuracy of financial reporting to shareholders, counterparties, and the market as a whole. Undermining accounting standards may provide an illusion of temporary relief, but will ultimately result in less market transparency and a much longer recovery. Private investment companies play important roles in the market sufficiency and liquidity. They help provide price discovery, but they also play the role of financial detectives. Government actions that discourage investors from being skeptical, from being able to hear from differing opinions, or to review negative research ultimately harms the market. Indeed, some say that if Madoff Securities had been a public entity, short sellers would have blown a market whistle long ago. Honesty and fair dealing are at the foundation of investor confidence our markets have enjoyed for so many years. A sustainable economic recovery will not occur until investors can again feel certain that their interests come first and foremost with the companies, asset managers, and others with whom they invest their money and until they believe that regulators are effectively safeguarding them against fraud. CPIC is committed to working diligently with this Committee and other policymakers to achieve that difficult but necessary goal. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JAMES CHANOS, CHAIRMAN, COALITION OF PRIVATE INVESTMENT COMPANIES"

"Ms. Roper","Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today regarding the steps that the Consumer Federation of America believes are necessary to enhance investor protection and improve regulation of the securities market. My written testimony describes a dozen different policies in a dozen different areas. Out of respect for the length of today's hearing, I will confine my oral comments to just two of those, bringing the shadow banking system within the regulatory structure and reforming credit rating agencies. Before I get into the specifics of those issues, however, I would like to spend a brief moment discussing the environment in which this policy review is taking place. For nearly three decades, regulatory policy in this country has been based on a fundamental belief that market discipline and industry self- interest could be relied on to rein in Wall Street excesses. That was the philosophy that made the Fed deaf to warnings about unsustainable subprime mortgage lending. It was the philosophy that convinced an earlier Congress and administration to override efforts to regulate over-the-counter derivatives markets. And it is the philosophy that convinced financial regulators that financial institutions could be relied on to adopt appropriate risk management practices. In short, it was this misguided regulatory philosophy that brought about the current crisis and it is this philosophy that must change if we are to take the steps needed to prevent a recurrence. In talking about regulatory reform, many people have focused on creation of a Systemic Risk Regulator, and that is something CFA supports, although, as others have noted, the devil is in the details. We believe it is at least as important, however, to directly address the risks that got us into the current crisis in the first place, and that includes bringing the shadow banking system within the regulatory structure. Overwhelming evidence suggests that a primary use of the shadow banking system, and indeed a major reason for its existence, is to allow financial institutions to do indirectly what they would not be permitted to do directly in the regulated market. There are numerous examples of this in the recent crisis, including, for example, banks holding toxic assets through special purpose entities for which they would have had to set aside additional capital had they been held on balance sheets, or AIG offering insurance in the form of credit default swaps without any of the protections designed to ensure their ability to pay claims. The main justification for allowing these two systems to operate side by side, one regulated and one unregulated, is that sophisticated investors are capable of protecting their own interests. If that was true in the past, it is certainly not true today, and the rest of us are paying a heavy price for their failure to protect their interests. To be credible, therefore, any regulatory reform proposal must confront the shadow banking system issue head on. This does not mean that all financial activities must be subject to identical regulations, but it does mean that all aspects of the financial system must be subject to regulatory scrutiny. One focus of that regulation should be on protecting against risk that could spill over into the broader economy, but regulation should also apply basic principles of transparency, fair dealing, and accountability to these activities in recognition of two basic lessons of the current crisis: One, protecting investors and consumers contributes to the safety and stability of the financial markets; and two, the sheer complexity of modern financial products has made former measures of investor sophistication obsolete. Complex derivatives and mortgage-backed securities were the poison that contaminated the financial system, but it was their ability to attract high credit ratings that allowed them to penetrate every corner of the market. Given the repeated failure of the credit rating agencies in recent years to provide timely warnings of risk, it is tempting to conclude, as many have done, that the answer to this problem is simply to remove all references to credit ratings from our financial regulations. We are not yet prepared to recommend that step. Instead, we believe a better approach is found in simultaneously reducing, but not eliminating, our reliance on ratings; increasing the accountability of ratings agencies, by removing First Amendment protections that are inconsistent with their legally sanctioned status; and improving regulatory oversight. While we appreciate the steps Congress and this Committee in particular took in 2006 to enhance SEC oversight of ratings agencies, we believe the current crisis demands a more comprehensive response. As I said earlier, these are just two of the issues CFA believes deserve Congressional attention as part of a comprehensive reform plan. Nonetheless, we believe these two steps would go a long way toward reducing systemic risk, particularly combined with additional steps to improve regulatory oversight of systemic risks going forward. Bold plans are needed to match the scope of the crisis we face. CFA looks forward to working with this Commission to craft a reform plan that meets this test and restores investors' faith both in the integrity of our markets and in the effectiveness of our government in protecting their interests.","Statement","STATEMENT OF BARBARA ROPER, DIRECTOR OF INVESTOR PROTECTION, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA"
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tittsworth","Thank you, Senator Reed. We really appreciate the opportunity to testify today. The Investment Adviser Association represents the interests of SEC-registered investment advisers. The advisory profession serves a wide range of clients, including individuals, trusts, families, as well as institutions such as endowments, foundations, charities, State and local governments, pension funds, mutual funds, and hedge funds. There are about 11,000 SEC-registered advisers. Most of these are small businesses. About 7,500 employ ten or fewer employees, and 90 percent employ fewer than 50. Our statement outlines our views on broad regulatory reform topics, but I am just going to emphasize one point, the need to address true regulatory gaps in two situations. First, we continue to support the registration, regulation of hedge fund managers by the SEC. We believe that investors and the markets will benefit from the disclosure, compliance protocols, recordkeeping, examinations, and other requirements that accompany SEC registration. We also support regulation of credit default swaps and other derivatives. Action must be taken to ensure that they can no longer exist outside of the regulatory system. Our testimony also addresses two issues that directly relate to the Investment Advisers Act. The first is the so- called harmonization of broker and adviser regulation. This idea seems to be predicated on the notion that brokers and advisers do exactly the same thing and that one set of laws and regulations should apply to both. We respectfully disagree. There are differences between most broker-dealer and most investment advisers. Brokers, or the sell side, typically execute securities transactions and sell financial products. Investment advisers, the buy side, provide advisory services, including managing client portfolios. Brokers often are compensated by commissions from selling products or executing trades and any related financial advice is nondiscretionary, that is, requires customer consent to buy or sell. In contrast, advisers generally are compensated by fees and provide ongoing discretionary management of client assets. Finally, brokers generally have custody of customer assets, whereas most investment advisers use the services of independent third-party custodians. Because of these and other differences, it doesn't make sense to impose rules on investment advisers that are tailored to produce sales. In recent years, brokers have migrated toward the investment advisory business, blurring some of the traditional lines and creating investor confusion. Accordingly, we believe that fiduciary standards should apply to anyone who offers investment advice. This week, we joined with the State securities organization, NASAA, and the Consumer Federation of America in a joint letter to the Committee to underscore this very important point. The second issue addressed in our testimony is the proposed creation of a self-regulatory organization, or SRO, for investment advisers, which we oppose. Our statement outlines drawbacks to an SRO, including inherent conflicts of interest, questions about transparency, accountability, and oversight, and added costs and bureaucracy. We particularly oppose the idea of FINRA as the SRO for investment advisers, given its governance structure, costs, track record, and its bias favoring the broker-dealer regulatory model. In closing, we believe the SEC has the expertise and experience to best regulate our profession and it should have appropriate resources to do its job. Instead of creating an SRO for investment advisers, the following alternatives should be pursued. First, the SEC should be fully funded and Congress should examine alternatives to allow it to achieve long-term and more stable funding, including self-funding mechanisms. Second, as NASAA testified, the SEC should increase the $25 million threshold that separates SEC and State-registered advisers. Third, the SEC should improve its inspection program to better leverage and focus its resources. We would be pleased to work with the Committee and the SEC to explore additional ways to ensure the appropriate and effective regulation and oversight of investment advisers and I would be happy to respond to any questions. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DAVID G. TITTSWORTH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, INVESTMENT ADVISER ASSOCIATION"

"Ms. Bolger","I would like to state at the outset that we at S&P appreciate the seriousness of the current dislocation in the capital markets and the challenges it poses for the American and global economies. Restoring confidence is critical, and workable solutions will involve both governmental action and private initiative. S&P has a long tradition of and a strong cultural commitment to integrity and professionalism. We recognize, however, that a number of our recent ratings in the structured finance area have not performed in line with our historical standards. We have reflected on these events and we have made a number of changes to enhance our processes. Recent calls for increased regulation of credit rating agencies have arisen in large part out of the poor performance of structured finance securities issued between the middle of 2005 and the middle of 2007, the years in which subprime lending was at its peak. From a regulatory perspective, it is important to point out that the world in which virtually all of these structured finance ratings were issued is not the world that we live and find ourselves in today. NRSROs, such as S&P, are now subject to a robust regulatory regime. That regime starts with the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, which went into effect in June 2007, and the rules promulgated by the SEC under it. Those rules deal with important topics such as resources, potential conflicts of interest, misuse of nonpublic information, and potentially abusive and unfair practices. The SEC also has broad enforcement powers over NRSROs. Not only does the SEC have extensive examination and inspection authority, but it can take disciplinary action against NRSROs. Those include censure, fines, or even revocation of registration if it deems such action to be in the interest of investors. From my perspective as a participant in the process, the SEC has been an extremely active regulator in exercising its oversight authority. Last year, the SEC conducted an extensive examination of S&P focused on our structured finance ratings. The exam, which lasted several months, involved dozens of meetings and interviews, production of a significant volume of documents, and resulted in a number of recommendations that we are implementing. While the current regime has accomplished much in the short time it has been in place, we do believe additional measures could play a meaningful role in restoring investor confidence. Appropriate regulation can provide a level of comfort to investors that policies are being enforced and that there is consistency and integrity in the rating process. I also do want to note that we are pleased to be participating in the SEC's April 15 roundtable on rating agencies, which Chairman Schapiro referenced this morning. We also believe in an end-to-end approach for legislation and regulation. That is, it should be designed to cover all aspects of the capital markets that when taken together contribute in a systemic way to their functioning, with particular regard to ratings. Such an approach would include not just oversight of rating agencies, but also appropriate measures for those involved in generating the information that is used in the analysis, the sale and the marketing of the rated securities, and the use of ratings. For example, an important factor in ratings quality is the quality of information available to be analyzed. That information is not generated by rating agencies but by others, such as in the RMBS area, mortgage originators, and lenders. In our view, oversight of these entities and the roles they perform should be part of any regulatory approach. As detailed in my written statement, earlier this month, S&P published an article reflecting our thoughts on what a regulatory framework for rating agencies might look like. I have included a copy of that for the record. I would like to highlight here just two particular features. The first is analytical independence. For the markets to have confidence in ratings, they must be made independently. That means, of course, that the judgments must be free of conflicts of interest and undue commercial considerations. We are fully committed to that principle. It also means that the judgments must truly reflect the substantive views of the analysts making them and not directives by a regulator or other external authority. The second point is the need for international regulatory consistency. Ratings are issued and used globally. A rating produced under one set of regulations may not mean the same thing or address the same risks as one produced under another if those regulations are not compatible. Inconsistent ratings regulation could actually promote uncertainty in the markets at a time when it can be least afforded. In short, the focus should be on promoting consistency and integrity in the ratings process. Many of the steps we have outlined and the measures we have taken are aimed at precisely that goal. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in the hearing. Let me also assure you again of our commitment to analytical excellence and our desire to continue to work with Congress and all governments worldwide. I would be happy to answer any questions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Before I introduce Mr. Curry, I must excuse myself and Senator Akaka will take the gavel and kind of conclude the hearing. Thank you, Senator Akaka. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Curry","Thank you, Senator Reed. Thank you, Senator Akaka. Good afternoon. My name is Dan Curry and I am the President of DBRS, Inc. I am pleased to have the opportunity to present DBRS's views on the regulation of credit rating agencies and investor protection, but first, I would like to give you some background on our firm. DBRS is a Toronto-based credit rating agency established in 1976 and still owned by its founders. With a U.S. affiliate located in New York and Chicago, DBRS is a full-service rating agency that maintains ratings on more than 43,000 securities in 35 countries. DBRS is committed to ensuring the objectivity and integrity of its ratings and the transparency of its operations. DBRS was designated as an NRSRO in 2003, the first non-U.S.-based rating agency to attain that designation. DBRS is now registered under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, which Congress passed in Now I would like to turn my attention to the important issue of competition. It is no secret that the credit rating industry in the United States is dominated by three large agencies. The market you see today was fostered by a regulatory system that gave special treatment to NRSRO credit ratings, yet made the process of attaining that designation opaque and hard to navigate. Although the Credit Rating Agency Act has made more competition possible, the actual competitive landscape has been slow to change. We believe that the continued dominance of the three largest rating agencies contributed to the recent turmoil in the structured finance market when changes in the assumptions underlying their rating models led to rapid and dramatic rating downgrades. As the markets struggle to regain their footing, more needs to be done to open this industry to competition. Although the government can be a catalyst for change, the opposite seems to be occurring. Recognizing that the securitization markets have ceased to function, the Federal Reserve has created the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF. In order to be eligible for this program, the security must receive a AAA rating from Standard and Poor's, Moody's, or Fitch, which the Fed calls ``major'' NRSROs. The result of this approach is that DBRS, with over 30 years of experience as a rating agency and more than six as an NRSRO, is unable to rate TALF-eligible securities, even though several issuers have asked it to do so. For the foreseeable future, the TALF is likely to be the entire securitization market in the United States. Therefore, by excluding all but the three largest rating agencies from this program, the government may be further entrenching the historic oligopoly for years to come. The long-term efficiency of the capital markets requires that rating agencies be allowed to compete on the quality of their work, not their size or their legacy. DBRS urges Congress to take whatever steps are necessary to make the Rating Agency Act's promise of competition a reality. The next issue I would like to address is that of uniform regulation. Ensuring that NRSRO regulation treats all business models equally is critical to investor protection. This is especially true in the area of ratings transparency. There has been much debate about the relative accuracy of ratings determined under the issuer-pay model and subscriber-pay model. This debate cannot be resolved so long as investors and other market participants are unable to verify the accuracy claims made by subscriber-based ratings providers. Anecdotal discussions by these firms of where they got it right are no substitute for an objective, independent analysis of the universe of their ratings. DBRS urges policymakers and regulators to recognize the importance of transparency for all rating agencies. Finally, I would like to address the need for stable regulation. DBRS sees no need to abandon the regulatory regime established under the Rating Agency Act because this regime is barely 18 months old and no superior alternative has been identified. Moreover, DBRS sees no benefit in transferring jurisdiction over rating agencies from the SEC, which has overseen this area for 34 years, to a regulator that has no experience. Interposing a self-regulatory body between rating agencies and the SEC would be the worst idea of all, since this would lead to a duplicative regulation by a costly private bureaucracy that may or may not know anything about the industry. A better approach would be to ensure that the SEC has the necessary resources to effectively examine NRSROs and to enforce the existing laws and rules. My written statement addresses some additional issues. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you. Senator Akaka . Thank you very much, Mr. Curry. I want to thank all of you for your patience and also to tell you that your full statements will be placed in the record. I would like to ask my first question to one who has been an advocate, one that I have been with before, and I want to ask Ms. Roper as an advocate, as an independent entity within the Internal Revenue Service, the National Taxpayer Advocate has evolved into an essential organization that has protected and assisted taxpayers. I have highly valued the dedicated efforts of the National Taxpayer Advocate and Ms. Nina Olson and her staff. Using the Taxpayer Advocate organization as a model and creating an Investor Advocate at the Securities and Exchange Commission has the potential to be an extremely valuable addition to assist and protect taxpayers. So my question to you is, what is your evaluation of creating an Investor Advocate at the SEC?","Statement","STATEMENT OF DANIEL CURRY, PRESIDENT, DBRS, INC."
"Ms. Roper","Thank you, Senator. Ideally, it would be superfluous to have an Investor Advocate at the SEC. The SEC portrays itself as the investor advocate. My experience working on these issues as an external investor advocate for over 20 years now is that there are many times when we would have benefited from having an advocate on the inside to carry investors' case. I can see several different areas where I think this would be particularly useful. As investor advocates, we have often been frustrated that our view is not addressed in the agency policymaking from the outset, that it is something that ends up being incorporated, at best, later during the comment period, often with very little effect. Having an internal advocate who could ensure that investors' views are integrated into the rulemaking process, conduct research outreach, I think would be extraordinarily useful.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Also, Ms. Roper, we share an interest in protecting mutual fund investors. Mutual funds are what average investors rely on in their retirement, savings for their children's college education, as well, and other financial goals and their dreams. I have advocated for strengthening the independence of mutual fund boards and improving relevant and meaningful disclosures for investors' transparency. My question to you is, what must be done to better protect and inform mutual fund investors?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Roper","Thank you again, Senator. As you know, we have endorsed your legislation on mutual fund and share those goals. And I very much look forward to a time when our primary priorities are helping average retail investors make better informed decisions and have better protection in the marketplace. That hasn't been at the top of our agenda with the global economy in crisis. But I think--and because the damage that has been done to investors has been sort of done indirectly through the failure of a system as a whole. There was a robust mutual fund reform agenda that was put on the table at the SEC in the wake of the mutual fund trading scandals and then was allowed to sort of fall by the wayside. I think it would be extraordinarily useful to bring back some of the ideas that were under discussion at that time, including better point of recommendation disclosures, independence governance, as you have suggested, and not just limited to mutual funds, but the entire issue of broker-dealer compensation and how that creates a set of incentives that operate against investor interest, I think, are extraordinarily important issues that it would be nice to be able to get back to at some point in the near future.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you for your responses. I would like to ask the next question to Mr. Richard Ketchum. Our modern complex economy depends on the ability of the consumers to make informed financial decisions, and as you know, we have been supporting trying to move financial literacy in our country. Without sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, individuals will not be able to appropriately evaluate credit opportunities, successfully invest for long-term financial goals, or be able to manage difficult financial situations. My question to you is, what must be done to ensure that investors have the knowledge and skills necessary to make informed investment decisions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ketchum","Well, thank you, Senator. It is a great question.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Before you do that, let me say that FINRA has been doing a good job already, and I know that. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ketchum","Well, I appreciate that. As you know, the FINRA Investor Education Foundation is the largest foundation solely focused on investor education, and given that we both feel good about the progress we have made and recognize the enormity of the task, we have tried to, as best we can, both through placing a rich series of informative efforts on our Web site at finra.org and efforts to try to attract investors to look at those various different pieces of information, efforts to identify everything from questions to ask with respect to complex products to things to be concerned about with respect to potential scams, as well working very closely with some of the most vulnerable constituencies, particularly from the standpoint of our seniors, our military, et cetera. I think the only answer with respect to investor education is to keep on going on with more and more resources and more and more cooperation between enterprises that have constituencies and concern with respect to this area. And you are right. It can't just be with respect to investors that exist today. It has to be a strong effort from the standpoint of our schools, as well. But we are very much committed to be part of that process. It is something that deserves more attention from a governmental standpoint and more attention across any of us that cares deeply about the quality of our securities markets.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much for that. I want to pose this next question to a person that I knew in the House, Representative Baker. I think you left there, or you were there when I left there, in the House and moved to the Senate. But it is good to see you again.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baker","Thank you, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Chairman Breeden said, and I am quoting, ``The disasters we have seen did not arise due to lack of resources for the Federal Reserve, the SEC, or any other agencies that did not perform as well as needed to do, or because of outdated laws from the 1930s.'' The banking and securities regulators generally had tools to address the abuse of practices but did not use their powers forcefully enough or ask for new authority promptly when they needed it. My question to you, how would you recommend addressing this problem so that the regulators will be more effective in the future?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baker","Thank you, Senator. It is a tremendously difficult question in that if you would go back in time, perhaps 24 months, and look at market conditions and the tremendous profitability that had existed for some number of years, and the expectation by many that it would continue into the foreseeable future, there was at the same time columns of regulatory authority that were constructed. Within each column, there may have been particular skill sets which could have been deployed, but because of the lack of information flows between those columns, complex instruments were created that did not fit neatly within a column and remained outside the transparency required for someone to make an informed decision. I would say that there were people in the market who exercised analytical skills and who did, in fact, predict that some of these very unfortunate circumstances possibly would occur. They, for the most part, were in the private sector, who were skilled analysts looking at the financial bubble that was growing in significant size. How we could construct a new systemic regulatory structure and enable a single person to be able to see the entire view of the market and come to an appropriate and timely decision would probably be almost impossible. Having an organization of some sort--there has been discussion this morning as to concerns about the SEC, the Federal Reserve, the existing entities. But I think we should be cognizant of the fact that none of those entities had access to the level of transparency that would have enabled them to make that collective, almost omniscient, insight into the coming storm. So I believe that, as we suggested in our testimony, the construction of a regulatory entity--I have been very careful not to say a particular agency--that has access to market information in a timely manner, while at the same time protecting the privacy of that disclosure by the registered entity, would perhaps--I am not sure it would guarantee--enable that entity to be able to take steps early on and perhaps limit the scale and scope of damage. Certainly, we would like to be a participant in that discussion going forward. We have specific ideas at the appropriate time that may be appropriate to consider. But we recognize that it is a very difficult problem. I am glad you are where you are, Senator, and I am glad I do not have that decision any longer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much, Representative Baker. I want to direct my next question to Mr. Stack. In our last hearing on securities regulation, Thomas Doe, a former member of your board, stated, and I am quoting, that ``the 34-year era of the municipal industry self-regulation must come to an end.'' In advocating this position, Mr. Doe emphasized that MSRB structure, two-thirds of which is comprised of either bank dealers or securities dealers, has led to a situation of industry capture, where the issuers and other writers are then responsible for regulating their own conduct. What is your evaluation of these comments?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stack","Senator, I take extreme exception to Thomas Doe's comments. I believe that the MSRB, which was the first SRO upgrade in 1975, has worked extraordinarily well. The measure of an SRO, such as the MSRB, is, first, do we protect investors? How we do that is through our ability to ensure immediate and clear disclosure to both retail, institutional, small and large investors. We have established a new electronic system on the Web to ensure up-to-date investor information. We also regulate, up to the extent that the statute allows, very clearly all of the municipal dealers and brokers in very strong terms. For example, we are the only group that prohibits a pay to play; that is, that you cannot do municipal securities financings with an issuer if you contribute to somebody running for office who is an official of that issuer. No one else has done that. Interestingly enough, because we are an SRO, we can do something even tougher than what we call our parent body, the SEC, because we have the ability to set very, very strong rules. Another thing I would like to say is that all of our rules governing our brokers and their dealers are sent out for comment to the public, to investors, to everybody around, and then we present our proposed rules to the SEC. So it is not that we are off in the ether land, just kind of somewhere out there making our own rules for brokers. All of our rules go to the SEC for review, and the SEC decides whether or not to approve them. Finally, some of the problems I mentioned in my testimony that we have encountered are that there are many participants in our market who right now are unregulated: financial advisors, swap advisors, investment advisors. They are not registered with the SEC, and we have no power to regulate them. We have written the House Committee and have written your Committee and asked for the ability--asked for Federal regulation of these groups in order that they can have professional standards, in order that they can meet the kind of stringent requirements that we have for brokers and dealers, including and specifically pay to play. We think if we can regulate those participants, that the market will operate well. In conclusion, we believe the SRO system does work well and it is a way of using the expertise of the market participants to come up with rules to govern it. I have read the Senate Committee report when the MSRB was set up in 1975, and that was the Committee's intent. These rules, as I say, can be tougher, and then those rules are submitted to the SEC. And the SEC then approves whether or not those rules go into effect. So we think that the SRO is actually a very tough way to organize and to supervise dealers. The SEC is not limited, but it sticks pretty much to antifraud issues. We can go much further and pay to play is a perfect example of where we have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Well, I thank you so much for that. You know of it personally. I would rather that we not craft laws just to try to deal with these. In this particular case, the MSRB should just move--as you said, what you mentioned, I wish we could do at this time. But thank you so much for your comments on that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stack","Thank you, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Let me direct the next question to Mr. Tittsworth, and is Chanos or Chanos?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Chanos","Chanos, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Chanos. Thank you. And I am looking for an important recommendation, so I would like to hear from both of you. Which is one recommendation that you feel is the most important legislative or regulatory initiative that this Committee must undertake in the modernization of financial market regulation?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tittsworth","I will take it very quickly, Senator. As I said at the top of our testimony, it is closing what I would call true regulatory gaps, not the perceived regulatory gap that some have talked about between investment advisers and broker-dealers, which is totally nonexistent. True regulatory gaps. And by that, I mean products or services that are unregulated and are outside the regulatory system. And the two I mentioned are hedge fund managers and credit default swaps and derivatives.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much. Any other comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Chanos","Senator, I would use my answer to just point out our overriding viewpoint on regulation, current and future. And that is that the current and expected regulatory framework regulates and examines the activities, not the actors. That is, they focus on that which is going on in the marketplace across different corporate and private and public investment lines, and not just be hamstrung, for example, for the Fed to look at bank holding companies; the SEC to look at securities firms. We need to really focus on how our markets have changed down through the years and have morphed beyond the view of the 33 and 34 and 40 acts, and come up with smart regulation as someone said earlier, not necessarily more regulation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much. I wanted to be certain that we would offer every one of you a chance to make comments, so let me direct this question to Ms. Bolger and Mr. Curry. The Wall Street Journal reported that despite the failure of ratings agencies' models during this financial crisis, Moody's, S&P and Fitch have ``made few fundamental changes to the way they assess debt.'' Please tell us what you think went wrong in your original assessment of these assets and why we should trust your agencies to rate these same assets again, now that taxpayer money is at risk.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bolger","Thank you, Senator. And, actually, before answering, I would respectfully request that the white paper on regulation, I mentioned it in my remarks, that that be placed in the record. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bolger","I think certainly in terms of some of the ratings and structured finance, just stepping back, we have almost a hundred year history of rating a tremendous amount of securities and a very good track record. But in connection with some of those securities, I think the performance that we have seen, that the market has seen, has not been consistent with that historical track record. Some of the assumptions that we use simply were not borne out. However, we have stepped back. We have taken a very serious look at our processes and we have made a number of changes, changes both that have been required in connection with two, now two--and, actually, today is the conclusion of a final draft period for SEC rulemaking, so we have made changes in connection with their requirements. We have also made some changes on our own initiative. And we think moving forward, it is important, again, picking up on the theme of smart regulation, that we focus on regulation that preserves our analytical independence and also that is globally consistent in connection with some of these actions we have taken.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Curry","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Curry","Thank you, Senator. I think that the root of the problem in the structured securities was the reliance on the decisions of just a few people using models to determine these ratings. At the same time, the securities became so complex that investors were really unable to exercise enough judgment around the risks that they were taking. And we are going through the flip side of that process, I think, right now, where there are some very substantial changes to assumptions, again, in these models made by a few people, that lead to massive rating downgrades, but still a lack of understanding of fundamentally what is behind this analysis. Given that the current Rating Agency Reform Act does not extend to the substance of ratings, I think that transparency becomes very critical, and that is going to be a big challenge in how that is managed. I still do not think that the transparency is adequate and I worry that a lot of the changes that have taken place are more administrative and do not really prevent us from ending up in this same situation again seven or 8 years down the road.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much, Mr. Curry. Without question, all of you have been very helpful to the Committee. We are looking forward to improve whatever needs that in our Nation. I want to thank all the witnesses for being here. And I want you to know that we appreciate the significant time that you witnesses have spent with us today. This hearing record compiled today will, without question, help us develop policies to better protect investors and improve the regulation of the securities market. We look forward to continuing to hear from you, and with much hope, we are looking at an improvement in our Nation's crisis that we are in at this time. This hearing record will remain open for a week for Members to submit any additional statements or questions that they may have. Again, thank you very much, and this hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
