"Chairman Reed","The Committee will come to order. I want to welcome everyone and particularly thank our witnesses for making themselves available today. This hearing will examine a key activity within our financial markets--the securitization of mortgages and other assets--and will build on previous hearings this Subcommittee has held to address various aspects of regulatory modernization, including hedge funds, derivatives, corporate governance, SEC enforcement, and risk management at large financial institutions. Securitization is the packaging of individual loans or other debt instruments into marketable securities to be purchased by investors. At its core this process helps free lenders to make more loans available for families to purchase items like homes and cars and for small businesses to thrive. But we have learned from the financial crisis that securitization or how it is conducted can also be extremely harmful to the financial markets and families without appropriate diligence and oversight. Arguably, many of the basic requirements needed for effective securitization were not met over the course of the last several years. Today's panel will discuss how in recent years the securitization process created incentives throughout the chain of participants to emphasize loan volume over loan quality, contributing to the buildup and collapse of the subprime mortgage market and the broader economy. Today we find ourselves in the opposite position from a few years back with hardly any issuances in key markets that could help return lending to responsible levels. So this afternoon's hearing is about how to strengthen the securitization markets and enact any needed changes to ensure that securitization can be used in ways that expand credit without harming consumers and the capital markets. I have asked today's witnesses to address a number of key issues, including the role securitization played in the financial crisis, the current conditions of these markets, and what changes may be needed for Federal oversight of the securitization process. Unfortunately, a number of the banks who issue these securities could not find anyone in their workforce who was willing to testify today, but we are lucky to have experts here, both academic and business experts. I welcome you all and look forward to your testimony. Let me now turn it over to Senator Bunning for his remarks.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. All it takes is a short amount of time studying the market for asset-backed securities to realize really how complicated it is. Right now there is no basic private securitization market, especially for mortgages. I hope this hearing will help us all get a better understanding of the market and what we can do and should be done to make it work better. In theory, securitization is a great idea that brings more capital to the financial markets, leading to more loans for individuals and businesses. Done properly, that is a good thing. But as we saw last year, if it is done wrong, it can lead to disaster. The natural first question is whether the problems we saw were a result of a bad theory or bad execution. For several reasons, I think what happened was bad execution as a result of other bad policies and regulations. Probably the biggest factor that led to the problems in the securitization market were artificial demand created by bank capital rules favoring highly rated securities over whole loans. That artificial demand found a home in residential mortgage securities thanks to the GSEs' loose underwriting and easy money. And the rating agencies enabled it all. We should start by fixing those problems. Once the bad incentives and artificial demand are taken away, real risk analysis can be done, and price can be based on real value. The Government will not have to solve all the problems because investors will demand more protections from the issuers. For example, the model where issuers were paid by the number of deals closed and loan originators passed on all responsibility and collects profits up front will not be tolerated by investors in the future. That will lead to a solution tailored to a particular asset and flexible enough to be changed as the market evolves. I hope our witnesses will comment on these ideas and provide some of their own, because we really need them. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING

"Ms. McCoy","Thank you. Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today. In the run-up to the crisis, Wall Street financed over half of subprime mortgages through private label securitization. When defaults spiked on those loans and housing prices fell, securitization collapsed in August 2007. It has been on life support ever since. When private label securitization comes back, it is critical to put it on sound footing so that it does not bring down the financial system again. The private label system had basic flaws that fueled the crisis. First, under the originate-to-distribute model, lenders made loans for immediate sale to investors. In addition, lenders made their money on up-front fees. Both features encouraged lenders to ``pass the trash.'' Lenders cared less about underwriting because they knew that investors would bear the brunt if the loans went belly up. In addition, to boost volume and fees, lenders made loans to weaker and weaker borrowers. In fact, when I have examined the internal records of some of the largest nonprime lenders in the United States, I have often found two sets of underwriting standards: lower standards for securitized loans and higher ones for loans held in portfolio. Second, securitizations spread contagion by allowing the same bad loan to serve as collateral for a mortgage-backed security, a collateralized debt obligation, and even the CDO of CDOs. It further spread contagion because investors used tainted subprime bonds as collateral for other types of credit, such as commercial paper and interbank loans. This shook confidence in the entire financial system because investors did not know where the toxic assets were located. Last, securitization resulted in a servicing system that creates thorny barriers to constructive workouts of distressed loans. We have had too many foreclosures as a result. In this, there were three victims: borrowers, who were steered into bafflingly risky mortgages, often at inflated interest rates; investors, who were forced to rely on ratings because securities disclosures were deficient and securitizations were so complex; and, finally, the public, who had to pay to clean up the mess. So how do we fix these problems going forward? There are two aspects: lax underwriting and loan workouts. First, fixing underwriting. One group of proposals seeks to realign incentives indirectly so that mortgage actors do careful underwriting. These include requiring securitizers to retain risk, higher capital requirements, better compensation methods, and stronger representations and warranties along with stiff recourse. I applaud these measures, but they are not enough to ensure good underwriting. I doubt, for example, whether prohibiting issuers from hedging their retained risk is really enforceable. Banks are adept at evading capital standards, and the Basel II standards are badly frayed. And stronger reps and warranties are only as good as the issuer's solvency. Consider the fact that most nonbank subprime lenders are out of business and 128 banks and thrifts have failed since the crisis began. Another group of proposals focuses on better due diligence by investors and rating agency reform. This, too, is badly needed. However, memories of this crisis eventually will grow dim. When that happens, query whether investors will really take the time to do careful due diligence when a high-yield investment is dangled out in front of them. For these reasons, we need to finish the work the Federal Reserve Board began last year and adopt uniform Federal underwriting standards for mortgages that apply to all mortgage actors across the board. A brand-new study by researchers at UNC-Chapel Hill just found that States with similar laws had lower foreclosure rates than States without those laws. And a 2008 study found that State assignee liability laws did not reduce access to credit. Then one last thought: facilitating loan workouts. Here I propose amending Federal tax laws to tax securitized trusts unless they provide ironclad incentives to do loan workouts when cost effective. Thank you, and I welcome any questions.",Statement,PROFESSOR OF LAW, AND DIRECTOR, INSURANCE LAW CENTER, UNIVERSITY OF CONNECTICUT SCHOOL OF LAW 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Professor. Mr. Miller, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, Members of the Subcommittee, on behalf of the American Securitization Forum, I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. Securitization plays an essential role in the financial system and the broader U.S. economy. It is a mainstream source of credit and financing for individuals and businesses and finances a substantial portion of all consumer credit. Currently there is over $12 trillion of outstanding securitized assets, including mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, and asset-backed commercial paper. The size and scope of securitization activities reflects the benefits and value it has historically delivered to the financial system and economy. Restoration of greater function and confidence to this market is a particularly urgent need today, in light of capital and liquidity constraints currently confronting financial institutions and markets. With the process of bank de-leveraging and balance sheet reduction still underway, and with increased bank capital requirements on the horizon, it is clear that the credit and funding capacity provided by securitization cannot be replaced by deposit-based financing or other alternatives. Simply put, the recovery and restoration of confidence in securitization is a necessary ingredient for economic growth to resume and for that growth to continue on a sustained basis into the future. The U.S. securitization markets experienced substantial dislocation during the ongoing financial market turmoil. While there are signs of recovery in certain market sectors, others-- most notably, private residential mortgage-backed securities-- remain dormant, with other asset classes remaining significantly challenged. Although tightened lending standards are one important reason for a broader constriction in the supply of credit, the impairment and reduction in securitization activity plays an equal, if not more important role. Certain Government programs, including direct support for Government-guaranteed mortgage securitization and the TALF program for certain asset-backed securities, have been successful in supporting financing and the liquidity needs in part of this market. However, these programs are temporary, and a larger challenge remains to create a stable and sustainable private capital market platform for future securitization activity. To accomplish this essential goal, a number of weaknesses and deficiencies of securitization revealed by the financial market crisis must be addressed. ASF and the broader industry are working actively to pursue and implement certain critical reforms, and we will continue to work constructively with policymakers on others. I would like to offer several overriding perspectives on these reform measures. First, many of the problems that have been identified are not inherent in securitization per se. Instead, they relate to the manner in which securitization was used. As a general rule, the amount of risk inherent in a securitization transaction is equal to the risk that is embedded in the securitized assets themselves. However, ancillary practices and strategies, such as the excessive use of leverage and undue reliance on short- term funding for long-term liabilities, poor credit underwriting, or the absence of effective risk management controls, can amplify and concentrate these risks. This does not, however, mean that securitization itself is inherently flawed. Second, any reform measures should be targeted carefully to address specific and clearly identified deficiencies. Equal care should be taken to consider the individual and combined effects of various policy reforms to ensure that they do not inadvertently stifle otherwise sound and desirable securitization activity. We are very concerned that some reform measures currently being pursued or under consideration--most particularly, the combined effect of accounting standards changes and proposed regulatory capital rules--are counterproductive policy responses that are not reasonably targeted to address identified problems. Such reforms may render it prohibitively expensive to securitize a wide range of consumer and business assets. In turn, this could blunt the ability of the financial system to originate and fund consumer and business credit demand that finances jobs and investments, just as the broader economy begins to recover. We believe that this is an important matter that would benefit from Congress's further attention. Finally, from an industry perspective, ASF is focused primarily on devising and implementing concrete steps to improve the basic securitization market infrastructure in response to specific deficiencies identified in preexisting practices. Grouped broadly under the heading of ``Project Restart,'' these reforms will substantially improve and standardize information and data that is captured and reported to investors in securitized products, including, in the case of residential mortgage-backed securities, extensive and detailed loan level data. With these data enhancements broadly in place, securitization risks will be more transparent and capable of evaluation by investors and other market participants. At the same time, these data and standardization improvements will support higher-quality rating agency, due diligence, quality assurance, valuation, and other processes that depend on accurate and reliable underlying data. And, finally, and briefly, another important goal of Project Restart is to enhance and standardize representations and warranties that originators of mortgage loans typically provide. Much like a defective product is returned to a store from which it was sold, a mortgage loan that does not meet specified underwriting criteria should be returned to the originator through its removal from a securitization trust for cash. We believe that more effective representations and warranties will result in a full retention of economic risk by originators of defective loans consistent with the policy goal of requiring those who originate assets for securitization to retain a meaningful and continuing economic stake in the quality of those loans. I thank the Subcommittee for the opportunity to testify today.",Statement,STATEMENT OF GEORGE P. MILLER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, AMERICAN SECURITIZATION FORUM 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. Mr. Davidson, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","Good afternoon, Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, Members of the Subcommittee. More than 2 years since the collapse of the Bear Stearns high-grade structured credit enhanced leverage fund, its name a virtual litany of woes, we are still in the midst of a wrenching economic crisis, brought on at least in part by the flawed structure of our securitization markets. I appreciate the opportunity to share my views on what regulatory and legislative actions could reduce the risk of such a future crisis. I believe that securitization contributed to the current economic crisis in two ways: First, poor underwriting led to unsustainably low mortgage payments and excessive leverage, especially in the subprime and Alt-A markets. This in turn contributed to the bubble and subsequent house price drop. Second, the complexity and obfuscation of some structured products such as collateralized debt obligations caused massive losses and created uncertainty about the viability of key financial institutions. Now to solutions. Boiled down to the essentials, I believe that for the securitization market to work effectively, bondholders must ensure that there is sufficient capital ahead of them to bear the first loss risks of underlying assets; that the information provided to them is correct; that the rights granted to them in securitization contracts are enforceable; that they fully understand the investment structures; and that any remaining risks they bear are within acceptable bounds. If these conditions are not met, investors should refrain from participating in these markets. If bondholders act responsibly, leverage will be limited and capital providers will be more motivated to manage and monitor risks. If this is the obligation of investors, what then should be the role of Government? First, Government should encourage all investors and mandate that regulated investors exercise appropriate caution and diligence. To achieve this goal, regulators should reduce or eliminate their reliance on ratings. As an alternative to ratings, I believe regulators should place greater emphasis or reliance on analytical measures of risk, such as computations of expected loss and portfolio stress tests. Second, Government should promote standardization and transparency in securitization markets. While the SEC, the ASF, and the rating agencies may all have a role in this process, I believe that transforming Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac into member-owned securitization utilities would be the best way to achieve this goal. Third, Government can help eliminate fraud and misrepresentation. Licensing and bonding of mortgage brokers and lenders, along with establishing a clear mechanism for enforcing the rights of borrowers and investors for violations of legal and contractual obligations, would be beneficial to the securitization market. However, I believe that there are superior alternatives to the Administration's recommendation of retention of 5 percent of credit risk to achieve this goal. I would recommend an origination certificate that provides a direct guarantee of the obligations of the originator to the investors and the obligation of the originator to the borrowers coupled with penalties for violations even in good markets and requires evidence of financial backing. This would be a more effective solution. If the flaws that led to the current crisis are addressed by Government and by industry, securitization can once again make valuable contributions to our economy. I look forward to your questions. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ANDREW DAVIDSON, PRESIDENT, ANDREW DAVIDSON AND COMPANY 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Mr. Davidson. Mr. Hoeffel, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Thank you. I am testifying today on behalf of the Commercial Mortgage Securities Association. CMSA represents the collective voice of all market participants in the commercial real estate capital market finance industry, including lenders, issuers, investors, rating agencies, and servicers, among others. These participants come together to facilitate a transparent primary and secondary market for commercial mortgages. I am also an investor in CMBS, but I have more than two decades of experience as a commercial lender and a CMBS issuer. I would like to thank the Committee for the opportunity to share our views on securitization, which is crucial to borrower access to credit and our overall economy. This afternoon, I will focus specifically on securitized credit markets for commercial real estate, focusing on three issues: first, the enormous challenges facing the $3.5 trillion market for commercial real estate finance, of which about $850 billion is securitized; second, the unique structure of CMBS and the need to customized regulatory reforms accordingly to support recovery; and, finally, the need to restore the CMBS market to meet significant borrower demand. Today the commercial real estate market is facing a perfect storm based on three interconnected and pressing challenges. First, there is no liquidity or lending. In 2007, there were approximately $240 billion in CMBS loans made, approximately half of the total real estate lending market. CMBS issuance fell to only $12 billion in 2008, despite strong credit performance at the time and high borrower demand. It has now been well over a year since a new CMBS deal has been done. Second, there are significant loan maturities through 2010. In fact, hundreds of billions of dollars is coming due in the next 2 years. Capital refinance these loans is largely unavailable, and loan extensions are difficult to achieve. Third, the downturn in the U.S. economy persists. Commercial real estate is greatly impacted by the macroeconomic factors: high unemployment, low consumer confidence, poor business performance, and falling property values. This last point is especially important to highlight. Remember, commercial real estate did not cause the current liquidity crisis. It has been negatively affected by it now, 2 years into the crisis. Second, even within the commercial real estate finance industry, CMBS or securitization did not cause stress. In fact, nonsecuritized loans are now underperforming CMBS and are experiencing in some cases greater defaults. Ironically, securitization may be ultimately an exit strategy for these troubled loans. As financial policymakers, including the current and previous Administration, have rightfully pointed out, no recovery plan will be successful unless it helps restart the securitization markets. The IMF also asserts that securitization will assist withdrawal of Government interventions, employing private capital to fuel private lending. Today many recovery efforts in the commercial real estate market, such as TALF and PPIP, have been helpful. But they are in a nascent and delicate stage, as discussed in my written testimony. So it is important that regulatory reforms, including accounting changes, as George mentioned, must work to strengthen the securitized markets and to give private investors who bring their own capital to the table certainty you and confidence. Above all, in the commercial real estate context, there is a real concern that some of the reform proposals will be applied in a one-size-fits-all manner that could actually impede recovery. Specifically, there are a number of important distinctions between CMBS and other asset-based securities markets, and the upshot of these distinctions is that they help the CMBS market avoid problems of poor underwriting or inadequate transparency. These significant differences are in four major areas: First, the borrower. In CMBS, the borrower in most cases is a sophisticated business within income-producing property and contractual revenues from tenants as opposed to some situations in the subprime residential mortgage where a loan may have been underwritten for a borrower who could not document his income. Second, the structure of CMBS. There are only about 100 to 300 loans in a typical CMBS deal as opposed to thousands of loans in residential deals. This enables greater due diligence and analysis to be performed on CMBS pools by several different parties, including rating agencies and investors. Third, the existence of a third-party investor or B-piece buyer in the securitization process. Unlike other asset classes, CMBS has an investor who purchases a first loss position and conducts extensive due diligence as a result, which includes sit visits to every property. This investor also re-underwrites proposed loans in a potential pool, and they can negotiate to kick out any loans in which they do not wish to invest. Finally, greater transparency. CMBS market participants have significant access to loan, property, and bond level information at issuance and on an ongoing basis. In fact, the CMSA investor reporting package is used as a model for transparencies by other types of ABS markets. It is from this unique perspective that we approach regulatory reform proposals that will undoubtedly change the CMBS market. We do not necessarily oppose some of these proposals despite the fact that they will address practices that were typical in the subprime and residential securitization markets, not CMBS. Instead, we ask that policymakers ensure that such reforms are tailored to address the specific needs of each securitization asset class and to recognize the many safeguards that already exist in the CMBS market today. In this regard, two aspects of regulatory reform are of utmost interest to CMSA: a requirement that securitizers--that is, bond issuers and underwriters--retain at least 5 percent of the credit risk in any securitized loan pool; and a restriction of the ability of issuers to protect against or hedge this 5- percent retained risk. As is explained in more detail in my written testimony, the basic concern we have about both of these proposals is whether they will be applied in a one-size-fits-all manner. While we agree that it is important for the appropriate parties to keep skin in the game, CMBS deals are already structured to do this in a way that has worked well for the market and for the overall economy for years and can continue to serve the policy objective that is sought here. As discussed earlier, first loss buyers conduct their own extensive credit analysis on the loans, examining detailed information concerning every property before buying the highest-risk bonds in the CMBS securitization. If these reforms are not applied in a tailored fashion, the danger is that the reforms will end up hampering the ability of CMBS lenders to originate new loans, thereby limiting capital and the flow of credit at a time when our economy desperately needs it. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF J. CHRISTOPHER HOEFFEL, EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE MEMBER, COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE SECURITIES ASSOCIATION 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. Dr. Irving, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Irving","Good afternoon, Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to participate in today's panel. I have a very simple three-part message that I want to convey today. First, securitization can be a very effective mechanism for channeling capital into our economy to benefit the consumer and commercial sectors. Second, as a result of the financial crisis, the residential mortgage-backed security market and the asset- backed market are sharply bifurcated. As I will describe, some are performing well, some less so. And then, finally, third, there are four broad areas of reform worthy of pursuit to help the securitized markets function better. In my remaining time, I will elaborate on these three points. One of the most important benefits of the securitization process is that it provides loan originators an additional funding source as an alternative to conventional retail deposits. As an example, I manage the Fidelity Ginnie Mae Fund, which has doubled in size in the past year to over $7 billion in assets. The mortgage-backed security market effectively brings together shareholders in this Ginnie Mae Fund with individuals all over the country who want to purchase a home or refinance a mortgage. In this manner, securitization breaks down geographic barriers between lenders and borrowers, thereby improving the availability and cost of credit across regions. Second, to provide further insight into the value of securitization, consider what happened to the consumer ABS sector. From 2005 through 2007, auto and credit card ABS issuance was roughly $170 billion per year. However, after the collapse of Lehman Brothers in September of 2008, new issuance came to a virtual halt. As a result, the interest rate on new car loans provided by finance companies increased by about 5 percentage points between July of 2008 and year end. Issuance did not resume until March of this year, when the TALF program began. Thanks to TALF, between March and September, there was $91 billion of card and auto ABS issuance. Coincident with the resumption of a functioning auto ABS market, new car financing fell back into the 3 percent range. I will now turn to the agency mortgage market, which is also performing well, thanks to the extraordinary Government intervention over the past year. This intervention has had two parts. First, in September of 2008, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were placed into conservatorship, thus reassuring tens of thousands of skittish agency MBS investors that the Government stood behind their investments. Second, the Federal Reserve pledged to purchase $1.25 trillion of agency MBS by the end of 2009. So far, the Fed has purchased just over $900 billion, thus reducing significantly the spread between the yields on agency MBS and Treasuries. As of this week, the conforming balance 30-year fixed mortgage rate is approximately 4.85 percent, which is very close to a generational low. Furthermore, the agency MBS market is deep and liquid. In contrast, the new issued private label mortgage market has received no Government support and has effectively shut down. From 2001 to 2006, issuance in this market had increased almost fourfold, to $1.2 trillion. But when the financial crisis hit, the issuance quickly fell to zero. Virtually the only source of financing for mortgage above the conforming loan limit, so-called ``jumbo loans,'' is a bank loan, and generally the available rates are not that attractive. At first glance, the higher cost of jumbo financing may not seem to be an issue that should concern policymakers. But consider the following. If the cost of jumbo financing puts downward pressure on the price of homes costing, say, $800,000, then quite likely there is going to be downward pressure on the homes costing $700,000 and so forth. So in my opinion, at the same time that policymakers deliberate the future of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, they should consider the future of mortgage finance in all price and credit quality tiers. To help improve the functioning of the securitized markets, I recommend that regulatory and legislative efforts be concentrated in four key areas. First, promote improved disclosure to investors at the initial marketing of transactions as well as during the life of a deal. For example, there should be ample time before a deal is priced for investors to review and analyze a full prospectus, not just a term sheet. Second, strengthen credit underwriting standards in the originating process. One way to support this goal is to discourage up-front realization of issuers' profits. This issue is complex and likely will require specialized rules tailored to each market sector. Third, facilitate greater transparency of the methodology and assumptions used by the rating agencies to determine credit ratings. In particular, there should be a public disclosure of the main assumptions behind rating methodologies and models. Finally, support simpler, more uniform capital structures in securitization deals. This goal may not be readily amenable to legislative action, but should be a focus of industry best practices. Taking such steps to correct the defects of recent securitization practices will restore much-needed confidence to this critical part of our capital markets, thereby providing improved liquidity and capital to foster continued growth in the U.S. economy. Thank you, and I look forward to answering your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF WILLIAM W. IRVING, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIDELITY INVESTMENTS 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Dr. Irving. In fact, I wanted to thank all the witnesses for their not only very insightful, but very concise testimony. I appreciate it very much. All of your written statements will be made a part of the record and any of the statements that my colleagues wish to be submitted will be made part of the record. Let me pose a question to all of you, which in some cases will allow you to elaborate on your initial comments. We have seen a--I am getting to the point now where I can say lifetime, and that is a long time--shift from a very small secondary market for loans to a well-functioning market, now to one that has basically seized up. I think some rough numbers that I have seen, that loans on bank balance sheets, roughly $3.5 trillion, compared to securitization products, about $7.1 trillion, and that market has sort of collapsed. So the issue is how do we--or what are the key factors that are stalling this market and that have to be addressed by us? And again, I think you have alluded to some of them, but let me start with Professor McCoy and go down the row.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Thank you. The problem right now on the investor end is lack of investor trust. Investors were not getting useful disclosures up front. They simply weren't. They weren't given information on the individual loans in the loan package so they could figure out whether the underwriting was good or bad. The due diligence done on those deals by investment banks left a lot to be desired, and in some cases, I fear, was tantamount to fraud to the investors. When I have looked at securitization prospectuses for mortgage-backed securities, often they would say, here are our underwriting standards. But many of the loans in the loan pool were exceptions to these standards, and there is no further description of the exception loans or how many of the loans in the loan pools are exception loans. In some cases, it was more than half, and I guarantee you they did not exceed the underwriting standards. They fell far below. So this is a pig in the poke, and for starters, that needs to be fixed. My additional concern is that investors' interests are not always protective of borrowers. We also need to rebuild securitization so that it does not saddle borrowers unknowingly with products that they cannot afford to repay, and that is a separate issue.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Mr. Miller? Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Senator, I think the reasons are interrelated. There are a number of them. I think I would agree, overall, if I had to characterize it, it would be a significant lack of confidence in various parts of securitization market activity. I think that it certainly relates to withdrawal of confidence from investors who are in parts of the market for the kind of data and data integrity and reliability to give them comfort that they are able to evaluate--make meaningful evaluations of securitized instruments. I think it clearly relates to similar lack of confidence in certain rating agency methods and processes. Having said that, I think it is important to note that while there are clearly parts of the securitization market that are dormant and significantly challenged, there are other parts of the market that are functioning to some reasonable degree of normalcy, and while I think you can also point to Government programs, for example, TALF playing a significant role, TALF has also been beneficial in that it has brought back non-TALF issuance in investors for products that aren't directly supported by Government loans. And I think what that reveals is that it is not something that is endemic to securitization as a whole, but there are specific and identifiable deficiencies that need to be addressed. And so that is why, again, from ASF's perspective, things that lie more perhaps within the industry's control are areas where we are focusing to rebuild the securitization infrastructure, improve the quality, comparability, standardization, and reliability of data, and then finally to-- and I think this goes to some of Andy's comments, which I agree with--to help rebuild confidence in the operational processes and controls so that protective measures that are there to protect investors and ensure that their rights and entitlements as promised are delivered, that those protective measures actually work. And I think there is some significant work and effort that is needed in that area, but all directed at helping to rebuild and restore confidence.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Mr. Davidson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","Addressing the current illiquidity, I would focus sort of on two different areas. One is the area of uncertainty. We still have a tremendous amount of economic uncertainty and regulatory uncertainty, and that just takes some investors out of the market because they need the risks to know a little bit better. And the other area is just the lack of availability of leverage to certain types of instruments. Without leverage, many instruments have to trade at very discounted prices, and so the institutions who hold those now and do have leverage are not willing to transact at the all equity price as opposed to the leveraged price. And I think that is why some of the Government programs, like TALF, have been so effective is because they have reinstituted leverage into these markets. In thinking about the solutions, we have to consider what is the appropriate amount of leverage and make sure that that can be delivered through those markets because that will be an important part of their future success.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Mr. Hoeffel, you can also focus in on the commercial loan--",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Yes. I will definitely have a bent to that. I will look at it from both the investor and the lender point of view, or the originator or issuer point of view. For investors, one of the issues, as Mr. Davidson mentions, is their inability to finance their investments, so that has caused spreads to be very volatile and, in general, trend toward higher spreads than what we had seen when the market was healthier. TALF has certainly helped that from a secondary point of view, some of the existing securities, and may help in some new issues if we get some deals done, but that is yet to be seen. There are certainly concerns about the rating agencies and the rating process, not that they were necessarily wrong, but as I think several people have mentioned, we need greater transparency so investors can understand what the rating process is and delve in and do their own critical analysis of what the ratings mean. And third, from an investor point of view, I think there are concerns about the continuous changes in accounting and regulatory policies. They don't know what the potential ramifications of investing in a security might be down the road because some of the FASB rules keep changing and there is a certain amount of uncertainty there that is unpalatable. From a lender point of view, because, again, of the volatility of credit spreads, in order to make a loan work, you would have to originate it at a pretty high spread today and that is not competitive to the few people that are active in the markets. Some banks and life companies are making new commercial mortgages. Second, there is a big challenge in the commercial real estate space to aggregate collateral. In a healthy market, it takes 3 to 6 months to aggregate sufficient loans to do a securitization. Today's market, it would probably be longer. Typically, lenders would hedge their positions against movement in credit spreads or interest rates during that aggregation period through a number of different derivative options that don't exist right now, or are so uncorrelated to the market that they can't really use them to effectively hedge. So people are unwilling to take the balance sheet risk to aggregate loans solely for securitization. And similarly, lenders or aggregators are concerned about ongoing accounting changes in the market and how that might affect them while they are aggregating, but before they sell.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Dr. Irving, finally.",Speech, 
"Mr. Irving","I will make four comments. First of all, I think uncertainty about home prices and how borrowers behave when they are underwater on their mortgage, when the loan-to- value ratio is greater than 100, has increased the risk premium in the market. And the second facet of uncertainty which is causing skittishness about these securities is just uncertainty about Government policy. The Government in some sense has been in the position inadvertently of picking winners and losers in terms of which investments do well and which do not. Those that get the Government support perform better than those that do not, so it becomes less of an intrinsic relative value of the cash- flows and more an assessment of how the Government policy is going to go. The third would be the equity-like price volatility that we have seen exhibited in many of these marketplaces, again causes there to need to be an increased risk premium, that is, prices go down. And then finally, the complexity. We have sort of a rule of thumb on our trading room floor that for every additional sentence I need to describe to my boss the structure of the security I am buying, the price has to be lower by about a point, and----",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","That would be terrible here.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Dr. Irving. And one point, I think, emerges, and I am going to turn it over to Senator Bunning, is as we proceed forward on financial reform legislation, that will provide one way of at least an additional degree of certainty and calculation of the market, so that might contribute to, in a small way, to expanding this market.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to start on the other side. Without reform of bank capital standards, rating agencies, and housing subsidies like the GSEs, is there any way the private asset-backed security market will ever return?",Speech, 
"Mr. Irving","So first of all, we do have evidence that--from the TALF program for a number of----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","That is Government-backed, though.",Speech, 
"Mr. Irving","No, but where I am going to go with that is that certain high-quality issuers are no longer relying on the TALF program. They can do issuance without the benefit of the Government subsidy. More generally, though, I would say that the past year's experience would suggest that in the residential mortgage market, some sort of a Government guarantee is probably going to be required, and the evidence that I would put forth to that would be if you look at the striking difference between the performance of the agency market, even before the Fannie Mae- Freddie Mac conservatorship, and a nonagency market, where in the nonagency market, even prime jumbo responsible loans with a loan-to-value ratio of 70 were priced at, like, 80 cents on the dollar, there was so much furor in the marketplace and so much concern, that I think that that evidence suggests to me that in times of tremendous stress, at least, there needs to be some sort of a Government backstop. That is not to say necessarily you need to have organizations with large retained portfolios, but some sort of a Government guarantee or credit guarantee, in my opinion.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Another question. Which problems that surfaced in the asset-backed securities markets can be solved by market participants on their own, and which need Government action? All of them, or just some of them?",Speech, 
"Mr. Irving","Well, for instance, I think that in terms of aligning the interests, one of the key principles is to align the interests of the investors and the issuers. For instance, there is the proposal of issuers retaining a 5-percent slice of the security. I would say that that is far too blunt an instrument, and what we need instead is to take a step back and set up an overall regulatory environment and then let that regulator work with a trade organization like ASF to--and CMSA and come up with more detailed rules that are tailored to each particular sector of the market. So, for instance, in that case of aligning the interests of the investors and the issuers, I think that is something that a regulator should do by working closely with the organization to tailor solutions for each individual marketplace. I think maybe one area where legislative could help would be in terms of disclosure in the rating agencies, so we have fuller transparency on their methods and quicker turnaround when there is changing to their methodology or when they discover errors in their process.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Miller, you mentioned that there were about $12 trillion worth of assets. How much would you say of that is near or under water?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Well, from a, I think--and we can look into this and get back to you with specific detail, but the $12 trillion refers to the amount of securitized assets currently outstanding----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","That is correct. I understand that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Right. I think a very small minority of that would be in technical default, so that the securitized instruments are not paying as promised----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","We have approximately five million homeowners that are in foreclosure or are--obviously, their houses are worth less than their mortgages.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Right. And I am distinguishing here--I am speaking at the security level, so the mortgage----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","I understand that, but those securitized mortgages were the things that were sold as AAA rated, and that is where we got into all kind of the devil is in the details. And I find that the rating agencies were right in the middle of all that. In other words, they were the ones that were selling those as AAA quality to not only other banks, but the same banks that had sold them the mortgages in the first place, and all around the world. And that is why when the bubble burst, it didn't just burst here in the United States, it burst in Europe and other places.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","I would certainly agree with that, and to the extent that rating agencies were overly optimistic or miscalculated in terms of their assessment of credit----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Do you think they did due diligence in finding out exactly what kind of mortgages they were securitizing?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","I don't think the rating agencies traditionally have performed due diligence on the underlying mortgages. I do think--I guess the point that I was going to make is that to the extent they did get it wrong, I think, number one, it emphasizes the critical importance of avoiding undue reliance on rating agencies by all parties. And then, second, as I indicated in my earlier testimony, I think one of the core features of reform that will assist issues and problems with the rating agencies and many other issues and deficiencies that we have identified is simply having access to better data that can then support better due diligence, better quality assurance, better rating agency processes in a much more transparent way. I think part of the problem is that judgments made by rating agencies and others were really not easily capable of similar evaluation by others.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Meaning, in other words, being able to distinguish the mortgages that were in the portfolio----",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","----that they were doing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","That is certainly part of it.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Are all of you familiar with the 1994 law that the Congress passed giving the Federal Reserve the jurisdiction over all banks making mortgages and also the mortgage brokers that were making mortgages? They were empowered with oversight--the Federal Reserve was--to see that they were doing their job. In other words, they were watching the store. And it was exactly 14 years from the day that we passed that bill that the first regulation was written, and that was 2 years into Chairman Bernanke's oversight, the first regulations were promulgated on mortgages. So we went 14 years without a regulation. Would someone like to comment on that?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Senator, I am very familiar with that history.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","I am actually writing a book on it.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","I have spoken enough to write a book on it, so----",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","I was on the Consumer Advisory Council for the Federal Reserve from 2002 to 2004. We begged the Federal Reserve to exercise that power. We were aware of the burgeoning problems with the subprime market at that time, and I was privately told by Governor Gramlich that he very much supported that rule, but it would never fly with the Board.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Oh, really?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, it is funny, but the Congress of the United States gave that power to the Federal Reserve and expected them to completely fulfill their obligation in oversight of the mortgage market, whether it be the bank or whether it be the mortgage broker.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","When we would talk to Federal Reserve staff during that time period, we were told that we only had anecdotes to offer, that we could not produce proof of a deleterious effect on the macroeconomy, and that, therefore, the Board would not take action.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, I can tell you when Chairman Greenspan and Chairman Bernanke came before this Banking Committee as a whole, they were all warned about it, especially early in the early 2000s, that we were getting ourselves into a potential bubble situation like we did in the dot-com bubble, and we couldn't get action out of the Federal Reserve. I am just wondering if anybody here was aware of that. No one here was aware that the Fed had that power except the person who was in direct contact with the Federal Reserve?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Bunning.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Since I was in another hearing, I am going to let Senator Gregg go and I will go after him.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Senator Gregg.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","That is very kind of you, Senator. First off, I thought your testimony was exceptional and very, very helpful and constructive, everyone's, and the fact that you were concise and had specific thoughts and ideas as to what we should do is extremely useful. My opening thought, though, however, as I listened to all of you, was does any of this need to be legislated? It sounds to me like almost every specific proposal you have suggested should fall to a regulatory agency to do, and most of it went to underwriting and better underwriting standards, it seemed like. So I would ask anybody on the panel, is there anything here that needs legislation to accomplish it versus just having the proper regulatory agencies noticed that this is the way we should approach these issues?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Senator, if I may, I have jotted down eight different things, and we can divide them between the private market and Government intervention. I think representations and warranties, recourse clauses, standardizing products, and having a functioning resale market for mortgage-backed securities is probably a private sector function, although the Government might convene discussions along those lines. But for Government action----",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","I am talking about Congressional action, not----",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes. Yes. I believe that better disclosures to investors can be handled by the SEC directly and Congress does not need to intervene there. Better underwriting standards, I think, do need Congressional action because the Fed is still not sufficiently aggressive and there is very strong legislation in both chambers along those lines. Higher capital standards, I believe banking regulators will address. Rating agency reform may very well need Congressional attention.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","I would just note that I think if you are going to have a uniform underwriting standard, you don't want that written into law if you want to have flexibility on how--",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes, but I believe----",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","That is going to require some mutation.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","The authorization needs to come from Congress and then delegated, I have proposed, to the new agency.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","You don't think that power already exists within the Fed or----",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Well, the power may exist within the Fed, but the Fed is not exercising it effectively.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","OK. So does anybody else have Congressional action that is required?",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","Senator Gregg, certainly in the area of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which is central to the mortgage- backed securities market----",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","Yes, I accept that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","----Congressional action is necessary. And then that would have a number of spillover effects, depending on how that process went, that may or may not require further Congressional action.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","Does anybody else have anything? You know, this does come down to underwriting. Everybody used that as an example of where the problem lies. Should we move toward a system like the Australians have, where you basically have to put a certain percent down--in Australia, I think it is 20 percent--then you have recourse on mortgages. Or should we continue with the system of the Congress telling everybody in America that they have a right to have a loan to buy a house, no matter whether they can pay it back or not, through the CRA? Or is there someplace in between?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Senator, I don't think you need to regulate underwriting per se. I think you need to make sure that potential investors who might be impacted by the underwriting are fully aware of what they are investing in, so that if the underwriting has been poor, it is not glazed over by a rating or a structure. They have all the information they need to make the proper assessments.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","I would agree. I don't think it is desirable to legislate or regulate underwriting standards per se. I do think it is important, though, for those involved in credit underwriting functions, and I am thinking specifically in the residential mortgage market, for those involved in those activities--mortgage lenders, brokers, and others--to be subject to the same type of regulation so that you have a level playing field and consistent standards that apply to all who are engaged in those functions.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","I am forced to disagree. We saw a situation in which the residential mortgage lending industry was unable to organize self-regulation, and, in fact, engaged in a race to the bottom in lending standards, which was aided and abetted by our fragmented regulatory system which, as Senator Bunning noted, refused to impose strong standards. That is how we got in this mess, and I think the only way that we prevent that from happening is to have some basic common sense standards that apply to all lenders in all States from the Federal Government. To my mind, the most important one is require borrowers to produce documentation that they have the ability to repay the loan at inception. That is common sense. We don't have to obsess about down payment requirements. But that, to me, is essential.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","I don't want to--doesn't that go to recourse? I mean, should there be recourse?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Against the borrower?",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","Right. Should that be a standard that we subscribe to in this country, which we don't now?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Well, some States do subscribe to it. It depends on the State.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","Well, is it a good idea or bad idea?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","I think right now, it is causing people who have already lost their houses to be pushed further into crisis and it is not helping the situation right now.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","And didn't this push to the bottom--wasn't the shove given by the Congress with the CRA and the way it set up Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as basically guaranteed entities?",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Actually, CRA loans have turned out to perform pretty well, and one of the reasons is that banks held them in portfolios so that those higher underwriting standards actually applied to CRA loans. They have been a success story among different classes of loans. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, I agree, they cut their underwriting standards, but they joined the bandwagon late. The private label nonconforming loans created a strong competitive threat that they felt necessary to meet, and so they were not the cause of the problem, although they did join the bandwagon.",Speech, 
"Senator Gregg","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Senator Corker.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I am sorry I missed part of the end of the testimony going to another hearing, but I got the general idea. Focusing on commercial real estate right now, I know there has been a lot of discussion. We were just in New York, lots of people concerned about this huge amount of indebtedness that is coming due, huge amounts of loans done 10 years ago. You had 10-year term, 30-year ARM. In essence, you kind of sold the project at that time because it was almost--you almost got full value because underwriting was so loose, so you kind of wondered, what is the problem? These have got to roll over, and the developer kind of sold the deal on the front end. But I guess as we--and I know that is not the case in every case. But what is the key? Some organization that wants to begin originating commercial real estate loans again and securitizing them from just doing those things and market needs to make those be sold by keeping recourse or doing other kinds of things? I just don't get it, really. The real estate values are dropping. You are underwriting at lower levels. The bond holders today are going to take a haircut to get financed out. The developer is going to have a little bit different deal or lose his property, but what is to keep the private market from just functioning right now? I really don't get it, and I don't understand why the focus is on us.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Well, there are a couple of different responses. One is that there are loans being made by insurance companies and some banks that are holding those loans----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","So that business is happening. Unfortunately--",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And it is heating up a little bit, isn't it?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","It has picked up, but there is just not a capacity for banks and insurance companies to fill the void that is left by the absence of securitization. They just don't have the balance sheet strength or size to write all the loans that need to be written. But it can be done. For the securitized, and you may have missed these comments, there is a mechanical issue in that there are a lot of people who would like to go and make loans to securitize, but it takes a great deal of time to aggregate a sufficient pool to go out and create a pool to securitize. It was 3 to 6 months. It may be 6 to 12 months today just because the market has slowed down. Traditionally, issuers would hedge their positions against movements in credit spreads or interest rates during that aggregation period, but there really aren't any instruments to do that now. There is no efficient way for them to warehouse their lines while they are--warehouse their portfolios while they are aggregating or hedge those specific interest rate risks--not credit risk, not credit of the underlying asset, but just movements in market spreads. And until that really exists, people are not willing to take on the balance sheet strain of aggregating a billion dollars' worth of new commercial mortgages, even if they are underwritten to lower values and better standards. Plus, there is so much uncertainty on what the ultimate execution might be for those securitizations. It is kind of a chicken and the egg. Once a few securitizations get done, an index will be able to be created so people can use that to hedge their positions. But until that happens----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Let me ask you, so I would assume there are, like, trillions of dollars of legacy securitizations that already are pulled together.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Mm-hmm.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","People have an operating history on those portfolios. So there would be no risk in aggregation. Those exist. So why isn't there a market to at least deal with the legacy issues? Why aren't people cranking that up and going in and writing those assets down? The operating history is there. I don't understand why that is not occurring and why somebody isn't willing just to put up some recourse liability to make that get done and move on.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","There is a market for both legacy loans and legacy securities. The securities market has been helped by TALF as an ability to finance those acquisitions, but there has been both TALF-financed and non-TALF-financed trading of mortgage securities. For whole loans, there is a market, as well, but those loans are being purchased based on new values and that requires the seller to recognize a loss, and many times sellers don't want to recognize that loss if they don't have to. So if a loan is written to $100 and the market value based on what you think the property is worth is $70, to sell the loan, you would sell it for $70 or less and then the owner of the loan would have to recognize a $30 loss. Well, if the mortgage is performing, it is a 10-year loan and there is sufficient cash-flow today to service that loan, the seller is going to forestall that sale until they ultimately have to, and hopefully between now and the time that loan matures, the value of the underlying asset may improve. So there hasn't been a lot of impetus for holders of whole loans to sell.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So back to the securitization--is it OK if I continue?",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Back to the securitization piece, I assume that what is happening on that side is the loans are just being extended, and if you happen to own some of those securities, you are just in them longer than you anticipated being in those securities.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","That decision is being made by the servicers alone on a case-by-case basis. In some cases, they are being extended. In some cases, they are being foreclosed or otherwise worked out. So there has been resolution, but there is just such a wave of requests for work-outs and modifications, it is going to take time to get through that.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","What role should--you know, there is a lot of discussion here about covered bonds, and I realize that at the volume levels we are talking about, it is not going to certainly supplant the need for securitizations down the road, but what level of faith should we as policymakers have in the cover loan process here in our country as it relates to commercial real estate?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","I think we want to not do anything that precludes commercial mortgages from being eligible to be in a covered bond issue. I don't think it is going to be the solution. It can be another tool to provide liquidity to the commercial real estate market, but because banks or the issuer has to keep those assets on their balance sheet and there will be regulatory capital requirements against those assets, it is a tool, but it is not going to be a sufficient tool to fill the void.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Let me just ask one more question.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Take your time.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Do you think there is a sense among a lot of the larger players that we are going to do something here? I am hearing that from some of the larger players, and so instead of going ahead and taking some of these write-downs and moving on and sort of taking the pain, they are waiting, thinking that either through TARP or some other mechanism here, we are going to create a solution.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","There is hope that something will happen, and some players are--may be waiting. I think it would be difficult to justify to sit around and wait for something to happen if you don't know it is going to happen, but that may be, in fact, the case.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Would it be a good signal to the market to let everybody know that TARP is over at the end of the year, that the circumstances that created the need for it are different and not there today, and would that help the market sort of move along versus this hope that there is a possibility that there won't be as great a loss and, therefore, let us hold on and not do the write-downs now?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","I think TARP and the TALF financing for commercial real estate has been a help. It has created liquidity and it has created trading volumes. Certainty, I think, is always beneficial. If people know absolutely when something is going to start and when it is going to stop, the market can react to it, and the market may not always react favorably, but it will react one way or the other. And I think part of the problem with some of these programs is they have had fits and starts, and people think it is going to go one way and then it goes another or dates aren't certain. So the market will react one way or another to certainty and I think certainty is beneficial for everybody.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Would anybody like to respond to the certainty of people knowing that this is a private sector issue? We may do some regulatory reform down the road, and I know Mr. Miller had some concerns about what some of those might be, and I guess in another setting we will probe those, but does anybody else want to respond to the people who are involved in commercial real estate financing knowing that nothing else is going to occur? Would that alone not help move along the process to some degree?",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","You know, the Government had become, through various programs, both the Fed, Treasury, TARP, TALF, PPIP, very involved in the financing of a wide variety of financial instruments, and I think rapidly removing all of those at once will certainly be detrimental to the market because there are no other mechanisms in place now. So I agree with the idea that certainty is important, but I also believe that there needs to be a transition period, given how extensive Government's involvement currently is in financing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","One clarification. It is not only certainty what Congressional action will be, but certainty of what the regulators are going to do and what the accountants are going to do, because all of those things have been interplaying and some of the good work that is done here is undermined by work that is done elsewhere in Washington or in Connecticut. So I think you need certainty on all fronts.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And I would just close by saying that in the event we did end TALF as, I think, everybody had hoped might happen at the end of the year, the programs that are funded right now, TALF and others, they would continue on until they ran out. So it wouldn't be like all the Government assistance that is occurring today would end at the same time. It is just there would be no more commitments. Thank you all for your testimony.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Corker. Let me begin a second round with a question that Mr. Hoeffel and others have raised, which is the FASB's role in the securitization process, particularly Statements 166 and 167, but all of the FASB rules affect this. Let us start with Mr. Hoeffel. Can you comment about how that might be inhibiting and what might be due to help FASB?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","OK. Well, FAS 166 and 167 get rid of the QSP, the qualified special purpose entity, that was the vehicle through which many securitizations were done. On a going- forward basis, I think we can work with that, but one of the key issues is that it is retroactive, so that people who have invested a small part of a securitization pool, maybe the bottom five to 10 percent, will be forced to consolidate all of the assets and all of the liabilities for that transaction onto their balance sheet, which could give them rate cap issues or low covenance, if they are a private company, on their financing. So it is a real challenge. It is almost impossible for these companies to get audited after the fact because they would have to consolidate everything down to the individual loan level, which may or may not be feasible given the terms of the loans themselves. So it is a significant challenge to the market. And further, given that there is some weakness in property markets, if a certain class got wiped out through recognized losses or realized losses, you could have the next bond holder have to consolidate. So you could theoretically have a BBB or a single-A investor suddenly have to consolidate, and that is not something they had envisioned at all when they bought those bonds. That will be specific to certain issues, but it is a challenge, both the lack of QSP for new issue and the consolidation that would happen for existing debt that is out there.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Any other comments? Mr. Miller.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just extending those comments a little bit to other parts of the securitization market, at a macro level, the outcome of the 166 and 167 accounting standards changes will be to require a large volume of securitized assets in many different product sectors to be put back onto balance sheets or to prevent them from moving off balance sheet. And our position--I want to be clear about this--is we are not for or against on- or off-balance sheet accounting. We simply think the accounting should be appropriate in light of exposure to risks or entitlement to assets. We think FASB's outcome in these standards is to--will result in an over- consolidation of many of these vehicles where the consolidating party really does not have meaningful entitlements to the benefits of those assets or exposure to the risks. Having said that, the standards have been--will be adopted. They will generally take effect in January. I think our bigger concern at this point, as I mentioned earlier, is the ripple effects of those accounting standards changes. If you picture a very large volume of assets coming back onto bank balance sheets exactly at a time when those balance sheets are already very constrained, the larger asset side of the balance sheets will attract higher regulatory capital charges. They will factor into leverage ratio calculations. They will attract loan loss reserves. And our concern, and we have heard this very forcefully from our members across a wide range of markets, is that that, coupled with other steps being considered, may constrict the ability of financial institutions to use their capital base to support new lending. And so we are very concerned, both about the accounting standards changes, but even more so now about the downstream impacts that those may have.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Any other comments on this issue?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","One other thought is that the 5-percent retention that is being discussed in the regulatory reform proposals will--this sort of flies in the fact of that, because if you are required to retain 5 percent, now you are going to have to consolidate. So it exacerbates some of the issues that Mr. Miller mentioned.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Let me raise another issue with Mr. Hoeffel, and anyone else, and that is, there seems to be one distinction between residential mortgage-backed securitization and remedies and commercial, which is commercial bankruptcy code is available to the individual mortgages if they default. Is that a difference that makes a difference in terms of the commercial market versus the residential market?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","I think it will impact the resolution of workouts, and we have seen that forestall some of the workouts that have happened in some very large securitizations to date. We are still waiting to hear what the outcome of some of those cases are. So, again, I think that process, because commercial borrowers can file for bankruptcy--we have tried to avoid that through recourse carveouts for bankruptcy, but even that seems to be not as enforceable as maybe some people had thought. So it does create, again, more uncertainty, which is a challenge for investors going forward.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","But at least in the commercial context, the access to bankruptcy was clearly understood before the securitization process took place. And I guess the question would be if someone has the ability to work it out, it is understood beforehand. That is anticipated by the investors. Does that facilitate the process at all or is it sort of neutral?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hoeffel","Well, investors always knew that bankruptcy was an option and always has been. We tried structurally to limit a borrower's ability to file for a bankruptcy by putting most securitized loans into special purpose entities where you needed unanimity of all the directors to file for bankruptcy, and there you had independent directors that would not file for bankruptcy on a solvent entity. Again, there have been some court challenges to that, and many of us are waiting to find out what will happen. Nobody thought that commercial real estate, even in an SPE, was completely bankruptcy proof, but we did think that there were enough hurdles to that to provide protections for investors.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Professor McCoy, you have suggested that borrowers be given an affirmative claim against assignees, a violation of Federal lending standards. Can you elaborate on that? Then I would ask others to comment on that proposal.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes, I would be glad to. We are in a situation right now where in the majority of States, if a borrower's loan is sold, generally through securitization, they lose, without their consent, their defenses to collection and their ability to sue the holder of the loan for consumer protection violations and fraud. And where the rubber really hits the road is when that borrower is sued for foreclosure. If the loan has been securitized, let us say the borrower was defrauded originally, the loan later goes into foreclosure, under State law the borrower cannot raise the fraud as a defense to foreclosure. They lost that, and they lost that through a process over which they had no say. In addition, because the borrowers can really only sue their lender, or their mortgage broker, it means that we do not have the threat of making the borrower whole that investment banks have to care about; that investors have to care about when they think about will we do due diligence or just rely on the rating agency. And I feel in order to bring rationality and consistency to the entire mortgage process, we need to allow borrowers to bring claims of fraud and consumer protection violations against whoever holds their loan. Now, there are ways you can structure this liability that rating agencies can rate and that securitization can function with. Economists and I and other coauthors studied the effect of similar laws in nine States, and what we found is in six of those States, access to subprime credit actually increased, holding everyone else constant, despite assignee liability. In three of the States, depending on the indicator, the results were mixed, but in no State was there an affirmative drop in access to credit.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","And I am going to ask others to comment on this, obviously, but to follow up, would this be a way to complement or displace the requirement of the Administration to hold 5 percent of a mortgage or 5 percent to give the originator sort of some skin in the game or----",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","I view it as a complement. I am supportive of the Administration's 5-percent retention measure, but my concern is even though the Administration would prohibit hedging it, I do not think that that prohibition is enforceable because often hedges are taken on a broad variety of positions. And there is a lot of devil in the details with respect to that proposal, so I would have assignee liability as well.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Mr. Miller, and anyone else who wants to jump in on this issue.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Certainly borrowers should have remedies and defenses against fraud that may relate proximately to a foreclosure action against them. The details, though, of any assignee liability mechanisms are very, very important and should be addressed at that level of detail. But, broadly speaking, the securitization industry would have very significant concerns about broad-based assignee liability. While, again, the interests of the borrowers here are primary, at the same time those borrower interests are also served by having investors who are willing to commit capital to the mortgage-backed securities markets. And if those investors are potentially subject to downstream claims by borrowers for origination defects over which they have absolutely no ability to perform diligence upon or to verify, they are not sitting at the loan closing table, my fear is that and I think the industry's fear is that if those types of assignee liability provisions are broadly introduced, it will significantly curtail, if not dry up completely, the willingness of investors to take that risk. If it is not a risk that they can manage, I do not believe that it is a risk that they are broadly going to undertake. So there are some very significant competing considerations that would weigh against broad-based assignee liability.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Just a follow-up. Would one of aspect of this might be that those investors would be much more careful about what they are buying and what they are investing in? Because they would like to make sure that the originator was doing their job in underwriting and that would be a market solution to this problem.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","I think they certainly want to be and will be more careful. I think the issue, though, is whether they really are in a position even with the extreme time and effort and due diligence to be able to know whether, in fact, fraud was committed. I do not think they can be in that position, and so there, I do not think that at least it is a universal solution or market-based response that could work.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Mr. Davidson, do you have a comment?",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","Sure. In both my written statement and oral statement, I mentioned this idea of an origination certificate.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Davidson","And the idea of that is an alternative to both the assignee liability and the current way that representations and warranties travel through the system. And the idea there is to say that these are the obligations of the originator and that that tracks along with the loan, or whoever the investor is, and stays as an obligation back to the borrower, and that we also track through a bonding system or other capital system capital of that originator or lender so that in the case there are violations of representations and warranties or there is fraud against the borrower, there is money to go after. And so this puts the responsibility in the hands of the person who created the problem rather than other parties who really, as Mr. Miller has said, cannot really know exactly what happened.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","All right. And, Mr. Miller, you have also suggested a unique identification number for loans. How would that work? And would it work in conjunction with Mr. Davidson's proposal? Or what other aspects would it help?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","I think that it would, and just building on what Mr. Davidson just indicated, I think also the representations and warranties and enhancements there are really, I think, very consistent with what he was stating in terms of creating an ongoing economic responsibility. His proposal is a bit of a variation on that theme. I think the unique loan identifier, which ASF has recently announced, will broadly assist the process of being able to drill down to the individual level of the mortgage loan as that makes its way into the secondary and debt capital market so that no matter what type of securities structure--it could be a whole loan sale, it could be a mortgage-backed securitization, it could be another type of instrument down the road--investors and other parties would be able to identify the specific loans underlying that instrument and coupled with the other data, standardization enhancements through Project Restart, be able to perform analytics at a very deep level of detail, providing investors and other market participants with a much better window into the performance characteristics and risk profiles of those loans and, thus, the securities that they are a part of.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. One final area of questioning, and that is, many of these securitizations depend on REMIC, the real estate conduit tax treatment. And there has been some discussion that because of the structure of these vehicles, it is very difficult to modify mortgages held in them because in some cases it requires unanimous consent, which is hard to get if you are at the lowest tranche. And I am wondering as we go forward, should we consider conditioning this favorable treatment on an agreement to modify loans that are financially appropriate? I mean, you know, not subsidized loans, but if the modification will have a value more than a foreclosure, then that should be done? Professor McCoy, and then anyone else who wants to comment.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Yes, I think this is essential. There seem to be three impediments right now. One is that perhaps the REMIC rules themselves discourage workouts, although the IRS has been trying to soften that. The second problem is servicer compensation often is more lucrative if you go to foreclosure. That is a separate problem that needs to be fixed. But, last, servicers do have some justifiable fear that they will be sued by one set of tranche holders if they benefit another in the process of doing a good-faith workout. And I think we can use the REMIC rules to say the trust will not receive Federal tax favored treatment unless these problems are solved, so that when workouts are cost effective, that they go forward, and the servicer has the incentive to do it and is not worried about lawsuits. If I could work in one other thing?",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Yes, please.",Speech, 
"Ms. McCoy","Which is with respect to assignee liability, again and again we hear this claim that investors will not come to the table if there is carefully crafted assignee liability that does not expect investors to do the impossible. In fact, in States that had carefully crafted standards, investors did fund those loans. What drove them away was the failure of securitization. So it is ironic to talk about assignee liability driving them away when securitization was able to do that just fine on its own.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Any other comments, particularly on this REMIC question? Mr. Miller.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Yes, I do not think that the REMIC regulations are themselves an impediment at all to loan modifications that are otherwise contractually permitted. I think it is really quite well established that under the REMIC regulations, if a mortgage loan is in default or that default is reasonably foreseeable, which covers, I think, a lot of territory, that a loan modification can be pursued-- again, subject to any contractual requirements in the securitization itself. Having said that, I do not believe that it would be advisable public policy to condition REMIC qualification or continuing REMIC qualification on requirements to perform modifications or to do that in a certain way. Again, I think that would threaten the tax treatment that is provided through the REMIC regulations in a way that would, again, chill or inhibit participation and create distortions in the marketplace. To the extent that there are solutions or improvements to the loan modification process, I think we should address those frontally and head on. Part of Project Restart looking forward prospectively is to support changes and develop standardized provisions governing loan modifications and loss mitigation for future securitization transactions to address uncertainties or ambiguities in the way that that language is currently constructed in those transactions. So I think the better way would be to address it directly and not indirectly through the Tax Code.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Just a follow-up question. The point that Professor McCoy makes about the incentives for services financially, in some cases--not all, obviously--that foreclosure provides them more income than a modification, which takes time, et cetera, and that seems to be a classic case of the obvious benefit to one person but socially a cost to all of us because as more and more mortgages go into default and foreclosure, it is hurting the economy grievously. So is that something that we can correct or should correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miller","Well, I think the answer that I would give to that is, regardless of incentives of any of the parties who are involved in that circumstance, again, at least in the securitization context, the duties and obligations and responsibilities of servicers are laid out in the contracts, they are and should be held to those standards by investors and others. So regardless of any potential incentive that they may have--and I personally think that some of the arguments about servicing incentives to foreclose as opposed to, you know, taking reasonable workout strategies, especially where that can yield a greater net present value, I think some of those statements are overstated or exaggerated. But, again, you know, I think that really is something that is determined and dictated by contract and the parties should be held to their contractual obligations.",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","Just a final point. You are talking about prospectively fixing this system. But currently we are looking at estimates range from 4 million to 6 million foreclosures next year, which is a huge drag on the economy and which may, in fact, be sufficient drag to cutoff or at least to deflect the growth and the prosperity we are all hoping for. So I think we are confronting--I applaud your efforts to go forward prospectively, but we have a huge problem with what we have to deal with right now. Anyone else who has a comment on this topic?",Speech, 
"Chairman Reed","If not, let me thank you all again for excellent testimony. I think Senator Gregg said it very well: great insights together with very specific suggestions and done in a very concise and understandable way. So thank you all for your wonderful testimony. The hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
