"Speaker","Speech"
"The Chairman","The hearing will come to order. We are here today for the second day of hearings on the Administration's proposal for a change in the regulatory structure, and in particular today, we have advocacy groups of various sorts that have focused on consumer civil rights and community economic concerns. All of the issues that are embodied in this are before us. As was the case yesterday, I think we probably have some particular interest among many of the witnesses today in the proposed consumer agency, but, as I said, all of the various aspects of that are before us. I will begin. We will have 10 minutes of opening statements on each side and then proceed with our panel. The need for regulation seems clear, and I think we should understand that this is, to a great extent, part of a historical pattern. We have a private sector economy in which the private sector generates wealth, and we are all supportive of that. There is constant innovation in the private sector, as there should be. At certain points in history, the level of innovation reaches a point where there is almost a qualitative change in the way in which certain institutions function. Now we should be very clear. None of these institutions, none of these new approaches, would survive if they did not add significant value in the society because they are voluntary. And if they did not add value, nobody would participate and provide any funds for them. The problem comes when they innovate, provide a great deal of benefit, but precisely because they are innovative, occur in a regulatory vacuum. There are no rules, and the free market clearly needs rules to function well. Rules to give investors, the people who will be making the money available, some confidence. Rules to protect the great majority of people in the business who want to be honest and follow all the rules from those who don't. We had a situation in the late 19th Century where the innovation was large industrial enterprises. If you looked at the structure of American enterprise in the 1880's and 1890's, it was very different than it was in the 1940's and 1950's. It was larger. Those large enterprises were good, because you could not have had the degree of industrialization and wealth creation that we have had without them. But they operated in a regulatory vacuum. So after the creation of the large enterprises in the latter part of the 19th Century, you had Woodrow Wilson and Theodore Roosevelt, in reverse order, adopting rules, the Federal Trade Commission, the Federal Reserve system, antitrust acts to try to preserve the benefit of those large institutions without much of the harm. That worked pretty well but it, in turn, led to another situation where the newest innovation in terms of its impact was the stock market, because with large enterprises, you could not have individually financed entities or family financed entities. You needed a stock market. The stock market, obviously, did a lot of good, but it caused a lot of problems because there were no regulations. So in the New Deal you saw regulations both in the banking industry and of the equity industry. That worked for a long period of time. Beginning in the 1980's, into the 1990's, and culminating in this past decade, a new round of innovations came up. Banks became less important, because there were ways for people to aggregate the money and lend it out outside of banks. So bank regulation covered less and less of the activity. Securitization came into being, which meant that the discipline that came from the lender/borrower relationship eroded. Derivatives were created without an adequate regulatory structure. I think we are in the third of those periods that I just mentioned, where innovation that essentially does a lot of good outstripped regulation by definition. And our job is to try to fashion regulations with regard to derivatives; with regard to excessive leverage; with regard to loan originations by people who have no economic interest in their being repaid; with regard to the model in which so many mortgages--such a large part of the economy--are held in a split fashion, where there are those with ownership interest and those with the control of the instrument and they are not always able to work together. And it is not that we have had innovations that are bad. It is that innovations by definition are unregulated. The lack of regulation I believe has caused serious problems. And our job is, as it was for Woodrow Wilson, Franklin Roosevelt, and Theodore Roosevelt, to come up with rules that minimize the damage while maximizing the benefit. Now I know--let me say in closing--there were those who tell us we will be killing off the innovations by doing this. I can save them the time. They don't have to write these speeches. They can go back to 1902 and 1903 and dig out what people said about Theodore Roosevelt and then later about Woodrow Wilson, and they can go back to 1933 and 1934 and be right here in the Congressional Record, and they can get all the speeches about how regulation will inherently kill off these activities. Yes, excessive regulation and incompetent regulation and foolish regulation can do that, but well-done regulation, as it did under Theodore Roosevelt and Woodrow Wilson and as it did under Franklin Roosevelt, can help, and that is what we intend to try to do today. The gentleman from California is recognized for 4 minutes."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We really do need regulation. And what happens when a regulator fails in his task to make certain that you don't have overleveraging in the financial institutions is something like what happened with AIG. You end up with overleveraging of 170 to 1. Banks typically are regulated to make certain they don't overleverage more than 10 to 1. The consequences are catastrophic when a regulator misses something like that. The consequences also are catastrophic when, for example, GSEs were leveraged 100 to 1. In this case, the regulators did catch it, but in this case we in Congress did not take the decisive action necessary to allow those regulators the power to deleverage Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. And, likewise, you have a consequence there of an impact to the system, a shock to the system. And with that kind of overleveraging in a society, you end up also, of course, with a consequence of helping to create a boom or an expansion, an overexpansion in housing. Now we're here today again talking about the regulatory reform proposal issued by the Administration, and, logically, the consumer financial products agency is going to be discussed here today, as it was yesterday. We know what happens when you separate solvent protection from consumer protection. We saw it with the regulatory structure over Fannie and Freddie. OFHEO focused on safety and soundness and for years competed against HUD, who was enforcing the affordable housing goals, akin to mission oversight in that case so you had that competition. Those affordable housing goals pushed by one agency led to the build-up of junk loans in Fannie and Freddie, which ultimately led to their demise. Going forward, it will be very difficult to create a separate regulatory entity, charge it with consumer protection oversight, and not expect similar politically driven mandates to come further down the road. There is a reason why virtually every Federal safety and soundness regulator has expressed concern over this proposal that we are talking about today. And it isn't because they are trying to protect their regulatory turf. It is because it is a flawed idea. Consumers benefit from a competitive market with adequately capitalized institutions that consumers know will be there down the road. In many ways, solvency protection is the most effective form of consumer protection. Instead of bifurcating the mission of the various regulators, we should ensure consumers throughout the financial system have the tools necessary to make sound, educated financial institutions. What we are doing with the plan that is being put forward today, I am concerned, is you are going to eliminate choice by requiring government bureaucrats to define what are suitable financial products. And then it gives each State the ability to change those standards. To avoid litigation, institutions will have no choice but to sell only one-size-fits-all products. Also, the plan put forward here that we are discussing would add an additional layer of bureaucracy on top of the current regulatory patchwork, with broad, undefined, and arbitrary powers which would impose requirements that would likely conflict with those of other regulatory agencies. So the plan invites the kind of turf battles that will undermine rather than promote effective consumer protection. And lastly, in terms of lawsuits, we know what the consequence is going to be of outlawing mandatory arbitration clauses. Creating subjective standards for what constitutes acceptable products and reasonable disclosures, that is inevitably going to lead to more lawsuits. So the plan put forward here in this committee today I am afraid will impose new taxes and fees on consumer financial transactions, increase the cost of borrowing and create a government bureaucracy. And, frankly, what we should be doing is providing regulators with more investigative and enforcement tools, increasing civil penalties, and maximizing restitution of victims of fraud. That should be our focus here and we should streamline and consolidate regulations of financial institutions, including consumer protection, so that no institution can game the system. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Speier, for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Ms. Speier","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for having the backbone to continue this fight to make sure consumers in America have a choice. The taxpayers have spent more than $2 trillion to turn around an economic crisis that had its foundation in the insatiable appetite of Wall Street for the high yields provided by mortgage-backed securities and the fees that went with them. We got liar loans and no-doc loans and pick-a-payment loans that had no relation to the borrower's ability to pay. It didn't matter, because the loans were cut up into pieces and bundled and rated triple A. Lots of people got rich, and the foundation of this economy crumbled. Today, we are going to talk about what we can do for the consumers of America now that we have taken care of Wall Street. We heard yesterday from the banks, both big and small, about how they weren't responsible for the current financial crisis and consumer protection should be left with the existing regulators. Well, the existing regulators have had 14 years, and what have they done in 14 years to fix the problem? Sixty percent of the subprime borrowers would have qualified for cheaper mortgages, but they didn't get them. They talked about how the consumers must have choice and access to innovative financial products, about how a Consumer Financial Protection Agency is somehow going to shut down access to credit for consumers or drive the price of credit sky high, about how they will be subject to 50 standards. These arguments are scare tactics intended to delay action until the economy starts to recover, as it inevitably will, and the political will for bold reform will fade. The choice and innovation argument only works when the parties involved are on an equal negotiating level. Furthermore, what is wrong with plain vanilla? Innovative products have equaled paying for the consumers and ripoffs to the taxpayers. You can't tell me that a kindergarten teacher buying her first home or a firefighter who has been offered a teaser rate to transfer a large balance from one credit card to another is on an even playing field with the phalanx of lawyers deployed by Citibank or Bank of America or Wells Fargo who write 30 pages of legalese in print so small that even triple- strength reading glasses aren't enough to reveal the real terms. A Consumer Financial Protection Agency will not limit creative or innovative products. It will, however, limit the ability to run roughshod over the consumers. Terms will have to be clear and fully disclosed, and the consumer may have to opt in. And although opt in seems to be a dirty word to those in the financial industry, it simply means that the consumer will actually have to affirmatively agree to the terms. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Illinois for 3 minutes."
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our financial regulatory system is broken, and our job is to clean it up, making it more efficient and effective. However, as I expressed during yesterday's hearing, I fear that we are moving in the wrong direction when we strip from the banking regulators their mission to protect consumers. Our country got into this financial mess because there were simply too many regulators who weren't doing their job and were not talking to one another. So the logical answer to this problem of too many regulators not doing their job should be to consolidate and require more efficient, frequent, and effective regulators. Instead, H.R. 3126 in the Administration's proposal goes 180 degrees in the opposite direction by placing the responsibility to protect consumers with a new government bureaucracy, an agency that I think should be called the Credit Rationing and Pricing Agency. And why do I say this? Because this new agency that tells consumers what they can and cannot do and businesses large and small what they can and cannot offer to consumers can only result in one or more of three things: First, many consumers who enjoy access to credit today will be denied credit in the future. Second, riskier consumers will have access to affordable products or plain vanilla products, but who will pay for that risk? That is the less risky consumer whose cost of credit will certainly increase. And, third, financial institutions will be told to offer certain products at a low cost to risky consumers, which will jeopardize the safety and soundness of the financial institution. Secretary Geithner last week couldn't really answer the question: Would the safety and soundness banking regulator trump a new consumer if the consumer's regulatory policy would put the bank in an unsafe territory? Maybe some of our witnesses today can explain what would happen in that situation. In addition, maybe some of our witnesses today can better explain why we should keep CRA with a prudential regulator but not the consumer protection regulation. I am very skeptical that, for consumers, the answer is making government bigger and eliminating Federal preemption. I think it weakens the system and could very well be detrimental to consumers, businesses, and the U.S. economy at a time when we can least afford it. We must first do no harm, and we must find a balanced approach to financial regulation. I think our Republican plan that puts all of the banking regulators and consumer protection functions under one roof is a better answer for the consumer and really gets to the heart of preventing another financial meltdown. With that, I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from California, Ms. Waters, for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and members. I am still shaken from yesterday when we had the financial services community representatives, bankers, etc., come before us and take on the consumer financial agency with great opposition, giving us 101 reasons why we didn't need it, how it was going to cost the taxpayer more money, how it would interfere with safety and soundness, and on and on and on. But I am even more shaken with what is happening in the underground with the huge amount of money that the bankers and financial services community representatives are going to spend to lobby Members of Congress. I understand they almost have hired a lobbyist for each one of us. I never expected, given the subprime meltdown and the number of foreclosures we have, that we would get that kind of opposition. How soon we forget. And I am more concerned that there are Members of Congress who are beginning to take on the arguments of the financial services industry about why a consumer financial agency is not necessary. Many of the people who are before us today have been fighting as nonprofits against predatory lending, opposition to bank mergers, forcing mortgage disclosure. I remember being in the fight with some on redlining, fighting to create CRA, helping to create the Cooling Off Period, Truth in Lending. And they are forever chasing the very-well-heeled financial services community, trying to protect the consumers. And now we have an opportunity to really show that we want to protect the consumers with an agency that will have the word ``consumer'' in it, and we have people who are backing off. I am even more shocked that, as this chairman has provided opportunities for us to interact with the financial services industry, it has basically been dishonored. Even yesterday, when we were engaged with consumer advocates, one member got up and left and went to a fundraiser with the banking community in the middle of all of that. Well, all I have to say is I am hopeful that our advocates will be stronger than ever and that we will fight against this opposition. We will respect our consumers. We will not forget the still-growing number of foreclosures that are out there created by greedy loan initiators, and we will do a job for the consumers despite the lobbyists and the money and the opposition to this. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, for 3 minutes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over the course of these last couple of hearings and listening to some of the opening statements, it is clear that we are witnessing a clash of principles, and there is much at stake. I think the question is, in a free society, how does the State best protect consumers rights? Clearly, the right and the left do not agree. As I listen to my friends on the other side of the aisle, I am almost left with the impression that many of them believe that every consumer is a hapless fool incapable of discerning what is best for she and her family, that creditors are a powerful, monolithic evil in our society that only exist to victimize consumers. The left seems to believe that if only we will empower some type of ruling enlightened elite, that only then can consumers hope for fairness and justice. But in order to receive all of this, somehow consumers are expected to yield their rights to the State in order to be protected. Most of us on this side of the aisle believe something else. We believe that the best form of consumer protection comes from competitive markets, competitive markets that are vigorously policed for force and fraud. It is not business we believe in. It is competitive markets we believe in. And we believe in empowering consumers with effective and factual disclosure. And we believe fundamentally in the freedom to choose, the fundamental economic liberty of every American citizen to decide for himself what consumer financial products are best for he and his family. And that is the difference. I simply cannot understand how you protect a consumer by assaulting consumer rights. I simply don't get it. I don't understand how passing legislation that ultimately will result in less competition empowers the consumer. I don't understand how passing legislation that will stifle innovation, perhaps the next ATM machine, the next frequent flyer mile offering on a credit card--how by stifling innovation are you somehow protecting the consumer? I don't get it. And if we look at the turmoil, the economic turmoil that we find ourselves in today, it is the result of one and only one product, and that is subprime mortgages, more specifically, a subprime ARM. You know, Congress has acted. And, besides that, some of the people who took out these loans took out loans that they knew any couldn't repay in the first place. And so I hope that we are not taking advantage of the situation. It is more important that we get it done right than that we get it done quickly. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","We will now begin with the panel, and we will begin with a man with whose work I am very familiar and of which I am very admiring, Joseph Flatley from the Mass Housing Investment Corporation. Let me say at the outset, any additional material that anyone on the panel or on the committee wants to submit for the record will be accepted, if there is no objection, and I hear none. So the record is open for any submissions. Mr. Flatley? "
"STATEMENT OF JOSEPH L. FLATLEY, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MASSACHUSETTS HOUSING INVESTMENT CORPORATION, ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING LENDERS (NAAHL)"," "
"Mr. Flatley","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My name is Joe Flatley, and I am CEO--"
"The Chairman","You better pull the microphone closer, Joe. Move the papers. You are so faint."
"Mr. Flatley","Again, my name is Joe Flatley, and I am president and CEO of--"
"Mr. Meeks","It is not working."

"The Chairman","Wait, hold on, is the microphone not working as someone said?"
"Mr. Flatley","The green light is on."
"The Chairman","Pull it very close to you. Just don't do it an inch at a time, Joe."
"Mr. Flatley","It will be down my throat in a second. Can you hear me now?"
"The Chairman","I will ask that we get the electricians in. This is not our first problem with the electrical equipment. Are any of the microphones working? We will wait a minute until they are. Is somebody working on it? We will have to wait until they come. Mr. Flatley, I don't think we have to look at you. We have to hear you. Please come take up the seat right up here and turn on the Member's mike and do it from here. I am not going to sit around waiting for the mikes. I assume that people will forego looking at Mr. Flatley while he speaks, because hearing him is more important. And please sit down right there, turn on the mike, and start speaking. If Members insist, we will get a staffer with a big mirror, but, until then, Mr. Flatley, please proceed. I am not going to hold this up."
"Mr. Flatley","Good morning. My name is Joe Flatley, and I am president and CEO of the Massachusetts Housing Investment Corporation in Boston. I am also the former chairman and currently a board member of the National Association of Affordable Housing Lenders (NAAHL). You have a copy of my written statement, so I just want to summarize and make a few general points. First of all, NAAHL supports Chairman Frank's decision to preserve the bank regulators' role to enforce the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). CRA is an enormous success story and big business, resulting in hundreds of billions of dollars each year invested in low- and moderate-income communities. It annually funds this money into investment in low- and moderate- income communities, financing affordable rental housing, home purchases, charter schools, day care facilities, and small business and micro enterprise loans. Second, we believe that the regulators should revise the CRA regulations to update the rules so they do not discourage bank participation in community development activities that work to benefit low- and moderate-income communities. Third, any statutory changes in CRA should be carefully considered, practical to implement, and should incentivize high-impact community development activities that may fall outside of a bank's normal course of business. Fourth, the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency should have the authority needed to put an end to the problem of the dual-mortgage market that has contributed to mortgage meltdown. If I could add a few general comments about CRA and the reason CRA has been such a tremendous success. First of all, I think it is important to remember that the vast majority of lower-income households are renters, and CRA promotes lending and investing in rental housing and community development and not just in credit to consumers. Second, CRA imposes an affirmative obligation on financial institutions and not just consumer protection on what they may or may not do. Third, despite its flaws, CRA works, and it works in part due to the leverage of the bank regulatory agencies. So if we are going to revise the CRA statute, we should do so very carefully so it would do no harm to a program that has been an enormous success. I am prepared to take questions. "
"The Chairman","No, we will go to the next witness."

"The Chairman","Yes, it does. We can resume the regular seating order. Mr. Ireland? "
"STATEMENT OF OLIVER I. IRELAND, PARTNER, MORRISON & FOERSTER LLP"," "
"Mr. Ireland","Good morning, Chairman Frank, Mr. Hensarling, and members of the committee. I am a partner in the financial services practice in the Washington, D.C., office of Morrison & Foerster. I previously spent 26 years with the Federal Reserve System, 15 years as an Associate General Counsel at the Board in Washington. I am pleased to be here today to address the Administration's financial regulatory reform proposals and, in particular, the consumer protection aspects of the proposals. The current recession was sparked by problems in subprime and Alt-A residential mortgages. As a result, investors lost confidence in subprime and Alt-A mortgage-backed securities. The loss in confidence spread to other mortgage-backed securities, disrupting the flow of funds for mortgage credit and leading to a downward spiral in housing prices and a panoply of new government programs and extraordinary actions by Federal regulators. Clearly, these events warrant a rethinking of what has worked, what has not worked, and why, in financial regulation. The Administration has proposed to create a new stand-alone Consumer Financial Protection Agency to protect consumers of financial products and services. Although I strongly support the goal of consumer protection, I believe that creating a separate stand-alone agency for this purpose ignores the increasingly vertically integrated nature of the market for consumer financial services. A primary reason for regulating consumer financial services is that we believe these services are beneficial for consumers. Leading up to the current crisis, excess demand for mortgage-backed securities encouraged mortgage origination practices that later triggered the panic in the secondary market. The relationship between these steps and the mortgage lending process was interactive, and neither is fully understood by looking at only one step in the process. In order to foster an efficient market for home mortgages, it is necessary to have an understanding of the entire market, from the consumer borrower to the ultimate investor, and the role of that market in the economy as a whole. The oversight and regulation of each component of the market needs to take into consideration its effect on the other components. Bifurcating regulation of the market, as is contemplated by creation of a dedicated consumer protection agency, is likely to create conflicts between the agency and prudential supervisors. The expertise of each regulator will be less available to the others than under the current regulatory structure, making each of their jobs more difficult rather than easier and leading to a less efficient, rather than a more efficient, market for home mortgages. These considerations weigh strongly against creation of a separate agency. The countervailing argument is, of course, that the current system did not work to prevent the mortgage crisis and that changes are needed. The mortgage crisis has been a product of multiple failures at all levels, both in the public and private sectors. The fact that regulators may have made errors suggests that steps should be taken to prevent similar errors in the future. However, my view, it does not mean the architecture of the regulatory system is the problem. There is a strong relationship between consumer issues, prudential supervision and, ultimately, monetary policy. In the end, these interests are not in conflict. Rather, they all seek the same goal, a healthy economy and a high standard of living for all Americans. The goal of regulatory policy should be to ensure that prudential and consumer interest are harmonized, rather than that they are in conflict. The creation of a separate agency is a recipe for conflict, rather than harmonization. Thank you for the opportunity to be here today to address this important issue, and I will be happy to answer questions. "
"The Chairman","Next, Mr. Mierzwinski. "
"STATEMENT OF EDMUND MIERZWINSKI, CONSUMER PROGRAM DIRECTOR, U.S. PUBLIC INTEREST RESEARCH GROUP (U.S. PIRG)"," "
"Mr. Mierzwinski","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Congressman Hensarling, and members of the committee. I am Ed Mierzwinski of U.S. PIRG, as are several of the witnesses here. U.S. PIRG is a founding member of Americans for Financial Reform, ourfinancialsecurity.org, a coalition of civil society members across the spectrum supporting broad reform. My written testimony goes into detail about a number of aspects of the Obama plan, including its new investor protections to provide for greater fiduciary responsibilities on broker dealers, its limits on executive pay, and tying risk to longer-term-pay incentives rather than the greedy, short- term incentives that have helped precipitate the crisis. I also talk about the aspects of prudential regulation and the notion of a new systemic risk regulator. We point out that if it is to be the Fed, the Fed needs democratization and greater transparency. First of all, I also want to mention that one area where we think the proposal is extremely deficient is in the area of credit rating agencies. There needs to be much more regulation of credit rating agencies. We also are disappointed that it doesn't include enough on solving the mortgage and homeowner and foreclosure crises. I want to spend the bulk of my time talking about the centerpiece of the reform, and that is the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. We look at this as a game changer, as a critically important new solution to a failed regulatory system. The system failed because the regulators had conflicts of interest, and the regulators did not impose the civil penalties that they had available to them. The regulators did not establish rules to protect consumers in the marketplace. Those rules could have helped prevent the mortgage crisis, as everyone knows. Fourteen years after the Congress gave the Fed authority over the Homeownership and Equity Protection Act to create rules on predatory lending, didn't do anything until after the crisis had passed. Complaints about credit cards reached a fever pitch while the OCC slept, the overdraft loan problem. And so Congress had to step in and act under the leadership of Congresswoman Maloney and this committee. The regulators finally created some rules on credit cards, but the Congress, fortunately, had already suggested the rules, and then the Congress went further and made the rules into a law. The issue of overdraft fees, banks are now making the bulk of their income on an unfair business model, overdraft fees where the regulators have allowed them to trick consumers into using their debit cards even when they have no money in their accounts. And the regulators have allowed the banks to change the order that deposited checks and items are cleared so that consumers will face more overdraft charges at the end of the day. We have a number of other problems that we describe in our testimony, in our written testimony, both this month and last month, where the regulators have simply failed to go after the banks. So the idea of a new regulator that has only one job, protecting consumers, is one of the best ideas this Congress has had. It will not have conflicts of interest. It will not have two jobs to do. It will focus on consumer protection. But you cannot set the new regulator up to fail. You must keep it independent, and you must also do the other things that the Obama Administration has suggested and that your bill, Mr."
"Chairman, retains","You must keep the Federal law as a floor of consumer protection and allow the States to go higher. The States are nimbler. Often, they respond more quickly, and they provide good ideas to the Congress. In my testimony, I outline how in the 2003 FACT Act, Congress allowed the States to continue to investigate identity theft. Forty-six States and the District of Columbia came up with a security freeze model that allows consumers to protect themselves. Giving the States the ability to go further is the best way that we can protect consumers from new threats, because the States can act more quickly. And the idea that State attorneys general can enforce the law is not balkanization. Providing State attorneys general at the enforcement level the ability to enforce the law, that is an area where you want competition. You want many enforcers. You don't want many rule writers. You don't want many agencies where banks can choose to charter shop to avoid regulation, but you do want a lot of cops on the beat, and you do want to give consumers the right to enforce the laws. We wish the bill went further on giving consumers a private right of action, but we are very pleased that the new agency will have the authority to ban unfair forced arbitration in consumer contracts. Thank you. "
"The Chairman","Ms. Murguia. "
"STATEMENT OF JANET MURGUIA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL COUNCIL OF LA RAZA (NCLR)"," "
"Ms. Murguia","Thank you. Good morning. My name is Janet Murguia, and I am president and CEO of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR). NCLR has been committed to improving the life opportunities of the Nation's 40 million Latinos for the last 4 decades, and I would just like to thank Chairman Frank and Ranking Member Bachus for inviting us to testify today. Our Latino families are experiencing record high foreclosures and mounting credit card debt. These are clear symptoms of weak oversight and gaps in consumer protections. Through our homeownership network, NCLR serves more than 38,000 home buyers and homeowners every year. But, these days, our counselors have shifted their focus from homeownership to foreclosure prevention. We are in the trenches every day fighting to save homes and build wealth in our community. The fact is, though, that our national banking system is failing communities of color. All Americans need access to bank accounts and credit to move up the economic ladder. A well- functioning system will put families on a path of financial security, not unwieldy debt. It will build wealth that future generations can rely on. I just want to make three points today. I want to highlight the major weaknesses in our current system, ways in which the Administration's proposal addresses those weaknesses, and just a couple of recommendations to strengthen the reforms. In regards to the current system, there is overwhelming evidence showing that minority borrowers pay more to access credit than their White peers. For example, Hispanic borrowers are twice as likely to receive high-cost mortgages. Latino credit card users are twice as likely as White cardholders to have interest rates over 20 percent. This trend is repeated among auto loans, bank accounts, and other financial services. This pattern of overpayment, abuse, and discrimination disrupts the financial stability of low-income and minority communities and impedes their improvement towards the middle class. Specifically, there are four ways the market fails our families: shopping for credit is nearly impossible; borrowers are still steered toward expensive products, even when they have good credit and high incomes; creditors trap borrowers in cycles of debt; and fraud and scams are rampant. NCLR applauds the broad reforms proposed by the Obama Administration. The market's breakdown has had a devastating impact that extends well beyond those initially harmed. As the proposed reforms make their way through Congress, there are four areas of particular importance to all communities of color: The missions of promoting access to credit and protecting borrowers are housed in the same regulatory agency. We agree. NCLR supports an independent regulator that will evaluate new financial products. These evaluations must be completed in light of credit needs of diverse communities. We want to make sure that we are holding all players in the market accountable. Deception, scams, and discrimination are present in all aspects of the market. Emphasizing simple, straightforward banking and credit products. This is an important part of this proposal, and we want to make sure that it is included. The fourth point is making enforcement a priority. The plan creates a meaningful way to analyze and respond to consumer complaints, protects private rights of action, and creates new tools for regulators to assess systemic risk. The concepts for promoting greater access to credit and increasing protections are not in conflict. Across the country, credit unions, community banks, and nonprofits are leaders in this area. They are creating alternatives to payday loans, offering free checking accounts, and using nontraditional credit information to underwrite loans. They do it while upholding highest standards of safety and soundness and generally offer prime pricing. I will just close with three recommendations to further strengthen the President's proposal. We strongly believe that we ought to create an Office of Fair Lending Compliance and Enforcement within the CFPA. Civil rights must be prioritized as part of the agency's formal structure. We ought to help consumers make smarter financial decisions. Go beyond the generic financial literacy and establish a federally funded financial counseling program. Improve data collection. Publicly available data, such as those available under HMDA, are valuable tools for holding financial institutions accountable. Communities of color were clearly targeted by lenders for inferior products, even when they had high incomes and good credit. Hispanic borrowers continue to face real barriers to accessing safe, fair, and affordable credit. We need strong regulators that allow borrowers fair and equal access to the banking system throughout their life cycle. Thank you, and I look forward to your questions. "
"The Chairman","Next, Mr. Plunkett. "
"STATEMENT OF TRAVIS B. PLUNKETT, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA"," "
"Mr. Plunkett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Ranking Member Hensarling. We have been asked to comment on the full range of regulatory restructuring proposals in the Administration's white papers, so I will offer comments on four key components of the plan. First, we support the Administration's fairly strong set of proposals on derivatives as an essential first step but urge you to strengthen it further by driving as much as possible of the over-the-counter derivatives market onto regulated exchanges. Second, the President's plan should offer much more robust reforms of credit rating regulations than it currently does. For example, reduce reliance on ratings by clarifying that using a credit rating does not afford a safe harbor. The investor, whether it is a pension fund, a bank, or a money market fund, must remain responsible for conducting their own evaluation to determine that the investment is appropriate. Our second recommendation on credit rating agencies is to increase rating agency accountability by eliminating the exemption from liability provided to rating agencies in the Securities Act. Our third recommendation for reform to the President's proposal on credit rating agencies is to strengthen oversight by providing either the SEC or an oversight board modeled on the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board the full complement of regulatory tools, including inspections, standard setting, and sanction authority. The regulators, however, should not pass judgment on rating methodologies. The third major component of the President's plan we are commenting on is the excellent proposals to strengthen protections for retail investors, in particular to create a fiduciary duty to act in the best interest of clients for investment advisors by proposing an examination and reform of the compensation practices that encourage financial professionals to act in ways that do not benefit their clients. We do have a recommendation here as well, though. We are concerned that the legislation as drafted leaves the SEC with too much leeway to adopt a watered-down fiduciary duty ``light'' that would deny vulnerable investors the protections they both need and deserve. The SEC has created this problem that has to be fixed, and so Congress is going to have to step in to tell them how to do this. Because, at least until now, they haven't been willing to do so on their own. Finally, we very strongly support the Administration's proposal to create a Federal consumer protection agency focused on credit, banking, and payment products, because it targets the most significant underlying causes of the massive regulatory failures that have led to harm for millions of Americans. Federal agencies did not make protecting consumers from lending abuses a priority, as you have heard repeatedly. They appeared to compete against each other to keep standards low and reduce oversight of financial institutions. They ignored many festering problems that grew worse over time. If agencies did act to protect consumers--and they often didn't--the process was cumbersome and time consuming. As a result, agencies did not act to stop some abusive lending practices until it was far too late. In short, regulators were not truly independent of the influence of the financial institutions they regulate. It is particularly important that the proposal would ensure that consumer protection oversight is no longer subjugated to safety and soundness regulation at regulatory agencies. Combining safety and soundness supervision with its focus on bank profitability in the same regulatory institutions as consumer protection magnified an ideological predisposition or anti-regulatory bias by Federal officials that led to unwillingness to rein in abusive lending before it triggered the housing and economic crisis. For example, why curb abusive credit card or overdraft lending that may be harming millions of consumers if it is boosting the bottom lines of the banks you are regulating? This is the inherent conflict that the objections I am hearing from the banking industry to this proposal don't really address. Regulators viewed, often, safety and soundness regulation as in conflict with consumer protection. We now know that, had they taken the side of consumers, they would have better protected the financial institutions they were charged with and consumers as well. Finally, let me just respond to some of the criticism we have heard by the financial industry. They are threatening broad-scale ``Harry and Louise'' type ads against this proposal. They have offered an elaborate defense of the status quo. They are minimizing the harm that the current regulatory regime has caused Americans, distorting specifics of the proposals and making the usual threats that improving consumer protection will increase costs and impede access to credit. Let me finish by saying we are in a credit crunch right now. We are in an economic crisis right now. The deregulatory regime that these institutions championed helped create that, and a consumer regulator will help move us away from that. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. "
"The Chairman","Mr. Taylor. "
"STATEMENT OF JOHN TAYLOR, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION (NCRC)"," "
"Mr. Taylor","Good morning, Chairman Frank, Representative Waters, and other distinguished members of the Committee on Financial Services. I am John Taylor, president and CEO of the National Community Reinvestment Coalition (NCRC). I am here representing 600 organizations from across the country, and my remarks reflect their views. The current crisis demonstrates the need for comprehensive regulatory reform and the establishment of a Federal agency focused on consumer protection. If we had adequate protection against predatory lending, then we would have not have had the current foreclosure crisis. The Administration asserts that consumer protection needs an independent seat at the table in our financial regulatory system and that the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, the CFPA, would be that independent seat. We couldn't agree more. NCRC strongly supports empowering the CFPA to administer and enforce all of the consumer protection and fair lending laws. In particular, we agree with the Administration that the CFPA must have jurisdiction over the Community Reinvestment Act. We urge the House Financial Services Committee to reinsert CRA under the CFPA in H.R. 1326. Currently, the bank regulatory agencies charged with enforcing the CRA have shown a feeble interest in enforcing this important legislation. Weakened enforcement and less frequent and thorough exams have been the norm. CRA grade inflation. Just so you understand, in 1990 to 1994, 8 percent of the financial institutions in this country failed the CRA exams, failed to accurately provide services and products to people of low- and moderate-income needs. That was between 1990 and 1994. From 2002 to 2007, a period of which we had the absolute worst lending where we really needed these lenders in these communities offering safe and sound and quality products, the CRA grades given by these regulators went down from 8 percent to 1 percent. Near absence of public hearings on mergers. We have had over the last 18 years all of 13 public hearings on mergers of CRA institutions. The opportunity for the public, for Members of Congress, for the press, and others to have a conversation about what this merger means for underserved communities, what the depositors and others who do business with the institutions need to see happen in the event these banks are merged, that process has been all but eliminated. The bank regulatory agencies have sat idly as they have seen a systematic bank withdrawal from low-income and communities of color. I mean, why is it that the basic banking of choice in minority and low-income communities is payday lenders, check cashers, and pawn shops? Because all these regulators sat by and allowed all those banking institutions to close those branches one after one after one after the next. By the way, in case you don't know this, we have gone from 15,000 financial institutions down to less than 10,000. In that same period of time, the number of branches has actually gone up but not in low-income and minority communities. And they were charged with enforcing that. Twenty-five percent of the CRA grade is supposed to be the servicing. What is the history of opening and closing branches? Where have the bank regulators been? Asleep at the helm. Even the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council--this Congress passed a law that required them to have a Consumer Advisory Counsel to advise the Fed board Governors. I had the honor of serving on that Council, but it astounded me to watch all these bankers appointed to the Consumer Advisory Council and then would be in these debates inside the Federal Reserve with bankers to give what is supposed to be a consumer perspective. Hello. And then, by the way, in case you don't know it, the Fed actually has a Bankers Council, made up of all bankers. Maybe one they will stop to invite consumers so that the banks will have to argue on them. When better attempts are made to enforce CRA by one agency, such as under the OCC when Eugene Ludwig was the Comptroller of the Currency, he actually really began to really take seriously CRA and the fair lending laws and to really enforce them, what happened? One hundred and twenty national banks changed their charter and went over to the Federal Reserve. So there is sort of this regulatory arbitrage. You don't like how they are enforcing law over here; go over here. OTS? Oh, gee, we will make a less frequent exam and we will go up to a billion dollars in assets, and we will say you don't really have to have the three exams. We will do a streamlined exam. There is enough history here. We don't have to doubt it. CRA is a stepchild regulation in these regulatory agencies. We couldn't need more now an agency that really for the first time takes a look at consumer interest, the taxpayer's interest, and assures that their rights are protected and that the Community Reinvestment Act is enforced. Let me--how am I doing for time? I still have some. Let me jump ahead and say a couple of things. We are very pleased that they have some enhanced data that I think will be very helpful to you, to us, and to others in looking at what banks do in underserved communities."
"The Chairman","Ten seconds."
"Mr. Taylor","Sorry, Mr. Chairman. This is a letter from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for allowing us to put this into evidence. These are--just in the last 2 days--hundreds of letters that are coming across the country endorsing CRA in this proposal. The NAACP's National Conference, La Raza, all of these leading civil rights organizations are supporting CRA. It has to be enforced. Thank you, sir. "
"The Chairman","Our final witness is Nancy Zirkin, on behalf of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights. "
"STATEMENT OF NANCY ZIRKIN, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE ON CIVIL RIGHTS (LCCR)"," "
"Ms. Zirkin","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. I am Nancy Zirkin, executive vice president of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR), the oldest and largest human and civil rights organization in this country comprised of 200 national organizations. We are also a part of the Americans for Financial Reform. LCCR supports a Consumer Financial Protection Agency because it is the key to protecting the civil rights of the communities that LCCR represents. Our interest ties into what has always been one of the key goals of the civil rights movement, homeownership, which is how most people build wealth and improve communities. LCCR and our member organizations have always worked to expand fair housing and also the credit that most people need to buy housing. Despite the progress since the Fair Housing Act, predatory lending has been the latest obstacle standing in the way, and, of course, it is very much the root of the crisis that we find ourselves in today. For years, LCCR and our allies argued that the modern lending system was working against us. Just to be clear, responsible subprime lending is a good thing. The problem is that the industry basically threw the responsible out of the window by giving countless numbers of people loans that weren't realistic or responsible. Even worse, many lenders were steering racial and ethnic minorities into these loans, even when they could have qualified for conventional loans. So, for years, civil rights and consumer advocates have tried to get help from Federal banking regulators, but they ignored us and maintained the status quo. Seemingly, they were more persuaded by the industry's platitudes about access to credit than the growing evidence of what the credit was actually doing. Since 1994, for example, the Fed has been able to ban predatory loans but waited until a year ago to actually start doing so, after most predatory lenders had already skipped down and left taxpayers holding the bag. The OTS and OCC were no better, even when it came to enforcing civil rights laws like the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. During the housing bubble years, neither regulator referred cases to the Department of Justice. In one instance, DOJ had to go after an OTS thrift on its own, Mid-America Bank. I have attached a new brief by the Center for Responsible Lending to my written statement which will be added to the record. The brief contains a lot of compelling horror stories about the lack of financial enforcement. And we all know about the Treasury Inspector General's report on IndyMac, which certainly shows what OTS did--or didn't do, I should say. The problem with relying on Federal bank regulators to protect our communities is simple. Its structure is inherently designed to fail consumers. When regulators are financially dependent on the institutions that they police, consumer interest will always be squeezed out. CFPA will break this pattern. In the same way that our Founders realized that sometimes you have to deliberately pick interests against each other in order to create a stable government, the interest of consumers and civil rights on the one hand and bank profitability on the other need to be pitted against each other. It is obvious that the current system didn't serve either interest. That is why LCCR thinks your legislation, Mr. Chairman, is so important. Speaking of details, my written testimony includes recommendations to the bill that we think are essential, and also LCCR's Fair Housing Task Force has a series of recommendations that we will be sharing. Again, thank you for inviting LCCR here today; and I will be happy to answer any questions you might have. Thank you. "
"The Chairman","Thank you. I will begin. Mr. Ireland, you were at the Fed. In 1994, this Congress passed a law, the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, giving the Fed the authority to take action restricting abusive mortgages, irresponsible mortgages. Nothing happened until Mr. Bernanke became chairman and this committee actually--after the current majority took over--began to act on it, was promulgated. Can you explain why for that period, from 1994 until 1995 to 2007, the Federal Reserve did not act on it? Do you recall any conversations about why that should or shouldn't happen?"
"Mr. Ireland","I don't recall any conversations on that specific issue."
"The Chairman","That is the specific issue I am asking about. So that is the answer. You are not aware of any conversations about whether or not to enforce that--what was your position at the Fed?"
"Mr. Ireland","I was an Associate General Counsel in the Legal Division."
"The Chairman","So if this was to be implemented, would that have come under your purview?"
"Mr. Ireland","It would have come to the Board. We would have looked at it--"
"The Chairman","So, apparently, there was not even any interest in doing it. And the question is, in general, is it your impression that consumer issues like this--Truth in Lending, the Homeowners Equity Protection Act, other areas that the Fed had--did they get equal attention at the Federal Reserve with other regulatory duties?"
"Mr. Ireland","They got insufficient attention."
"The Chairman","They got insufficient attention. Thank you. And I would say this now: It is not simply ideological. Sure, there is an ideology. But there is both an ideology and an institutional role, and I do not think that it is purely personal that they got insufficient attention. When you give people a lot of responsibility, they can do some, but they can't do them all equally. I think it is very clear that that is the explanation, that they--as you acknowledge, and I appreciate--got insufficient attention because the primary mission was seen as other. Now, I do want to address in this time what I think is an inaccurate analogy between the Fannie and Freddie situation and this one. People have said, well, after all, you had OFHEO and you had HUD and HUD overruled OFHEO. By the way, I agree with that. In 2004, when Secretary Jackson in the Bush Administration ordered Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to substantially increase the number of subprime mortgages they bought, I objected. I said at the time--quoted in Bloomberg--that it was a mistake. That was not a favor to these people to push them into these mortgages. My own view consistently was that we should have been doing more rental housing. I was frustrated that we couldn't get enough of that. And, by the way, when you talk about the housing goals, it was the home purchases for people who couldn't afford it rather than rental housing that were the cause of these problems. But here is the point. Everybody agreed by then that OFHEO was too weak a regulator. In fact, in 2005, this committee did recommend a change. Now, many of those critical of Fannie and Freddie opposed the change. Mr. Oxley, looking down on us, put the bill through. There was then a dispute among the Republicans in the House, the Republicans in the Senate, and the President. I must say I am flattered by those who think that I somehow was the arbiter of this intra-Republican dispute and that I was responsible for the outcome. Would that I was responsible for mediating Republican disputes. We wouldn't be in Iraq today. But that is another story. In any case, what we had was, in 2007, the passage out of this committee and onto the Floor of the House a tough regulator. And, in fact, people have said, where is your regulation of Fannie and Freddie? Well, the fact is that we did pass the regulation. Unfortunately, in the United States Senate, it was bogged down. It didn't pass until 2008. But people have said, how can you do this without doing Fannie and Freddie? Well, one of the key points that the Bush Administration wanted was to put it into conservatorship. We have done that. The Fannie and Freddie today is nothing like what it was before in part because too long had gone by without legislation and in part because of the legislation we adopted. But the point is this: The weakness of OFHEO--in fact, people have said, well, see, you had a consumer regulator, HUD, and a safety and soundness regulator, OFHEO, and that caused the problem. But the very people making that argument are the ones who argued that OFHEO was too weak a safety and soundness regulator. They explicitly, in fact, disavowed the comparison between OFHEO and the OCC and the Fed. In other words, it is not the case that we tried having a separate safety and soundness regulator and a separate consumer regulator. Those making the argument today argued correctly that OFHEO was not in the class of OCC, was not in the class. At first, I didn't think it had to be. I later changed my mind by 2005 and thought it should be because of these subprime mortgages. But the argument that because we had an OFHEO and a HUD that means you can't do these together misses the point that the big problem was not that you had a separate consumer and safety and soundness regulator but that the safety and soundness regulator was too weak. And people who argued again that it was not comparable to the bank regulators can't use that now as an analogy. I think we have tough bank regulation, and I think we can have a system in which we also get tough consumer regulation. The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Clearly, the thrust of the Administration's plan and as illustrated by the chairman's bill is that financial service firms produce--I think the Administration used this phrase-- plain vanilla products. Is everybody in favor of the concept that financial firms produce at least one plain vanilla product? Is that something--is anybody against that? I assume that means everybody supports it?"
"Ms. Zirkin","Well, if I could comment on that, Mr. Hensarling. We are in favor of having transparency. We are in favor of having a menu of options. Alt-A mortgages were not a menu of options."
"Mr. Hensarling","So you are a Baskin-Robbins kind of--"
"Ms. Zirkin","We believe that it won't necessarily be only plain vanilla, but the consumers must have a choice."
"Mr. Hensarling","Well, if you end up essentially saying that you have a semi-safe harbor for a plain vanilla product and you don't for any other product--we had testimony here just yesterday of a number of banks, including our community banks, that you want to have step-up lending, saying they are not going to roll out new products because they fear that these products will be found unlawful. At least all the people who are in production of the ice cream, the financial ice cream, are saying, you know what? The incentive structure is we are going to produce plain vanilla. So if the impact--I know how it may look to you on the drawing board, but if the impact is we end up with plain vanilla products after--assuming this legislation passes--would it change your mind about the legislation?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Mr. Hensarling, I don't think that will be the impact. The stated goal and the obvious goal is to encourage choice."
"Mr. Hensarling","I appreciate that. But, again, there is testimony that is different. Then I would ask the question, what exactly is a plain vanilla product? I had my staff go online, and they pulled up hundreds and hundreds of recipes for plain vanilla ice cream, the first one being Thomas Jefferson's handwritten ice cream recipe. Apparently, the President didn't have terribly good penmanship. I have a hard time reading it. I have one vanilla ice cream recipe calling for egg whites. I have another ice cream recipe calling for egg yolks. I have an ice cream recipe, vanilla ice cream, calling for whole milk. I have one calling for Eagle Brand milk. Here is one for half- and-half. One calls for vanilla extract, another for vanilla beans, and the list goes on. My point is, number one, not even--not even can you define precisely what is a plain vanilla product. People are different in this Nation. And so now, because people have trouble with subprime mortgages, all of a sudden we are going to create this huge government leviathan which is going to have the opportunity to ban types of mortgage loan, personal loans, car loans. They will have the ability to now regulate loan servicing, check cashing, debt collection, and the list goes on and on. Well, let me ask you this. Some people will say, okay, here is a plain vanilla product. Credit cards used to be plain vanilla products. Now they are very complicated entities. But when I look back at a plain vanilla credit card product 20, 30 years ago, it was one that charged an annual fee, 25, 35, 40 bucks. There was no cash back. There were no frequent flyer miles. Everybody paid the same high interest rates, far higher than today. Is that the kind of product that your members would like to have?"
"Mr. Taylor","Mr. Hensarling, if I may, I think your assumption is wrong, and your analogy to food is wrong. All that is being asked here is that you take the laws that Congress has passed and make sure that there is an agency that protects consumers and enforces those laws."
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Taylor, it is my time. But, with all due respect, you are giving an agency the power to ban products, taking away consumer choice. How do you protect the consumer by taking away their choice? You may disagree, but others believe that you will squash innovation. We will not see the next ATM. We will not see the next set of frequent flyer miles. And so if you think that the members of your organizations are having trouble getting credit now, wait until this legislation is passed, and then you will see real problems. I see my time is up. I yield back."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Yesterday, in talking with representatives of the banking community, we were admonished for not supporting adjustable rate mortgages. And basically what they said is, you guys don't understand adjustable rate mortgages and how they have helped so many people. It is the same argument we get a lot when people say we don't understand subprime lending. We have never said we are against subprime lending, but there are so many iterations on the subjects. I would like to ask--perhaps you could help me, Mr. Mierzwinski--for a definition of these adjustable rate mortgages. As I understand it, there are option ARMs, and there are products that could reset 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, and when the mortgage is negotiated--and many of these adjustable rate mortgages. They don't look at whether or not the homeowner will be able to afford the mortgage 1 year or 5 months or 5 years from the time that they sign on to these mortgages. And the formula for the increase possibly in interest rates allows something called a margin on top of the interest rates. So you could have an increase in interest rate, plus they can mark up this mortgage another 2, 3, 4 percent. Could you help us with a description of the harmful adjustable rate mortgages?"
"Mr. Mierzwinski","Well, Congresswoman, I would say you have exactly identified the problem, and the new agency would have the opportunity to hold hearings on and to regulate some of the most unfair aspects of these mortgages. As you pointed out, people were qualified based on their ability to make the payments only in the first year, not after the option kicked in, the so-called 2/28s or the 3/27s, and the regulators looked the other way. We want a regulator that will look at the product, and we want a regulator who will then say certain aspects of this product, not the product itself necessarily, should be made illegal. We regulate toasters to make sure they don't catch fire. We are not banning toasters with the Consumer Product Safety Commission, and we are not banning adjustable rate mortgages with the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. We are simply saying they have to be safe and we want the innovations to be within the circle of safe products."
"Ms. Waters","And, again, when many of these adjustable rate mortgages reset, this margin that they put on top of, what I understand, the existing interest rates could be flexible in terms of how much they charge. They could be 2 percent, 3 percent, 4 percent. Are you familiar with that?"
"Mr. Mierzwinski","Congresswoman, I am generally familiar with that, and I can say, again, that there may be unfair aspects as to the way that the margins reset, the way that they are disclosed to consumers and the calculation of what the consumer's interest rate and monthly payment will be and how often that they can change. And that is really something that the current regulators have not had been on top of. They just absolutely have not been on top of it. There is a Wild West out there, if you will, and that is why we are looking for a new agency to tame the Wild West."
"Ms. Waters","Mr. Ireland, you talked about the complications of creating such an agency and you talked about vertically integrated markets in harmonization, whatever that is. But I want to know about Alt-A loans, because I am very interested in regulation of these products that I think have been so harmful to our homeowners. Would you discuss for me Alt-A loans and why they must be regulated, what went wrong with them, and how they were misused?"
"Mr. Ireland","The classic Alt-A loan is something called a no-doc loan, and it is a loan where you do not obtain the same kind of documentation as to income and ability to repay that you would on a conventional mortgage. And in a limited number of circumstances that may make sense because of the nature-- somebody who is self-employed and the nature of the business that they are in. The problem we had is that kind of loan was offered to a great many more people than it was appropriate for, and we had a proliferation of no-doc loans. My father-in-law got a no-doc loan, and he had no business with it. We eventually had to bail him out of his mortgage. So I think you had a product with a limited use that was being misused by the lenders who were offering it."
"Ms. Waters","Did any of the regulators say anything about that product being misused?"
"Mr. Ireland","There was regulatory guidance issued, and I think some of the Federal regulators have admitted somewhat late in the process about how to address Alt-A and other unconventional mortgage products. That probably should have been done sooner rather than the time it was introduced."
"Ms. Waters","And would you conclude that is typical of what regulators did not do?"
"Mr. Ireland","I think regulators were behind the curve on a number of consumer issues, particularly the mortgage issue."
"Ms. Waters","And that is why we need some kind of consumer protection. Would you agree?"
"Mr. Ireland","I would agree that we need to enhance consumer protection. I don't think this agency is the best way to do that."
"Ms. Waters","All right. Thank you very much."
"Mr. Plunkett","Madam Chairwoman, on Alt-A loans, one thing we heard yesterday from the banks was a lot of finger pointing. They said, we didn't create these problems. But we do know that the national banks regulated by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency did issue a lot of Alt-A loans that do have very high default rates."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much. Mr. Posey?"
"Mr. Posey","Thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman. The far-reaching tentacles of the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency would appear to have almost completely unfettered jurisdiction over advertisement, marketing, solicitation, sale, disclosure, delivery or account maintenance or supervising of deposit taking activities, extension of credit, loan acquisition, brokering or servicing, real estate appraisal, title insurance, credit insurance, mortgage insurance, real estate insurance, services including title insurance, leasing of personnel or real property, acting as an agent, broker or advisor in such activity, credit reporting services, guaranteed check services, money transaction, business services, stored value instruments, i.e., debt cards, certain financial data processing, transmission of storage services, debt collection services, investment service not subject to SEC or CTFC regulations, financial advisory services, credit counseling or tax planning or preparation, financial management advice, financial custodial services, and numerous other financial activity related services specifically identified by some rule that they would develop, which my staff has not been able to ascertain yet because that remains unclear. And so, to paraphrase in another context exactly what Congressman Hensarling said before, just what exactly is acceptable? Or do we want this agency to list every possible transaction in detail that is acceptable and then figure out every possible transaction and list it in detail as being unacceptable? I mean, do we want to turn into omnipresent defenders of nonexistent problems not suffered by 90 percent of the people? I mean, can't we focus a little bit better on precisely maybe a standard of care that should be offered by somebody who is in these positions of fiduciary relationships with clients, rather than kind of turning the entire business world upside down to try and so broadly brush the choices that people have? And I see all of you anxiously jumping for your buttons. Mr. Plunkett, if you could take a minute, and then we will give Mr. Taylor a minute."
"Mr. Plunkett","Thank you. For the most part, the new agency doesn't get new authority. They get new authority in one area, but this is an authority that exists under 17 existing laws or is very similar to unfair and deceptive acts and practices authority the Federal Trade Commission has or it is regulated at the State level. It is mostly a consolidation. It is a streamlining, actually. It is not a new layer of bureaucracy at all. And it is a minimum standard of the States, where necessary--and I think in many cases they won't find necessary--could exceed if there is a local problem."
"Mr. Posey","You don't anticipate any new rules being written?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Well, I think the idea is that, first and foremost, it will do research. It will be focused solely on consumer protection, and rules should follow good empirical knowledge of the marketplace. If we had had that on subprime loans, for example, we might have seen some rulemaking earlier on."
"Mr. Taylor","I agree. I think all you are talking about is having a consumer protection agency that essentially enforces the laws that this Congress and various Congresses and Presidents have signed. Yes, there will be rulemaking, as there is for any other agency, but this Congress as well will have an impact on that if you perceive that they go too far or not too far. I mean, that is the way the system works. This notion--"
"Mr. Posey","Now, let me just say--the question that begs for an answer--back to Mr. Plunkett's response. Why do we expect a new agency of bureaucrats to do the exact same jobs he said that 17 agencies of bureaucrats have failed to do properly before? What is it about this new brand of bureaucrat that we are going to have that--instead of looking for a job description, they are going to actually do a job?"
"Mr. Taylor","Fair question. And I think the difference is you will actually have an agency whose primary focus is to ensure that the American taxpayer, the consumers, their interests are protected, as opposed to worrying about the bank or worrying about--"
"Mr. Posey","So in the sake of streamlining, as Mr. Plunkett said, do you agree then that if we have this new agency with these all-inclusive powers, which are really just powers previously delegated to other agencies, we can now get rid of the other 17 agencies?"
"Mr. Taylor","No. They have other functions to serve. Obviously, the bank regulators, monetary policy, safety and soundness and other very important roles to play. But, clearly, this has been the stepchild of legislation. That is why we had all this predatory and abusive lending, and that is what this is aimed to stop. And I just want to, for Mr. Hensarling as well, none of us are opposed to competition. I think competition will remain robust. But we should have a free market that has a rule of law in it that ensures fairness and doesn't allow for a free market that is free to abuse and free to fraud and free to do things that hurt consumers, and I think that is what this agency gets at."
"Mr. Posey","And I think we agree, but somebody needs to define pure vanilla. And the agencies that have those authorities now--thank you for your indulgence, Madam Chairwoman--should be capable of doing that, we think."
"Mr. Taylor","I wish that were true, sir."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you. Mr. Mel Watt."
"Mr. Watt","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. We were down here debating which one of us was more or less prepared. So let me start by commercializing a little bit to let all of the members of the committee know that this afternoon at 2:00 there is going to be another one of these hearings focused primarily on the consumer protection, financial protection agency as it relates to taking powers away from the Federal Reserve and transferring them to this new agency. And while I don't normally do this, because I think this, obviously, will be part of the record in the subcommittee this afternoon, I did want to offer for the record a statement that has been prepared by Patricia A. McCoy, Director of the Insurance Law Center, and George and Helen England Professor of Law at the University of Connecticut School of Law, that more concisely than anyplace I have seen goes back and talks about the regulatory history in which we are operating, how we ended up with this race to the bottom, as opposed to having true regulation, the regulatory failure of the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the OTS and how the race to the bottom kind of encouraged banks or other regulated institutions to seek the least common denominator and how this new consumer protection agency, financial protection agency would probably address this in the best way. So if I can get unanimous consent to submit that for the record and encourage my colleagues to read it, it is one of the best summaries of this I think I have seen."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Watt. Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. Watt","Now, we had a hearing on this yesterday from the financial services industry perspective, and one thing I did come away convinced of was that, to the extent that you leave consumer protection in the existing regulatory agencies responsibility, any responsibility for it, and take part of the responsibility and give it to this new consumer protection agency, there is possibility for conflict between the existing regulators and the new agency. Now, their solution to that was not to create the new agency. My solution to it is not to leave any of the responsibility over on the existing regulators' side or to be absolutely clear on what that relationship is. So I would like, not here today, but for you all to go back and look at the interplay between what we are leaving over there on the consumer protection side in the existing regulatory agencies and what we are giving to this new agency so that we make sure that the possibility of conflicts that so many people have complained about don't exist in the consumer protection area. Do that outside the context of this hearing. Mr. Ireland, the other thing I keep hearing is that there is this potential for conflict between consumer protection responsibilities and safety and soundness regulators, even if you separate these things. Give me one example of where there would be a conflict between the consumer protection person or agency and an existing regulator on safety and soundness."
"Mr. Ireland","Well, you can--"
"Mr. Watt","One concrete example. No theory. Just give me one example where you see that would happen."
"Mr. Ireland","I think the State of Georgia's predatory landing law--"
"Mr. Watt","I am talking about in our Federal structure. Give me one example where that would be a problem."
"Mr. Ireland","In our Federal structure today, those responsibilities are carried out in the same agencies, and they have--"
"Mr. Watt","I understand that, Mr. Ireland. That is not what I am asking. I am asking--I keep hearing that there is this potential for conflict between a consumer protection agency and the safety and soundness agency. And I don't understand that. Tell me one example where that would play itself out."
"Mr. Ireland","With all due respect, I can give you a hypothetical example you asked for."
"Mr. Watt","No. I want a real example, because we are operating in the real world here."
"Mr. Ireland","I offered you a real example."
"Mr. Watt","We have had all of these things operating in the same agencies and people keep telling me that there is this amazing conflict between consumer protection or a potential for conflict between a consumer protection agency and safety and soundness regulator. I don't see it. And I don't--I just want you to give me an example."
"Mr. Ireland","If I, as a consumer protection agency, create a mortgage that can't be securitized, I have a problem."
"Ms. Waters","I would love for you to have an opportunity to pursue this, Mr. Watt. The time is up. Give him time to think about it, and before this hearing is over, he can help you."
"Mr. Watt","We are going to explore that issue at my hearing this afternoon."
"Ms. Waters","Mr. Paulsen?"
"Mr. Paulsen","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And maybe one of the areas we could discuss a little bit, you could certainly go into Freddie and Fannie a little bit if you want to talk about where there is some potential issues there that the gentleman was just talking about. Let me ask you this, Mr. Ireland. The Fed has often been criticized for not acting or acting too slowly in missing or issuing, implementing regulations for consumer protection on credit cards, on mortgages, etc., etc. Warren Buffet once said that the troubles of the mortgage market that you mentioned, it is only when the tide goes out that you discover who is swimming naked. And is it reasonable to think that a Consumer Financial Protection Agency--is it really reasonable to think that they would be able to assess the future risks of consumer financial products any better than the Federal Reserve or any other present regulatory agency if there is to have that focus?"
"Mr. Ireland","I think structurally the anticipation would be they would not do as good a job. They do not have access to the same kind of information."
"Mr. Plunkett","It is not rocket science. There was evidence 10 years ago that subprime mortgages were defaulting at a higher rate than regular mortgages. If those agencies had bothered to look, do research that was available in the public realm, if it was a priority, they could have done it. That is why we need an agency focused just on consumer protection."
"Mr. Paulsen","Going back to what Mr. Posey had mentioned earlier, he talked about the 17 different commissions or agencies that were charged with this. And it is interesting as I talked to one of my banks back home--and I just have this one chart and it lists a number of the regulatory burdens and I am not going to read every one as he had gone through each of these agencies that they have to deal with. But it is extremely frustrating I think for a lot of these organizations, because we hear about the frustrating flow of credit that has to go to small businesses for job creation, which we don't see happening right now. And this chart clearly shows and illustrates the burden that is posed on hundreds--or hundreds of these regulations that are posed and many of which are already dealing with consumer protection agencies. So I understand the goal of having it be smart, having it be strategic to make sure these consumers are protected, but I am not convinced that, at least given the details that have yet to emerge on this one, the devil is in the details, that we are going to be able actually fix this; and, if anything, I think we are going to be able to potentially make it worse. If a bank is engaged in unscrupulous lending, we need to find them out. Safety and soundness, most critical, and that should be the focus I think of all regulation. What I would like to do is actually yield my time to Mr. Hensarling, if I could, because I know he had one follow-up question."
"Mr. Hensarling","I thank the gentleman for yielding. And the gentleman did cover one point when my colleague from North Carolina was searching for an example. I mean, nobody has to look past the fact that HUD had product approval, consumer protection for the GSEs. We had somebody else to serve as the safety and soundness regulator. Now we have the mother of all bailouts."
"Mr. Plunkett","Mr. Hensarling, that example doesn't really work."
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Plunkett, you do not control the time here. Thank you very much. And I don't think anybody has asked you a question at the moment, but I am sure that someone else will give you an opportunity to speak. So, with all due respect, I believe, as do many others, that, frankly, it is a perfect analogy and one why we think it is very harmful, very harmful inclusion in this legislation. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I will ask another question, unless the gentleman wants his time back. Ms., is it ``Murguia?''"
"Ms. Murguia","Yes."
"Mr. Hensarling","I had a question for you. In your testimony, I believe you spoke about the Hispanic community needing access to credit for economic upward mobility--I don't want to put words in your mouth. That is essentially, I believe, what you said--and that there is essentially a disparate overpayment by many racial minorities on certain credit products. Under the legislation that is being proposed, the white paper--the White House says that, ``the CFPA should be authorized to use a variety of measures to help ensure alternative mortgages were obtained only by consumers who understand the risk and can manage them.'' Assuming that is the Obama Administration that wrote this paper who would end up appointing the five panel members, this seems to open the door to having one group of consumers being authorized to have one type of mortgage and another group of consumers being authorized to have another. Is that not a type of discrimination and does that not trouble you?"
"Ms. Murguia","I certainly didn't interpret it that way. I think what we are saying is that there are clearly disparities that data can support in the system today. We believe this agency will help bring more focus, and we are really looking at a commonsense standard here. And that is the system is very complicated and far too complex for even the savviest of consumers to navigate and many rely on professionals to help them navigate these systems and many still trust and have trusted their loan officers, brokers, and realtors. All we are asking for is that there be some standard of accountability, some standard of oversight, some standard of transparency to make sure that we can have equal enforcement here and lessen that disparity."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you. And I thank the gentleman for yielding."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you. Mr. Gutierrez?"
"Mr. Gutierrez","Thank you so much. First of all, I have a question for the entire panel, and I would like a simple yes or no, since I only have 5 minutes. I would like to ask you, would you support nonbank financial institutions being subjected to the Community Reinvestment Act after we establish the CFPA? Just a quick yes or no."
"Ms. Murguia","Yes."
"Mr. Flatley","Yes."
"Mr. Ireland","I don't know how you do that."
"Mr. Gutierrez","Okay. You don't know how you do that."
"Mr. Flatley","Yes."
"Ms. Murguia","Yes."
"Mr. Plunkett","Yes."
"Mr. Taylor","Most definitely."
"Ms. Zirkin","Yes."
"Mr. Gutierrez","Well, thank you. I just wanted to-- And I want to say to my friend, Janet Murguia, as you know, we have been working for nearly a decade on the basic Federal consumer protections and disclosures for remittance consumers. I think with the CFPA, we have an opportunity to finally put those protections in place. And I just want to ask you, do you support the idea of giving the CFPA jurisdiction over consumer protection aspects of the remittance industry?"
"Ms. Murguia","Well, I think that we--we have never--I am trying to remember in terms of that."
"Mr. Gutierrez","They don't have a Federal regulator right now."
"Ms. Murguia","We need some oversight on remittances. We would like to see some ability to regulate that area, and we are very interested in making sure someone will take a look at that. So I think this would be a good place for that to happen."
"Mr. Gutierrez","What I am going to try to do with the help of others is see if we can't, in the context of this bill, put those protections in so that they are already authorized to do that and to cover that. And they have a Federal-- I want to say to--I have so many friends up here. I want to say to my other friends, to Travis Plunkett and Mr. Mierzwinski, thank you. It is great working with both of you on the Credit Card Bill of Rights. I look forward to working with you on other successful consumer advocacy issues. I want to make it clear for the record, you know, that we are friends, we are allies, that we work together. Disclosure is always the best policy, transparency. So I want to ask you both, both of your organizations have indicated on several occasions that anything short of a 36 percent usury cap on all loan products would be ineffective; and many times representatives from the CFA have touted President Obama's support of a 36 percent rate cap. But, unfortunately, the language the White House sent to Congress explicitly prohibits the CFPA from implementing usury caps without legislation requiring such caps. So, contrary to all our hopes and expectations, the Administration essentially has handed the issue back to Congress. Do you both agree with that basic statement? Do both of you, Mr. Plunkett and Mr. Mierzwinski?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Yes."
"Mr. Mierzwinski","That is correct."
"Mr. Gutierrez","So we all know that to get it, it has to come from Congress. But aside from the 36 percent cap for pay loans for military families, which for the record started with my amendment in this very committee, Congress has not had an appetite for passing usury caps. As an aside, I met yesterday--I had an opportunity to meet with an Australian senator who also serves as the assistant treasurer in the current government, and we discussed payday lending there at length. And he indicated to me that they have put caps of 48 percent, and the payday industry has somehow gotten around them. He indicated that rate caps alone have not adequately dealt with the payday industry in Australia, and so he says they just simply extend the terms of the loan. But what they will be doing soon is experimenting with an ability to pay standard in conjunction with a rate cap. So I would like to ask both of you, do you think it is a good idea for the CFPA to look at and implement ability to pay standards for products such as this industry?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. That is at the essence of what this agency should be doing."
"Mr. Gutierrez","So you agree?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Yes, sir."
"Mr. Gutierrez","I am sorry. Since this is only 5 minutes and I want to coordinate my work in 2 weeks during this 5 minutes right here--"
"Mr. Plunkett","I would just add, on a lot of different credit products."
"Mr. Gutierrez","Agreed. On a lot of different credit that we should--this ability to pay issue is a really big one. Let us just assume for a second that this fine committee and the House doesn't adopt the 36 percent cap, which doesn't say we are not. Maybe we will have the ability to do that and get members here to do what the Senate has failed to do. Do you think in terms of payday lending--I want to ask both of you, would you support a ban on rollovers for payday lenders, eliminate any rollovers for payday lenders?"
"Mr. Plunkett","We supported rollover bans and restrictions. That have just been--"
"Mr. Gutierrez","I am sorry. I just wanted--if I could just have 30 seconds? Just unanimous consent?"
"Mr. Mierzwinski","I would agree that the rollover bans have been evaded. But this agency might be able to figure out a way. Even if it is not given the usury cap right, unless Congress adds it in, this agency might be able to figure out a solution to that."
"Mr. Gutierrez","So I just wanted--because it is 30 seconds. You see how 5 minutes goes. When you try to help consumers, 5 minutes are less than 5 minutes, and they go fast. Anyway, so I have 30 seconds. So I want to say, so I would like you guys to, please, if you can put in writing yes or no, maybe we should extend the payment plan from 2 weeks to 3 or 4 months instead of 2 weeks back. Maybe we should set a national registry so you can only have one payday loan at a time and you can't have two, and we can start--and a database to enforce that. So that, in essence, if we cannot get this 36 percent, which I know is the standard, which both of your organizations have established but that we know the President hasn't promoted here, isn't in his bill, but we are going to see if we can get--I want to see what other things we can do in the interim period to help consumers."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you. Mr. Royce?"
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I think if we reflect for a minute, it was in 1992 that the GSE Act was passed by the Democrat side of this institution, and that GSE Act started the affordable housing goals. That was the legislation that basically set up a system and HUD did the mission enforcement on this in which Fannie and Freddie went out and bought subprime loans and Alt-A loans in order--in order to meet that requirement. Now, we all know that OFHEO was a weak regulator, but I don't think that is the point. I mean, HUD was a strong regulator here, and HUD was enforcing this mission, and in point of fact when we tried to do something about it--and I specifically carried legislation on the House Floor in 2005 to try to allow OFHEO to become a stronger regulator, to allow them to do what the Fed wanted them to do, which was to deleverage these portfolios. Because, at the time, they said, this is a systemic risk to the entire financial system globally because of what is happening with the GSEs being leveraged over 100 to 1. So this was the desire by the regulators who saw the problem. But HUD did not see that problem, and our colleagues didn't see that problem. The GSE example highlights the inherent conflict of interest that arises when you bifurcate these regulatory responsibilities as they were bifurcated between HUD on one side and OFHEO on the other; and this is why all of our safety and soundness regulators, every one of them, have expressed concern over the idea being put forward in this legislation. The altruistic yet misguided affordable housing goals put Fannie and Freddie at risk; and, yes, indeed, as the Fed said, it put the financial system at risk by 2005 because of the political interference in this process that pushed those downpayments down to 3 percent, to zero percent. You had 30 percent of the loans that year being people who were flipping homes, never taking possession of those homes, pushing that market up, up, up, ballooning that market up, up, up. And, yes, the Fed saw that coming, and we weren't able to do anything about it because of the political pressure to prevent an effective regulator from taking the action necessary. And this wasn't realized I think by the general public until after the mortgage meltdown. You task a separate agency with this mission, then you have to expect that altruistic policies, seemingly altruistic policies that they put in place are going to lead to unintended consequences because the market isn't deciding these factors anymore. This is being decided by political pull. This is being decided by political interference in the market, which is exactly what happened. Now, Mr. Ireland, we have the commentary of Sheila Bair, head of the FDIC, against this approach of this separate agency. John Dugan, head of the OCC, against it. James Lockhart, FHFA, he is against this step. Donald Kohn, the Fed's Vice Chairman, strongly against this step. They have all expressed concern over this idea. Why do you think that is?"
"Mr. Ireland","Well, I think that, as I said in my testimony, the issues of safety and soundness and the issues of consumer protection are not separate issues. You are trying to deliver good products, and by separating the functions you tend to frustrate that. Mr. Watt asked for an example. If you go back to the 1970's, fixed rate mortgages and a rising interest rate environment were a very dangerous product for the safety and soundness of financial institutions. And if you have an agency, a consumer protection agency that creates a preference for fixed-rate 30-year mortgages, you have a safety and soundness problem if interest rates rise over time and institutions have to fund themselves at higher rates than they are earning on those mortgages."
"Mr. Royce","Now let me raise another concern I have here, and that is, with the legal liability exposure for businesses, that really would be on a massive scale. Right now, we have 95 percent of the lawsuits worldwide filed here. Maybe we can get it up to 99 percent. Maybe we could. Mr. Ireland, here are some of the highlights? It applies a new and high reasonableness standard for the sale of financial products to consumers. It leaves open the potential for an increase in statutory damages for existing private rights of action. It applies a duty of care for financial products. Is it good for the buyer, in other words. It recommends the elimination of mandatory arbitrary provisions in consumer financial products and broker/dealer investment contracts. Do you share any of my concerns with the amount of litigation that is going to come out of this?"
"Mr. Ireland","I think that the people who are most likely to benefit from this law as originally drafted are the lawyers."
"Mr. Mierzwinski","Madam Chairwoman, can I quickly respond? I just want to say that the mandatory arbitration--the Attorney General of Minnesota filed a lawsuit against an arbitration mill this week where she alleged all kinds of violations of the existing consumer laws and that the company was essentially in bed with the banks and tricking consumers into signing forced arbitration contracts. The mandatory--the statutory damages in current law were written in 1968 and have been exceeded by inflation by about 5 times. This is not going to benefit the lawyers. This is going to benefit the public."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you. Mr. Meeks?"
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. First of all, I want to agree with Ms. Zirkin, who stated in her statement that I am not against subprime loans that are responsible. Those kinds of loans can help individuals own a home, which I still believe is the greatest opportunity for wealth creation that we have and will lower the gap between those who own and don't have, particularly in regards to African Americans, Latinos, etc. The problem comes in is where the responsibility leaves, and we get into areas of predatory loans. And I think for a long period of time many individuals, on this side of the aisle, at any rate, were yelling and screaming that we should ban predatory lending because predatory lending put many of the individuals in the situations that they are currently in. Now, if it is someone who is flipping homes, that is a whole different person. We are talking about individuals who bought these homes, trying to participate in the great American dream of homeownership so they can raise their kids for a long period of time. And, to me, what we are simply trying to do here is to say, yes, we have to have safety and soundness regulations, but we also have to have someplace to go where there may be some predatory lending going on. This consumer regulatory agency can overlook and can oversee what is going on so we can make sure that the product is not having a negative impact overall. For example, there is a debate that is going on as to whether or not--you know, yield spread premiums. From my idea, we should ban yield spread premiums, because I don't see what the utilization of them are except for costing individuals more money. Now, it would seem to me that we could debate that. Because on one side, if you just leave it to the bankers and the financial institutions who--they are--part of their role is to try to make as much money as they can. But we need someone else whose role is to try to make sure that we are not doing it at the backs or at the expense of other individuals. And I think what the President's plan is simply trying to do is say, let us lay it out. And what I would think that--I had hoped yesterday and what I may comment to those who testified yesterday is, as opposed to people lining up dead set against something, I think it helps them. It would help their image if they came with some recommendations on how we could make sure consumers are also protected. Because one of the biggest problems in America right now is it is us against them, and we need to find a way to bridge that gap. And, to me, it makes sense that this is an avenue to bridge that gap so Main Street doesn't think that Wall Street is against them. But if anytime you talk about something of that nature without saying, well, here is my recommendations, how we can work it again, then it looks like Wall Street is against Main Street. And we have to figure out how we bridge that. I thought that Ms. Zirkin's testimony was right on the money in that regard. I think that is the direction we need to go in. I think that the conversation that we also need to have is--because I heard some say it needs to be an independent agency. And it gets to the question of how do we pay for it. Should it be a situation where there is a direct appropriation from Congress? Should it be by fee? Who--I hadn't heard that. Let me just throw that out. Anyone have any recommendation of how we should pay for it?"
"Mr. Plunkett","It is a really crucial question, Congressman. What the Administration has proposed is a good start. First, they allow congressional appropriations but say that the main business of the agency should be funded by industry assessments. What they see happening is that those assessments which are now going to the other banking regulators would then be applied to this agency and so there would not be additional costs. The consumer groups thinks there needs to be a mix of funding so that the agency is not reliant on any one source, So it is stable and adequate."
"Mr. Meeks","Everybody agrees with that?"
"Mr. Mierzwinski","I would say, Congressman, we totally agree. For example, just to be clear, OCC and OTS are virtually 100 percent funded by industry assessments, and that is part of the corruption and conflict of interest in the system, because banks can charter shop, move around. We think that this agency, because you couldn't move around, would not face that conflict of interest. But diversifying the funding, not putting all the eggs in one basket is the way to go to protect it against political or industry interference."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much. Just one correction before we break and recess for the next seven votes. Mr. Royce said that Sheila Bair was opposed to this agency. She is not opposed to this agency. She has suggested that their primary focus should be on the nonbanks that have not been regulated and it should serve as a backup to what they are doing in the other regulatory agencies. So it may not--many may not agree with that, but that is a difference between her being against the establishment of this agency and her deciding that it should do something else."
"Mr. Hensarling","Parliamentary inquiry, Madam Chairwoman. Whose time is this coming out of?"
"Ms. Waters","The Chair yields itself adequate time. Therefore, we will stand in recess until we complete the 7th vote and we will return. Thank you. "
"Mr. Watt","I do need to officially adjourn the last hearing that never got officially adjourned. There was a full committee hearing in this room, and we got called for votes, and it never came back together to officially adjourn that hearing. So let me just do that first. The full committee hearing from this morning is officially adjourned.   "
