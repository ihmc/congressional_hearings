"Speaker","Speech"
"The Chairman","The hearing will come to order. And we have 10 minutes on each side. Since there are not many members here, we can get right into the questioning and have some significant--everybody will be able to ask questions. I will say that I want to announce that on February 5th, we are going to have a joint hearing with the Committee on Small Business on the question of why more money isn't being lent. And we are picking February 5th because we agreed to have a joint hearing which means that 100 Members of the House will be the operative body. So this will be one day where, if Members come to us and say I can't make it, we will not be totally unhappy; but we did feel that this is something that the Small Business Committee has a very real interest in this as well. We have the chairman and the ranking member of the Small Business Committee on this committee so we will do that one together. And this hearing will now begin. We have 10 minutes on each side for opening statements, and I begin by recognizing for 2 minutes the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Carson."
"Mr. Carson","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As we all know, the American taxpayers are angry that their tax dollars lifted many financial firms in the time of crisis while some of these same firms now have reported record profits and are handing out lavish bonuses. Some of these firms have not turned around but continue to follow reckless compensation practices. This is because we currently have an irresponsible corporate culture where American CEOs are awarded large bonuses and generous stock options even when their companies perform poorly. There has been an increase in the typical CEO pay in the United States during the past 25 years. The total real compensation of CEOs in large publicly traded companies grew sixfold during this period. The case against the pay of American CEOs looks even more powerful by recognizing that the typical American company head receives greater total compensation than company heads in Great Britain, Canada, Japan, Spain, and in much of all developed countries. Clearly, American CEOs are being rewarded over CEOs elsewhere, even when per capita income of the countries do not differ by very much. While recent headlines on executive compensation are focused on financial firms, we cannot ignore other sectors. In fact, the corporate library recently ranked five CEOs, all outside of finance, the highest paid, worst performers. These CEOs are taking home more pay, despite the fact that their businesses have done so badly, that their stocks have tanked, and they have laid off many employees. American compensation structures are out of control and the existing compensation structure cuts to the ability of our corporate governance system to function. As we work to issue new guidelines on executive pay, we need to ensure firms begin to better align pay with stockholder value. I suggest moving beyond a nonbinding shareholder vote on executive compensation. There is continued frustration with company boards that either failed to act in response to a successful nonbinding shareholder resolution or a watered-down implementation of proposals. Boards can too easily amend or rescind board-adopted policies under the umbrella of fiduciary duty obligations. While I encourage open dialogue between shareholders, directors, and management, I do feel shareholders have the incentive to act responsibly in determining fair and equitable pay for executives of firms. Thank you, and I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Alabama--I believe the gentleman used 2\1/2\ minutes, so we will have 7\1/2\ left. The gentleman from Alabama for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, since you have been chairman, I think you have been very fair to committee Republicans. You have invited witnesses that we have requested and often invited more than just one of our choices at certain hearings. Of course, it is traditional that the Republicans get to call one witness at a hearing. I have always appreciated your consideration and I know my colleagues have too. Because you have always been accommodating of our requests, the decision to deny Republicans our witness choice for this hearing is both disappointing and puzzling. I am not sure what makes this hearing any different from any other one. So I would ask why we were denied our choice of witness. That witness was Ed DeMarco. He is the acting director of the Federal Housing Financial Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. He is the person who, along with the Treasury Department, approved a $42 million payday for 12 executives of the failed GSEs, including $6 million to the chief executives. During this hearing on compensation in the financial industry, we assumed we would be permitted to examine a real- life case of excessive unreasonable executive pay at the two companies which have received more extraordinary taxpayer assistance over--$110 billion and counting--than any others. But we were wrong. Mr. Chairman, $6 million is 15 times more than what the President earns and 30 times more than what a Cabinet Secretary earns. The Christmas Eve announcement of these bonuses was greeted by one commentator by saying the taxpayers got scrooged. Because the regulators failed to use their authority to block these colossal paydays of government employees--you have referred to them as public utilities--Congress should step in. I and several of my Republican colleagues have introduced legislation to protect taxpayers from having to foot the bill for any more multibillion-dollar tax packages. Mr. Chairman, I think the taxpayers are right. Whether it is any financial company, if the government is heavily subsidizing that company, they have a right to ask--"
"The Chairman","If you wish to continue--"
"Mr. Bachus","Another 30 seconds. They have a right to ask: Are my tax dollars subsidizing these large salaries? And they certainly have the right to hear Mr. DeMarco and find out why, on Christmas Eve, they learned that they would be paying some tremendous bonuses. The legislation also expresses a sense of Congress that each executive should return the executive pay they received in 2009 so we can reduce the Federal budget. Mr. Chairman, I do appreciate your pledge to invite Mr. DeMarco to testify at a hearing in late February, but I am disappointed that the American taxpayers will have to wait another 5 weeks for an explanation from the Obama Administration about this Christmas Eve raid on the Treasury to pay these executives. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman consumed 3 minutes. There will be 7 minutes on his side and 7\1/2\ on this side. I recognize the gentleman from California."
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you."
"The Chairman","For 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Sherman","Yes. I believe in capitalism, that means shareholder control, shareholder risk. That is why we should have a say on pay and it ought to be binding. After 13 years in Congress, I am not a real fan of nonbinding resolutions. There is a special circumstance where a company is too-big-to-fail because at that point, they have a quasi-Federal Government guarantee. The best solution is to break them up so that we don't have anyone who is too-big-to-fail. I commend the gentleman from Pennsylvania whose amendment would at least allow the Administration to do just that. Until then, those that are too-big-to-fail should face fees to recoup for the taxpayer the benefits that the organizations get from their implicit Federal guarantee. The bill we passed in this committee, in this House, does that, and, with Peter's amendment, allows those firms to pay for the past cost of the too-big-to-fail as well as provide it a before-the-fact fund to pay for the too-big-to-fail problems of the future. It also makes sense as long as there are those that are too-big-to-fail and enjoy the implicit Federal guarantee, if they are quasi-government entities or quasi- federally guaranteed, they should play by government salary rules, which are a lot different from those that Wall Street is familiar with. The best solution is for these firms to voluntarily divide themselves so they are not too-big-to-fail. And we can go back to real capitalism--shareholder control, shareholder risk--and a Congress and a Federal Government that doesn't have to concern itself with salaries and other aspects of internal corporate decisionmaking I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman has consumed, I believe, 1 minute and 20 seconds. So that will leave us on this side about 6\1/2\ minutes. And the gentleman from Texas is recognized for 2\1/4\ minutes."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me see if I can get this straight. We are going to regulate the compensation for companies that paid the TARP money back, but we approved a multimillion-dollar pay package for Freddie and Fannie who will never pay any of that money back. Now, that is what I call picking winners and losers. And in this case, unfortunately, the losers win. Since the American people now own almost 80 percent of Fannie Mae, we need good management to stop the bleeding and see if we can recoup at least some of the taxpayers' money. But more importantly, we need consistent policy in this country. I think it is important to kind of reflect on what is going on today. We are going to regulate compensation, tell companies what they can and cannot do, break them up if some bureaucrat thinks they are too big, tax their products. By the way, I am not taking about Venezuela, I am talking about what is going on in the United States. The American people are getting tired of the government telling them what to do. So today, we are going to talk about more big-government intervention into America's companies. We are going to try to look tough on the financial institutions so we can appease the anger of the American people for committing trillions of their hard-earned money to bail these entities out in the first place. If any colleagues were so concerned about the taxpayers and not Wall Street, why did they bail out Wall Street at the expense of the American taxpayers? What the American people really want us to focus on is how can we raise their wages and create jobs for those who have lost theirs, instead of focusing on issues that don't create jobs and, in fact, are going to cause the American people to lose their jobs. Mr. President, we need you to focus on jobs, not raising taxes, growing government, and spending money we don't have on flawed stimulus packages. Where are the jobs you promised the American people? Instead of more government, the American people want more jobs. They sent you a wake-up call on Tuesday in Massachusetts, Mr. President. I hope you were listening. With that, I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Kansas is recognized for 2 minutes. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just like reasonable executive compensation rules to increase financial stability should not be bipartisan, reforming Fannie and Freddie should not be either. I am disappointed that some of my friends on the other side forget that when they controlled Congress for 12 years, they did not enact meaningful reform of Fannie and Freddie. Last year, the former chair of this committee, Mike Oxley, said, ``We missed a golden opportunity that would have avoided a lot of problems we are facing now if we hadn't had such a firm ideological position at the White House and the Treasury and the Fed.'' I hope we can come together this time, Republicans and Democrats, to explore good policy options to deal with Fannie and Freddie later this year. Turning back to executive compensation, I have always felt that financial firms receiving taxpayer assistance should receive the most scrutiny with respect to their executive compensation practices. One example involves reports of large salaries for Fannie and Freddie executives. I wrote them about this last March when we first learned about it, and after receiving an unsatisfactory response from FHFA, I joined Chairman Frank and others to vote for H.R. 1664 to stop those unfair pay practices of TARP recipients. Protecting taxpayers should not be a partisan issue. So I was disappointed that some of my friends on the other side didn't join us to support that commonsense measure. Finally, for firms who have repaid TARP, I don't think the government should go in and set specific pay levels, but to better protect investors and taxpayers in the future, the government does have a role in looking at how pay is structured more broadly to ensure risk-taking is properly aligned with rewards and doesn't pose a systemic risk. I look forward to hearing from our witnesses and exploring issues in further detail, d I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. After upset defeats in the States of New Jersey and Virginia, and a stunning upset defeat in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, I would have hoped that this Administration and this Congress would have gotten down to job number one, and that is to help create jobs for the American people. Instead, it really appears that the Administration is set upon an adventure in scapegoatism: Let's see if we can find an entity that perhaps is more unpopular than our Administration in the United States Congress. Thus we have this launching of the assault upon the investment community. Now, are there outrageous compensation systems out there? Yes. I am outraged by late-night comedians who make tens of millions of dollars to be mean to each other. I am outraged by professional athletes who make tens of millions of dollars and abuse their spouses and girlfriends. And, yes, I am outraged by compensation packages on Wall Street as well. But none, none, are more outrageous than those who use taxpayer funds to reward the execs at Fannie and Freddie. And so on Christmas Eve, this Administration decided to take out all the goodies from the stockings of the American taxpayer and hand it over to the executives of Fannie and Freddie, which are functionally owned by the United States Government, and hand them out, the two CEOs, $6 million pay packages, $42 million for the rest of their execs. And so we are paying these people bonuses to lose tens of billions of dollars for the United States taxpayer. Now, what people do with their money is their business; what they do with the taxpayer money is our business. And so I echo the comments of our ranking member. I have said privately and publicly that this is a committee that has a reputation for fairness under Chairman Frank. Now, I am unaware under his leadership, or his Republican predecessor in the 7 years that I have been here, that the Minority has ever been denied their request to have a witness. So we requested a witness, Ed DeMarco, the acting head of FHFA to ask a simple question--"
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. If you want to take more time, it will come out of the 10 minutes."
"Mr. Hensarling","I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","Well, unanimous consent for an additional 15 seconds to finish that thought, that wouldn't come out of everybody's time, if the gentleman would like."
"Mr. Hensarling","I was hoping that Mr. DeMarco could be here to answer the question why he has spent millions for bonuses to pay people to lose billions of dollars for the taxpayer, and unfortunately again for whatever reason, that request was denied. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","I yield myself my remaining time which I think is 3\1/2\ minutes; is that correct? I want to thank both the gentlemen from Texas and the gentleman from Alabama for their comments about the fairness of the committee. I am very proud that I think this committee holds the record for the number of amendments that we are debating on the Floor at markup time. We do have one difference here. The members of the Republican side have made the distinction between private sector and public sector entities when it comes to compensation. That is why I wanted to defer Mr. DeMarco to a hearing we will have with Mr. DeMarco, and I hope Mr. Lockhart--a Bush appointee who had that position before and it was was a holdover--and Mr. Feinberg, and probably Sheila Bair and Dan Tarullo. That is, I think it makes sense to separate the issues of what we do about private sector compensation where our role is a more limited one, as we all agree, and public sector compensation. The question for Mr. DeMarco is what do we do about public sector compensation? Now, I also want to say I am not usually the one who welcomes converts. That has generally not been my side of the street. But I do want to welcome my Republican colleagues to conversion to the notion that we should regulate the pay of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Last year, this committee twice reported bills to the Floor which explicitly proposed restrictions on the pay of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and the Republicans opposed it in committee and opposed it on the Floor. Indeed, in the case of one of the bills that wasn't on the private sector, because it wasn't clear what the status was at the time. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, offered an amendment to make sure that they were explicitly covered. We adopted the amendment. But that did not persuade the gentleman from Texas to vote for the bill on the Floor. So we have had two bills which passed the House which explicitly authorized regulation in the pay of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and all the Republicans on this dais here voted against it both times. One Republican, Mr. Jones, voted for it one time. So I am a little skeptical as to why we have all of this coming up now. By the way, when we passed the bill that specifically would have done it for public-funded companies, we got a letter on March 20th--which I will put into the record--from James Lockhart, the Bush appointee who was running the Housing Finance Agency, held over, strenuously objecting to it. So it was the Bush Administration that first raised the objections of the Bush Administration holdover. I think the pay that was given to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac was too high, and I think this: We will have a hearing with Mr. DeMarco, and others who administer pay schemes for public employees in a month. My colleague from Texas said he wanted to know the answer. I know he is a man of great patience and he has a very strong attention span. I don't think a month from now he will have forgotten the questions he wanted to ask. He could write them down and we will preserve them. But, yes, we will have this. I also believe what we have here is an embarrassment on the part of my Republican colleagues because they don't want to do anything about the excessive pay in the private sector, nor do they want to appear to not be doing anything about it, so they are changing the subject. By the way, we do not propose any specific limits on the pay in the private sector. We do say that the shareholders should vote--radical motion--but we also say that there is a public spillover effect; namely, that the structure of those compensation packages often incentivize excessively risky behavior. And we have mandated that the regulators end this ``heads they win,'' ``tails they break even at worst.'' So that is what we are talking about, private and public sector. We are dealing with the private sector today, to the discomfort of my Republican colleagues. We will get to the public sector in a month. The gentleman from--the gentleman's side has 2\1/2\ minutes left. Does the gentleman wish to use it?"
"Mr. Bachus","I would ask--"
"The Chairman","We have 10 minutes for debate."
"Mr. Bachus","I would like to claim 15 seconds."
"The Chairman","The gentleman is recognized for 15 seconds."
"Mr. Bachus","The executive compensation the chairman refers to covered all companies, both private and public. It covered community banks and it covered all employees, not just top executives. It was a political response to AIG, but it was poorly written--"
"The Chairman","Does the gentleman yield?"
"Mr. Bachus","The Senate has never taken up that bill, and the last time I looked, the Democrats controlled the Senate. They realized it was a bad bill. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","Does the gentleman yield?"
"Mr. Bachus","No, my time has expired."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New Jersey is now recognized for 2 minutes and 15 seconds."
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the chairman, and I thank the ranking member. And as the ranking member has already outlined, and I concur with his position with regard to the appropriate request for someone else at this hearing, the acting head of FHFA, and I appreciate the chairman's explanation of why he thought we should segregate the panels in this manner. But that really doesn't go to the comment that I think the gentleman from Texas made that no one up here can remember the last time that a member of the Minority requested someone to come to the panel, be a witness, and a Majority party refused that appropriate request. As of this point, the chairman has yet to fully explain why they refused that request. As the gentleman from Texas also points out, Fannie and Freddie are different from these; they are under government control. The chairman of this committee, as a matter of fact, has recently stated they are basically, ``public policy instruments of the government.'' Fannie and Freddie are. So while I may think the Majority's initiatives in the area of executive compensation in that April legislation are examples of government overreach into the private sector, if there is one example, one case, one line of executive compensation that should be looked at, it is where taxpayer dollars are being used, and that is in the area of Fannie and Freddie. And beyond this point, the area of executive compensation, there is a bigger issue that really we should be looking at. That is the Christmas Eve announcement, when the Administration took action, without any congressional input whatsoever, of the unilateral lift of the $400 cap on Fannie and Freddie's bailout and authorized unlimited taxpayer funds to use, both firms, over the next 3 years. Again, we have requested a hearing on this, or the chairman to allow a witness on this, and again he has refused. Meanwhile, however, the Republican Party has come back with our proposals, but they have been ignored. The Republicans in this committee have put forth proposals to reform these institutions, because it is indisputable that Fannie and Freddie were the central role in the mortgage meltdown that we have experienced. They helped ignite the economic crisis that has left millions of Americans unemployed. So passing stronger GSE reform legislation should be at the very top of this committee's agenda. Thank you."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. We will now proceed to hear from the witnesses, repeat witnesses in every case, who are always welcome in this committee because they are people who make very significant contributions not just in this testimony but even more importantly, obviously, in the debate over important public issues in the country and the world. We begin with Professor Lucian Bebchuk, who is a professor of law, economics and finance, and director of the corporate governance program at Harvard Law School. "
"STATEMENT OF LUCIAN A. BEBCHUK, WILLIAM J. FRIEDMAN AND ALICIA TOWNSEND FRIEDMAN PROFESSOR OF LAW, ECONOMICS, AND FINANCE, AND DIRECTOR OF THE CORPORATE GOVERNANCE PROGRAM, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL"," "
"Mr. Bebchuk","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and distinguished members of the committee, thank you very much for inviting me to testify here today. I would like to devote my introductory comments to making four points. First, there is a growing acceptance, including among business leaders, that compensation structures have provided perverse incentives. They have encouraged financial executives to seek to improve short-term results even at the expense of an elevated risk of an implosion later on. Let me illustrate this problem with the example of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers, the two investment banks that melted down in 2008. Many commentators have assumed that the executives of these firms sold their own compensation, their own wealth wiped out together with the firms', and then inferred from this assumed fact that the firms' risk-taking could not have been motivated by perverse incentives created by pay arrangements. In a recent paper, my coauthors and I did a case study of compensation at those two firms between 2000 and 2008, and we find that this assumed effect is incorrect. We estimate that the top five executive teams of Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers derived cash flows of about $1.4 billion and $1 billion, respectively, from cash bonuses and equity sales during 2000 to 2008, and these cash flows substantially exceeded the value of the executives' initial holdings in the beginning of the period. As a result, unlike what happened with the long-term shareholders, the executive net payouts for 2000 to 2008 were decidedly positive. The second point I would like to make is that we cannot rely solely on existing governance arrangements to produce the necessary reforms. To be sure, some firms have announced reforms of the compensation structures. For example, they indicated that bonuses would be subject to clawbacks. But firms have generally not provided information that would enable outsiders to determine whether the clawbacks would be meaningful and affect behavior or would be merely cosmetic. This is an area where the devil is in the details. Because the changes that firms adopt appear to be at least partly motivated by desire to appear responsive to outside criticism, there is a basis for concern that arrangements with details that are not disclosed might not be sufficiently effective. What else should be done? The point I would like to stress is to improve arrangements, pay arrangements in particular, in governance more generally. We have to strengthen shareholder rights. In addition to introducing say on pay votes, which H.R. 3269 would do, there are other things that need to be done to bring shareholder rights to the same level as the shareholders in the U.K. and other English-speaking countries enjoy. In particular, the following aspects of their existing state first deserves the Commission's attention. Many publicly traded firms still do not have majority voting. Shareholders still like the power to place director candidates under corporate bylaws. Many privately traded funds still have staggered boards, and many such firms have supermajority requirements that make it difficult for shareholders to change governance arrangements. Finally, in addition to strengthening shareholder rights, it remains important to have regulatory supervision of pay structures in financial firms, as the provisions of H.R. 3269 would require. Opponents of regulatory intervention argue that such regulatory supervision would drive a talent away. However, the regulation under consideration focuses on structure, not on pay levels, and firms would still be able to offer packages that are sufficiently attractive in terms of pay levels. One of the established insights in economics is that it is never efficient to compensate agents using perverse incentives; in the financial sector, an especially important context to apply this established insight. Thank you. "
"The Chairman","Next, we have Professor Joseph Stiglitz, university professor at the Columbia Business School. "
"STATEMENT OF JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ, UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR, COLUMBIA BUSINESS SCHOOL"," "
"Mr. Stiglitz","It is both a source of pleasure and sadness to testify before you today. I welcome this opportunity to testify on this important subject, but I am sorry that things have turned out so badly thus far. In this brief testimony I can only touch on a few key points, and many of these points I elaborate in my book, ``FreeFall,'' which was published just a few days ago. Our financial system failed to perform the key roles that it is supposed to perform in our society: managing risk; and allocating capital. A good financial system performs these functions at low transaction costs. Our financial system created risk and mismanaged capital, all the while generating huge transaction costs, as the sector garnered some 40 percent of all corporate profits in the years before the crisis. So deceptive were the systems of creative accounting the banks employed that, as the crisis evolved, they didn't even know their own balance sheet, so they knew that they couldn't know that of any other bank. We may congratulate ourselves that we have managed to pull back from the brink, but we should not forget that it was the financial sector that brought us to the brink of disaster. While the failures of the financial system that led the economy to the brink of ruin are by now obvious, the failings of our financial system were more pervasive. Small- and medium- sized enterprises found it difficult to get credit, even as the financial system was pushing credit on poor people beyond their ability to repay. Modern technology allows for the creation of an efficient low-cost electronic payment mechanism, but businesses pay 1 to 2 percent or more for fees for a transaction that should cost pennies or less. Our financial system not only mismanaged risk and created products that increased the risk faced by others, but they also failed to create financial products that could help ordinary Americans face the important risk they confronted, such as the risk of homeownership or the risk of inflation. Indeed, I am in total agreement with Paul Volcker. It is hard to find evidence of any real growth associated with many of the so-called innovations in our financial system, though it is easy to see the link between those innovations and the disaster that confronted our economy. Underlying all the failures a simple point seems to have been forgotten: Financial markets are a means to an end, not an end in themselves. We should remember, too, that this is not the first time our banks have been bailed out, saved from bearing the full consequences of their bad lending. Market economies work to produce growth and efficiency, but only when private rewards and social returns are aligned. Unfortunately, in the financial sector, both individual and institutional incentives were misaligned, which is why this discussion of incentives is so important. The consequences of the failures of the financial system are not borne by just those in the sector, but also by homeowners, retirees, workers, and taxpayers, and not just in this country but also around the world. The externalities, as economists refer to these impacts and others, are massive; and they are the reason why it is perfectly appropriate that Congress should be concerned. The presence of externalities is one of the reasons why the sector needs to be regulated. In previous testimony I have explained what kinds of regulations are required to reduce the risk of adverse externalities. I have also explained the danger of excessive risk-taking and how that can be curtailed. I have explained the dangers posed by underregulated derivative markets. I regret to say that so far, more than a year after the crisis peaked, too little has been done on either account. But too-big-to-fail banks create perverse incentives which also have a lot to do with what happened. I want to focus my remaining time on the issue of incentives and executive compensation. As I said, there are also key issues of organizational incentives, especially those that arise from institutions that are too-big-to-fail, too-big- to-be-resolved, or too-intertwined-to-fail. The one thing that economists agree upon is that incentives matter. Even a casual look at the conventional incentive structures, with payments focused on short-run performance and managers not bearing the full downside consequences of their mistakes, suggested that they would lead to shortsighted behavior and excessive risk-taking. And so they did. Let me try to summarize some of the general remarks that I make in my written testimony that I hope will be entered into the record. Flawed incentives played an important role, as I said before, in this and other failures of the financial system to perform its central roles. Not only do they encourage excessive risk-taking and shortsighted behavior, but they also encourage predatory behavior. Poorly designed incentive systems can lead to a deterioration of product quality, and this happened in the financial sector. This is not surprising, given the ample opportunities provided by creative accounting. Moreover, many of the compensation schemes actually provide incentives for deceptive accounting. Markets only allocate resources well when information is good. But the incentive structures encouraged the provision of distorted and misleading information. The design of the incentives system demonstrates a failure to understand risk and incentives and/or a deliberate attempt to deceive investors, exploiting deficiencies in our systems of corporate governance. I want to agree very much with Professor Bebchuk's view of the need for reforms in corporate governance. There are alternative compensation schemes that would provide better incentives, but few firms choose to implement such schemes. It is also the case that these perverse incentives failed to address adequately providing incentives for innovations that would have allowed for a better functioning of our economic system. "
"The Chairman","Nell Minow, who is the founder and editor of The Corporate Library. "
"STATEMENT OF NELL MINOW, EDITOR, THE CORPORATE LIBRARY"," "
"Ms. Minow","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. It is a real honor to be back here again, and, like Professor Stiglitz said, I wish I had better news for you. In previous appearances, I have called executive compensation both the symptom and the cause of the instability of the financial services sector and our capital markets. I regret to say that the problem continues. Yesterday, the Supreme Court told us that a corporation is a person with First Amendment rights, but as Baron Lord Thurlow told us hundreds of years ago, a corporation has no soul to be damned, no body to be kicked, and that is why corporations essentially get away with murder in matters like compensation. The boards of Wall Street financial institutions implemented pay plans that were a major and direct cause of the financial meltdown. These purported bastions of capitalism protected themselves from risk by limiting their downside exposure and taking their pay off the top. Second, rinse repeat. They took bailout money and kept paying themselves as though they earned it. What they did before the bailout was counterproductive and misguided. What they have done since the bailout is an outrage, or, as my grandmother would have said, a ``shanda.'' Since the only portion of pay that TARP did not restrict was base pay, everybody got a raise. For example, Wells Fargo's board approved a 522 percent salary increase for the CEO from $900,000 to $5,600,000. The extra was paid in stock, and we have seen this throughout the center. They took the opportunity, when the stock market was at its rock bottom, to load everybody up with buckets of new stock and options. So I am predicting now that the next time you have me back here to speak, we will be talking about how outrageous it is that they got insane pay packages again; but now is when they are happening. And we will see the payout later on. These enormous grants of stock issued at historic low prices are resulting in enormous payouts based on the infusion from the bailouts in the overall market. I completely agree with what the members of this committee have said about taxpayer money. This is taxpayer money. They are getting paid as though they earned that money, the money that the taxpayers put into it. They are taking a piece off of the top of the taxpayers' money. That is absolutely right. That is an outrage. So the clawbacks that were required as a result of this committee's work are also being subverted. As Professor Bebchuk said, there is a lot of weasel language being instituted into the clawbacks, saying that bad faith has to be required, or some kind of emotion or feeling or intention has to be required. Clawbacks should apply no matter what the reason for the correction; otherwise, as Professor Siglitz said, they create a perverse incentive. I ask this committee to lead the way to put an end to too- big-to-fail, the term and the concept. If a company is too-big- to-fail, it is too-big-to-succeed, or, as the title of a thoughtful new book by Robert Pozen puts it, it is ``too-big- to-save.'' If an enterprise is too-big-to-fail, it is a utility and it should be regulated like one and executives should be paid like public servants. Wall Street boards and executives have abused shareholders by creating perverse incentives for themselves, through their pay plans. The IMF has a very important new study linking lobbying expenditures and high-risk lending. In other words, it is another example of externalizing the risks onto everybody else and keeping the pay plans. They are now doing their best to perpetuate this system by pouring over $70 million so far into fighting any meaningful reform. This is just another example of diversion of assets to perpetuate the externalization of risk onto the shareholders and the taxpayers. I hope that Congress will address this attempt to subvert the efficient oversight of the market and restore the crediblity of our financial sector by removing obstacles to effective shareholder oversight of pay. "
"The Chairman","Thank you. Let me begin the question and--I want to give my Republican colleagues credit. They fundamentally want to take the attention away from the subject of excessive compensation, which is a legitimate public sector issue, probably because, as Ms. Minow just noted, they are paying money which they are able to have in part because of a significant public intervention; also because there are effects on the economy as a whole as to the way in which it is structured. And also, of course, because the notion that we are interfering in a private sector sphere when we set the laws for corporate governance is nonsense. Corporations are a creation of the law, even though the Supreme Court thinks God made them, and this can be regulated by us in many ways. They simply don't want to do anything that would interfere with that, but they have raised the Fannie/ Freddie thing. I want to respond to one point that the gentleman from Alabama raised when I pointed out that the Republicans twice voted in committee and on the Floor against legislation to give regulators the power over Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac salaries, which they now say they want. He said, well, that was in the bill that covered all the private sector. But there were two bills. The gentleman from Alabama forgot to mention one. The first bill that came forward was H.R. 1664, which specifically covered only those financial institutions that were receiving financial assistance--TARP money and Fannie and Freddie. It had nothing to do with the rest of the private sector. Page 2 of that bill: No financial institution has received or receives a direct capital investment under the TARP program or with respect to the Federal National Mortgage Association, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation or Federal Home Loan Bank, etc. So we had a bill that dealt only with TARP recipients, Fannie and Freddie, and put tough restrictions on them to be administered and they voted against it. So it is not my fault that there wasn't the power to do that more. Yes, I think they got too much money over the Christmas Eve period. I believe, though, that the remedy here is to in fact-- as I believe this committee will be recommending--abolish Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in their current form and come up with a whole new system of housing finance. That is the approach, rather than the piecemeal one. But the fact is, there were two bills, and Republicans voted against both of them. One covered all private sector and public sector, but one bill they voted against specifically was limited to TARP recipients in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and it passed the House and it failed. The gentleman is right; the Senate didn't take it up. If they want to blame the Senate, that is okay, I guess, for them to say it, but I don't know why the fact that the Senate might not be taking something up is a justification for a Member of the House to vote ``no.'' So it is very clear, we put forward a bill that would have toughened restrictions on compensation at the TARP recipients and at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in April. They voted against it. Now, to divert attention from this subject which makes them uncomfortable because they don't want to do anything about it, they bring it up. Let me ask one question to Professor Stiglitz and the others. One of the arguments we have gotten against the President's proposal to tax large financial institutions to recoup the money that was paid out through the TARP and elsewhere that was of great assistance to the financial sector, this will diminish the amount of money they have available for loans and it will force them, over their great reluctance no doubt, to raise credit card and other fees. Does the size of the bonus pool and the amount of compensation have any relevance to that argument? Professor Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","Yes, obviously funds are fungible, and money going out to bonuses reduces the capital base of the banks, and to an extent the money that has been paid out in bonuses, whatever the form, reduces their ability to lend. That is obviously a much more significant amount. Let me just emphasize one point, since we are talking about incentives. The intent of the President's proposal here is changing the current incentives of the banks to have excessive risk-taking, and excessive risk-taking led to the economy being brought to the brink."
"The Chairman","Tax structure--"
"Mr. Stiglitz","That is right, these incentives partly arose from the fact that the tax structure was based on the amount of liabilities that they had. It was directed at--"
"The Chairman","Tier 1 capital money."
"Mr. Stiglitz","Exactly."
"The Chairman","What is the relationship between the board of directors and the CEO currently?"
"Ms. Minow","I know it is difficult for people who know what real elections are to understand that, but we use the term ``election'' when we talk about boards of directors, even though essentially the CEO controls who is on the board. These arrangements are often very cozy. It was not that long ago that CEOs of Cummins Engine and Inland Steel served as chairs of each others' compensation committees. At another company, the CEO is the chairman of the local university's board of directors. The provost is on his compensation committee, etc. So therefore it is a very close circle. And until shareholders can replace directors who get it wrong, we are not going to see any change. So many of the directors, almost all of the directors of the bailout companies continue to serve."
"The Chairman","Thank you. The gentleman from Alabama."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Ms. Minow, you have heard the chairman talking about his executive compensation bill that was introduced last year that the Republicans voted against along with many Democrats. You published an article on The Corporate Library Web site entitled, ``Right Question, Wrong Answer'' that was critical of the executive compensation legislation, and that was the legislation that Chairman Frank incorporated into the bill. He talks about criticizing us for not voting for it. In the article you say, ``I have the utmost respect for politicians and bureaucrats but I also recognize their limits. The government should not micromanage pay.'' I happen to agree with that position. Could you elaborate to committee members on your specific concerns about entrusting political figures and government bureaucrats with the responsibility for designing incentive-based compensation structure?"
"Ms. Minow","Certainly, as I said repeatedly before this committee, I do not believe that the government should set pay. I do believe in removing obstacles to allowing shareholders to provide that kind of feedback, as I just said to the chairman, by removing directors who do a bad job through say on pay. I think the bill was perhaps necessary but not sufficient, and I do share the concern of the members of the committee that some of the terminology in the bill was not--did not give enough guidance."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, I appreciate that. Obviously, the bill gave the Treasury Secretary really carte blanche authority to define unreasonable excessive compensation, and it wasn't just for top executives, it was for all employees. And I would vote against that bill today if it were up before me. Professor--is it ``Bibcock?''"
"Mr. Bebchuk","``Bebchuk.''"
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. In the past, you have criticized GSE executive compensation packages as being decoupled from performance. Under the terms of the GSE executive compensation package that was announced Christmas Eve, two-thirds, or $4 million of the $6 million cash compensation for each of the two CEOs, is completely unrelated to firm performance or any performance manager. Would you agree that the latest GSE executive compensation awards still failed to adequately link pay and performance?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","The study you mention was one that was probably several years ago, and it was a careful analysis of compensation arrangements at the time, mainly with respect to the chairman at the time, Raines. And those were the conclusions then. I have not studied the most recent decisions and therefore I am not in a position to evaluate them."
"Mr. Bachus","If I say $4 million of that was not linked to performance and does not link pay and performance, you would still think that--you would still have your same objections to those compensation packages?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I don't think I can really offer a view about a package that I haven't really studied."
"Mr. Bachus","All right. Ms. Minow, in your written testimony you decry compensation arrangements that widen the gulf between pay and performance and between integrity and outrageousness. In your view, do the pay packages of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac executives, most particularly the $6 million awarded to each of the CEOs, adequately link pay and performance?"
"Ms. Minow","I have been a consistent critic of the pay packages at Fannie and Freddie, going back before the financial meltdown. And, again, they have a corporate governance nightmare. You can't be both a public and a private enterprise at the same time."
"Mr. Bachus","Do they meet your definition of outrageous?"
"Ms. Minow","They are not as outrageous as the previous pay plans at Fannie and Freddie, but I think they are wrong."
"Mr. Bachus","They are wrong, but how about outrageous? Do they meet your definition of outrageous?"
"Ms. Minow","No, no. If I am calibrating the word ``outrageous,'' they are nowhere near the category of outrageous--"
"Mr. Bachus","It might be like a class 4 instead of a class 5 outrageous?"
"Ms. Minow","They are troubling; how is that? They are troubling but not outrageous."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. I appreciate that very much. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I want to take 15 seconds, if he will yield to me. My friend from Alabama continues to ignore the fact that there were two bills, one on executive compensation involving the private sector, another that only dealt with TARP and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and he voted against it. So what he talked about before, what he quoted Ms. Minow about, was the one about general compensation. But there was a separate bill for Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the TARP that came after this question, and that is the one he voted against. There is one bill. It is not my time. The gentleman from Pennsylvania."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will just open up first with some remarks to the panel, and I appreciate your opinions when I get to conclude. Very often, I have had the occasion over the last 6 to 9 months to make a speech in my district because I am trying to reach constituents to understand the overall complex problem of salaries and wages. Now, as a given factor in my congressional district in Pennsylvania, the average wage is about $13 an hour. And if you multiply that times 2,000 working hours a year, that comes to an annual income of, on average, $26,000. In the last 9 months or a year, I have had several witnesses who have appeared before my subcommittee, and we have gotten to this question of salary and compensation, and what we do about it. I, for one, am not certain that we put enough direct attention to the matter, and could get into difficulty if we start deciding that we are the final arbiter of what a fair salary is, because quite frankly, I will confess, I don't know. If hiring a brain surgeon, I guess, and I need brain surgery, there is no amount too excessive until after the success of the operation. Then I will be annoyed, whatever the bill. The reality is--that is not the topic of our discussion today--but in the hedge fund industry, they report--I remember one witness who was a little annoyed involving a cross examination: What did he make and what is his relationship? He earned about $2.5 billion a year, and I pressed him because I was offended that he only paid a tax rate of 15 percent because of the structure of his salary, putting him in capital gains as opposed to regular tax. After 15 or 20 minutes, with great annoyance, he finally put his hand in his pocket, leaned back and said, ``Congressman why are you picking on me? What did I do to you?'' I said, ``You did nothing; you happen to be a witness and I am trying to extract some information.'' He said, ``Well, I want you to know I am only the 51st highest-income person in this country.'' This astounded me. I thought we had located the highest-income person. I found out he actually was not and is not, and there are some who make a great deal more. I guess the first question that I would ask is, what is too much? What is too high? Is it $5 billion, or $50 billion? And now I pose that question, because we always use numbers, and I go back to my congressional district of $13 an hour wage. The gentleman who was testifying before me, his hourly wage is $1,300,000. That is what he makes every hour of the year. Now, when you do the mathematics of that, he makes 100,000 times the average wage of an average worker in my district. How do we get a sense? Regardless of what compensation we pass here or do on Fannie Mae, they are chickens; what do they get paid, $6 million a year? That is peanuts. I am wondering if we are approaching this from perhaps the incorrect direction. Should we be looking at, first of all, what do we need to get to a balanced budget? Because these people aren't just earning and taking corporate money or profits. These people are not picking up their burden in society in proportion to their income. And as a result now this year, we are ending up with a shortfall that we could make up if we didn't have these extraordinary ways of avoiding income. I am just wondering, should we approach this from changing the tax structure and perhaps get to a level field that way, as opposed to identifying particular people where we may be able to exercise power and those so that we cannot. And I am just curious. Let me throw that out there very quickly."
"The Chairman","Maybe 30 seconds for an answer."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I agree with you that the basic framework for thinking about equity should be through our tax system. Incentives are related, because the question is, would they work a little bit less hard if they paid higher taxes? I think the answer is clearly no, it would not have a significantly adverse affect. The issue that I talked about in my testimony is that the structure of the pay of the executives in these banks has strong effects. The reason we are interested in them is because those effects affected the taxpayers because it led to the economy falling apart. These pay structures imposed huge costs on the rest of us, and therefore they are a legitimate source of concern, as opposed to lots of other areas where people get high pay but are not as much a legitimate source of concern. The way we deal with that is through the tax system."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we have heard from the panel on where they think that there have been abuses in the pay structure, the corporate pay structure. I think one of the things that I would like to hear from the panel is who is doing it right? Where is the model that other companies should follow? Mr. Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Yes. I think that there is evidence that firms with shareholder rights are stronger, where you have less arrangement that would make it difficult to pay directors. Compensation in those firms is more sensitive to performance and also CEO turnover is more sensitive to performance. So we have evidence that relates, empirical evidence that relates the level of shareholder rights, both with firm value in general but also with the quality-of-pay structures."
"Ms. Minow","If you would like to have a specific example, I can tell you that Home Depot went from the very bottom of the list to near the top of the list by going from a CEO where 90 percent of his pay was not related to performance to a CEO where 90 percent of his pay is related to performance."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I want to make one remark because we keep talking about pay related to performance. It is very difficult to identify what you mean by performance. When a company does well as measured by the stock going up, but the reason the stock is going up is because the stock market is going up, then it wasn't what an employee did that led to the company's stock going up. One of the points I make in my written testimony was that, in fact, if you look at the design of many of the so- called ``pay for performance,'' they are not pay for performance. They merely have that in their name."
"Ms. Minow","I cover that in my written testimony as well."
"Mr. Neugebauer","One of the things that concerns me is when you start down the road of government designing these compensation plans--and now really what we are doing is we are saying, there are a few companies out there, and I think everybody is trying to point to the financial institution--but the question is, what about all the other companies that are actually doing it right? How do we justify whether we are going to pick the ones we don't think are doing it right and we are going to let the others fall?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Nobody is talking about the government really prescribing what the pay arrangements would be but, rather, giving shareholder rights and improving corporate governance arrangements. And if that happens, then the firms that are doing it right will continue to do it right, but those firms that didn't do it right because those were not sufficiently focused on shorter interest would hopefully improve their pay arrangements."
"Mr. Neugebauer","But the shareholder has the ultimate right, don't they? That is whether to own a share of stock or not. And if I I think that company CEO is making too much money and the boys are dividing the pie and the shareholders aren't getting much return, I just sell my share of stock and I move on."
"Mr. Bebchuk","Your ability to sell the share provides you with no protection. It providers insiders with no incentives to behave well. Why? Because let's suppose the price right now is $100, and you believe that if managed well, the company would be worth $120. If you sell, you would be getting--you would be passing this imperfectly managed share to somebody else who would pay $100. But your concern is that you should be getting to $120, and the ability to sell the share on the market for $100 in no way provides you access nor makes it likely that you will be able to capture the $120."
"Ms. Minow","I just want to say that is also kind of an outdated approach since up to 70 percent of the stock in most major companies are held by institutional investors that don't have the luxury of selling out every time; because of transaction costs and other issues, they are pretty much stuck. And so the question is, is it more beneficial for them economically to pursue better pay than to just abandon it and leave and invest in some other company that overpays their executives?"
"Mr. Neugebauer","I don't think I can agree that people are stuck in any position. If you own a share of publicly traded company stock, you can send a message to the management. In fact, some of those larger investors can actually send a very strong message. If a large investor in a company moves a very large block of stock, sells that stock, that sends a signal to the rest of the market: Why did he or she do that? So to say I think people are stuck in a position is a little--"
"Ms. Minow","The data actually goes the other way on that. And as far as large investors making a difference, you are right; they can call up the board of directors and ask for better. All we are asking is to make it more possible."
"Mr. Stiglitz","Can I make a general point, which is that corporations are a creation of the State. We write the laws that define a corporation. What I think Mr. Bebchuk and Ms. Minow have been emphasizing is that we want to think about how we write those laws to make sure that our whole corporate sector works more efficiently, which has to do with the systems of corporate governance. But what are those systems? I think that is really the debate here. There is going to be one system or another, so the question is, can we create a system that is better than the current system?"
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California."
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you. Responding to the gentleman who was just speaking, I would say selling the stock is an imperfect way for shareholders to control things. First, they pay a big capital gains tax when they sell. Then they have transaction costs. As the witness pointed out, they get a low price for the stock because whomever buys it is buying into a company with miscompensated executives. And then finally, they have the opportunity to invest the proceeds into another company which has bad corporate governance and overpaid executives. I would like to start with an observation. It is obvious that the establishment in this country is under attack by populism in a way that has not occurred in most of our lifetimes. The results in Massachusetts were not the victory I think mostly for any one political party, but a victory for populism against the establishment. And it is not a coincidence the Supreme Court decided yesterday to overrule 100 years of precedents, something they would ordinarily find very painful, in order to arm the death star so that the empire could strike back; and whatever we do, whatever we say here today, could easily be drowned out by unlimited corporate publicity and propaganda. I want to pick up on the comments of the gentleman from Pennsylvania. I think this committee has done a good job on executive compensation when compared to the Ways and Means Committee which has continued to allow hedge fund managers to pay taxes at only 15 percent unless--I yield to the gentleman."
"The Chairman","If the gentleman would yield. The House in fact voted for the bill the gentleman is talking about. It is in the Senate. In fairness to our colleagues, they did bring up the right bill from our standpoint, which we voted for and sent over there."
"Mr. Sherman","It is always the Senate. In any case, the tax laws of this country not only allow a 15 percent tax on hedge fund managers, but a zero percent tax if they incorporate their hedge fund in the Caribbean. And you compare that to the probably 28 percent rate paid by the gentleman's constituents in Pennsylvania, and you see that we don't exactly have a fair tax system. I don't think that the gentleman who makes $1 million an hour is going to work less hard if his after-tax compensation is reduced to a paltry $600,000 an hour. When we talk about compensation, we ought to be talking about the entire compensation package, not just bonuses. And in this committee, we have made life a little difficult for top executives, particularly those who got TARP money. There is some social utility of that, beyond its obvious psychological benefits to those of us in the room. And that is, we have inspired these companies to pay back the TARP money far more quickly than they would have, and now we are focused on those who are too-big-to-fail. We are inconveniencing them to the greatest extent we can right now, and hopefully that will inspire them to break up so that we will have financial institutions, the demise of any one of which will not imperil the system. And so here we are, talking about their compensation. Last month, we imposed fees on those of over $50 billion in size. And I hope that they will get the message and become medium- sized institutions. The problem I have is in this effort to try to design compensation systems that do not incentivize excessive risk and that properly reward performance; I am not sure we can do it. I would hope that there would be none of these companies getting Federal subsidies or implicit Federal guarantee, in which case I don't think we have to do it. But my problem relates to a circumstance where, let's say, you are trading a portfolio. And your aim, of course, might be to have one great year and get an enormous bonus, because in this country, we tend to tally things up at the end of the calendar year and give you something valuable. Now it said, well, we will give you restricted stock. But that still provides a pretty good incentive to take the big risk and to get the big bonus unless you believe the risks you are taking: (A) will turn out poorly; and (B) will turn out so poorly that they dramatically affect the value of the entire company or that they inspire your other executives to take equally enormous risks. So assume that somebody is managing 1 percent of the company's money. They do not believe that their behavior will affect their colleagues, and they choose to take enormous risks. They pan out as of the end of the year, they get a gajillion shares of restricted stock. How are they disincentived by getting restricted stock? I don't know if there is time for the answer."
"The Chairman","Let's take 30 seconds for an answer. We don't have an overburdened day."
"Mr. Bebchuk","The Congressman is exactly right. For executives who manage a limited part of the company, like 1 percent, paying them with restricted stock does not give them incentives to avoid taking risks that might implode later on. The only way to do it would be to subject them to a clawback or to put their bonus in the bank that would be adjusted downward, not if the company does not do well on the whole, but when their own unit doesn't do well in the subsequent year."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Before I make my comments, I would ask unanimous consent to enter two studies into the record relative to the subject: one is entitled, ``Compensation in the Financial Industry'' by the Center on Executive Compensation; and the other is entitled, ``Bank CEO Incentives and the Credit Crisis'' from the Fisher College of Business from Ohio State University."
"The Chairman","Without objection, they will both be entered into the record. The gentleman is recognized."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Again, the American people were presented with a great outrage on Christmas Eve when this Administration decided, after tens of billions of dollars in losses, $110 billion now, now to announce unlimited taxpayer exposure to the Government- Sponsored Enterprises, those that are at the epicenter of the financial crisis, and to simultaneously--for all these losses that are costing the taxpayers all this money--to announce bonus structures of $6 million to each of the CEOs, $42 million in total for the executives. So again, as I said in my opening statement, I had hoped that we would have an opportunity to ask questions of the acting head of FHFA, Mr. Ed DeMarco, about this. And now I know the chairman in his comments said that we would have that opportunity next month. And he said that I am a patient man. Well, perhaps I am patient, but I am not sure, after the election results in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, that the American people are patient. They don't want answers a month from now, they want answers yesterday. And so I am disappointed, again, that for whatever reason, the American people are going to have to wait a month to find out about the bonuses at the Government-Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie and Freddie. The questions, again, I had were for Mr. DeMarco, I was going to ask, in light of the fact that the companies have averaged $11 billion in taxpayer subsidized losses over the last 5 quarters, how were the executives chosen to receive the bonuses? Since Mr. DeMarco isn't here, I doubt this panel can answer that question. But if somebody knows Mr. DeMarco, has spoken to him, maybe he has insight. If not, the second question I had for Mr. DeMarco is, why were the bonuses to be paid in cash? This is an Administration that says, no, we have to make sure that payments are made in stock. We have to have longer-term vesting dates for everybody else, apparently, except the Government-Sponsored Enterprises. So why cash for them and stock for everybody else? I was going to ask Mr. DeMarco that question. Again, I assume you haven't spoken to him. Is anybody qualified to answer that question on Mr. DeMarco's behalf? I assume not. I don't have to be convinced that there are pay structures that can be poorly designed that can cause companies to fail. I know that. I used to serve on a compensation committee of a publicly traded company, traded on the New York Stock Exchange. I at least have some experience with these matters. I have studied some of these issues. So I know that poorly designed compensation packages can cause companies to fail. You don't have to convince me of that. But you do have to convince me that any one company in America is too-big-to-fail. And guess what? If you don't bail them out with billions of dollars of taxpayer money, then you don't have to use the heavy hand of government to impose pay structures. I know the chairman has brought up, on a couple of occasions now, H.R. 1664. I have a couple of observations. Number one, if this Democratic Administration, this Democratic Senate, this Democratic House, were serious about doing something about Fannie and Freddie pay, I assume they could have done it by now. Second of all, as I think the chairman knows, this just didn't deal with the execs. This was a bill that would have regulated the pay of the janitor at Goldman Sachs and provided a role for the Congressional Oversight Panel in policy matters. And as a former member of that panel, I assure you they are singularly unqualified for the task. So again I don't see why--the basic proposition is this, again. In America, the principle ought to be what you do with your money is your business; what you do with taxpayer money is our business. And if your compensation structure causes you to fail, don't take money away from the farmers, school teachers, and the firemen to bail them out. The purpose of government is not to bail out. The purpose of government is not to place artificial limits on the American Dream. It is to preserve freedom. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Kansas. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I believe financial firms receiving taxpayer assistance should receive the most scrutiny with respect to their executive compensation practices. The most obvious and troubling case was AIG that provided $165 million in bonuses last year after taxpayers invested billions of dollars to keep the company solvent. I and others asked Ed Liddy, the CEO of AIG at the time, if he would encourage his employees to voluntarily return their bonuses. He said he would, and executives later agreed to pay back $45 million of $165 million of those bonuses. But in December of last year, we learned that only $19 million has been repaid. I have joined Representative Mike Capuano and others to write Secretary Geithner about this, especially in light of another round of bonuses to be issued to AIG in March of this year. If as much in taxpayer dollars were immediately recovered today and AIG were allowed to go through bankruptcy, I doubt those bonuses would be paid. So I hope we can get some answers soon. Taking a look at these AIG bonuses, Professor Bebchuk, it is obviously frustrating to taxpayers, because if it were not for them, AIG wouldn't be around to pay out those bonuses in 2009 and 2010. Are there specific things we should learn from the government's intervention with AIG as it relates to executive compensation, sir?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I think I would share your general sentiments that taxpayers have not charged financial firms sufficiently to make up for the substantial level of support that has been extended over the last year. And, more generally, I think that we can think about the pie that is being produced by the financial sector as being a result of contributions by taxpayers, by shareholders who provide capital, and by financial executives. And until now, the taxpayers have not been charging enough and shareholder interests have not been sufficiently protected. And the ultimate result of that is that financial executives--and AIG would be just one example, but more generally the sector--the financial executives might be getting an excessive fraction of this pie. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Ms. Minow, do you have any thoughts?"
"Ms. Minow","Yes, I do. In the future, I hope we never have to do another bailout, but if we do, I hope we impose some conditions before we turn over the money. And condition number one should be that you take a discount on any incentive compensation for the amount that was subsidized. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. Mr. Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I would like to emphasize two things that we did not do when we turned over money to these banks. First, we didn't relate giving them money to their behavior, not just with respect to the issue of compensation schemes, but also with respect to lending, which was the reason we were giving them money. That relates to the issue of jobs that has come up here a number of times. The fact that compensation went out meant there was less money inside the banks and therefore less ability or willingness to lend. The second point is that the U.S. taxpayer was not, when it gave the banks money, compensated for the risk that they bore. In some cases, we got repaid. But we ought to look at the transaction that Warren Buffet had with Goldman Sachs, which was an arm's-length transaction. If we wanted what would have been a fair compensation to the taxpayer, the bailouts would have reflected the same terms, and we would have gotten back a lot more. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. I am interested in better understanding how the culture of excessive lending, abusive leverage, and excessive compensation contributed to the financial crisis. This applies across-the-board for consumers who are in over their head with maxed-out credit cards and homes they couldn't afford, to major financial firms leveraged 35 to 1. Is there anything the government can and should do in the future to prevent a similar carefree and irresponsible mindset from taking hold and exposing our financial system to another financial crisis? Professor Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Two things. One is, I think in retrospect it is clear that leverage ratios were allowed to be too high and we need to regulate those to be at the lower level. And stopping short of that, the approach that the Administration is proposing of imposing levies on liabilities is a useful approach, and that approach could be useful going forward, regardless of the issue of making up for a past contribution of the taxpayers just in terms of charging financial firms for the risk that larger liabilities are posing to the system and to taxpayer. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. Ms. Minow, do you have any comments?"
"Ms. Minow","I agree with Professor Bebchuk. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","Yes. Three things very briefly. It is very important to change the incentives, which is the subject of this hearing. If you have incentives for excessive risk-taking, you will do it. These incentives are both at the individual level and the organizational level, which is why the too-big- to-fail bank issue is so critical. Even when we realign incentives, we will never do it perfectly, which is why we need constraints on leverage, on behaviors, and on products like derivatives. Finally, in order for our economic system to work, there has to be transparency. The way the system is set up right now, it is impossible for capital markets to exercise the discipline that is needed to make our system function well. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California."
"Mr. Campbell","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am going to throw out a few thoughts here on which I would like the panel's observations, or your thoughts. I am going to suggest to you that the executive compensation issues on which we all agree, the excessive risk, the excessive period, the short-term focus, etc., are more the symptom than the disease, and that if we treat the symptom we will be, at best, ineffective and, at worst, perhaps counterproductive. And that includes bills like the one the chairman talked about that was passed, whenever it was last year, the year before, and that the root of the problem--to get at the root of the problem, two things, one of which Ms. Minow already alluded to; and one is the greater ability for shareholders to express their displeasure with executives, the performance of the company, or executive compensation through the board by having an alternative vote of directors, given appropriate thresholds, so that ability is not abused. And so that would be one suggestion I would have as to get to the root of the problem. Rather than trying to micromanage the pay, give the shareholders a greater ability to express their displeasure, and the way that I think is appropriate is through the board rather than through direct control of the pay. And the second--and I know the chairman is going to have a hearing on this subject--is the short-term focus on pay, I would like to suggest, is perhaps simply a reflection on the short-term focus of the markets, and that maybe the problem is not so much the pay but the fact that ``buy and hold'' is dead and all kinds of other things like that, such that we are focused on quarterly earnings, quarterly earnings, and I too operated inside a public company at one time and it was all about this quarter. Everything was about this quarter. The whole world revolved around this quarter, next quarter, next year be damned. And that short term, that the short-term pay and excessive risk-taking in pay is simply a reflection of the short-term focus on the markets; that perhaps we should be looking at are there other things we can do to change that short-term focus on the markets? One of which I suggested is going to semi-annual financial statements rather than quarterly. Now, that is not a panacea, but there may be other things. So I will throw those out and love to hear the panel's thoughts on those thoughts."
"Mr. Bebchuk","The first issue, I completely agree with you, it is actually the main thesis of the book, ``Pay Without Performance,'' that Jesse Fried and I published 5 years ago, is that executive compensation is a symptom. It is a manifestation of underlying corporate governance problems, and all the panels have been discussing about changing governance arrangements in the ways you mentioned so as to produce better compensation outcomes, rather than micromanaging and dictating them."
"Mr. Stiglitz","Let me add two points. One of them is that I agree with your second point that the deeper problem of trying to make our markets less short-sighted has itself been a long- term problem, but it has gotten much worse. One of the things that can fix this is tax policy. A capital gains tax structure that encouraged longer-term holding and discouraged shorter- term holding is one of the few things we can do to move in that direction."
"Mr. Campbell","What would you define as ``long term?'' I am curious. It used to be 1 year."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I would define it as longer than 1 year; 2 to 5 years is longer term. The second point is that, while the reforms in corporate governance are the root of the problem that we have to deal with, we are always going to be imperfect on that. The result is that when it comes to institutions, like the financial institutions, which can put taxpayer money and our whole economic system at risk, we have to not only get at the root causes and reform corporate governance, but we actually also have to control, try to effect the actual behaviors."
"Mr. Campbell","Only basically for those systemically significant?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","Exactly, for those that represent a risk to our systemic system. But that may be broader than just the big banks."
"The Chairman","Before we get to the gentleman, particularly with her concern with investors, this is a very important question. I am just going to allow Ms. Minow to go beyond. Please don't be concerned by the red light. I think your input on this issue, the quarterly, semi-annual, is something we very much want."
"Ms. Minow","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that is a crucial question, and I think that one drives the other. I think the short-term focus on pay drives the short-term focus on numbers. It is really important to remember that the financial institutions themselves are very, very large shareholders, and so they look at their own quarterly performance in terms of the money that they invest, you know, so it creates a vicious circle. Clawbacks is one way of addressing that as an issue, because if you know that no matter, 10 years into the future if your numbers are revised, you are going to have to give the money back. That keeps people focused on the long term. But with regard to the issue of a holding period and looking at that in terms of taxes, I just want to remind the committee that the largest collection of investment capital of all, $6.3 trillion, is under ERISA, which is indifferent to tax consequences, so they are not going to be affected."
"The Chairman","Would you address the--because you represent investors, and I am attracted by the notion of not requiring quarterly reports, going to semi-annual. The counter argument is that the investors would feel maybe deprived of information. If the gentleman wouldn't mind, I would interested. We will probably get back to you. But I want to know your view on that, if that is all right with you."
"Mr. Campbell","Sure. That is fine."
"Ms. Minow","There is something sort of charming and poignant about making that suggestion in a world of Twitter and instant messages, everything else is becoming faster, and trying to slow that down. I think the fact is that one way or another, investors are going to get day-to-day information. We are very close to a point now where company financials, which are internally available on an almost real-time basis may someday become available to everybody. So I am not sure that really solves the problem, but I agree with you that is the right question to ask."
"Mr. Campbell","On clawback--"
"The Chairman","Take 10 seconds."
"Mr. Campbell","We will discuss that another day when we have another hearing. I just wanted one thing on a clawback that I wanted to ask real quick was, you said that if someone--if it is restated. I don't know how that changes the short-term focus. If I am paid entirely on what happens in the next 30 days, that would change the focus on accounting for it, perhaps, but if the consequences of that decision are very bad for a long term, you are not going to claw me back, so that doesn't change my behavior, does it?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Clawbacks cannot be based--to be effective they cannot be based only on accounting restatements. Even if the accounting was correct, but it turns out that the performance was illusory, the money should be adjusted."
"The Chairman","With the acquiescence of the charming and poignant gentleman from California, we will move on. But that is a question we will be dealing with, and I thank him for raising it. The gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Not only do I find myself agreeing with much of what Mr. Campbell had to say, but also with what David Stockman, the Director of OMB under the Reagan Administration, had to say the other day. I am pretty sure the Book of Revelation said that when I agree with both Mr. Campbell and Mr. Stockman, it is one of the signs of the Apocalypse. Mr. Stockman wrote the day before yesterday in the New York Times in op-ed, ``The economy desperately needs less of our bloated, unproductive and increasingly parasitic banking system.'' Make no mistake, the banking system has become an agent of destruction for the gross domestic product and of impoverishment for the middle class. Mr. Neugebauer asked earlier, why didn't we have a hearing about jobs? This is a hearing about jobs. How do we stop the excess, the vulgar excess that is not rewarding productive conduct, but is rewarding what economists call ``risk seeking,'' what Dr. Stockman called ``parasitic,'' that is taking money from the middle class and taking money from the real economy. And it is certainly undermining all that we need to be doing to build a sustainable economy that works for the middle class, works for ordinary Americans. I have a couple of questions. Is the focus on executive compensation part of a bigger problem? I don't really want to regulate compensation. I would much rather the market regulate compensation. But the way the market is supposed to work, where there are competitive forces in place, is that competition squeezes profits and squeezes costs, including compensation; and, instead, in the financial industry we have seen, despite the fact that there are 8,000 banks, or more than 8,000 banks-- and God only knows how many other kinds of entities that were doing bank-like things, and four, five, six big banks, profits in that sector ballooned to, a couple years ago, or metastasized a couple of years ago, to more than 40 percent of all corporate profits and compensation was almost twice what ordinary Americans were making, when historically it had been about what ordinary Americans made. Are competitive forces working? And why not? And second, where were the boards of directors? Of all the institutions that failed in the financial crisis, the board of directors has to be near the top. Gretchen Morgenson wrote an article, a column, 3 or 4 weeks ago that looked at what had happened to the board members from all the companies that had failed, and found out they had gone out to serve on other boards with no apparent diminution in their reputation. They were not tarnished in any way. There was an article in the New Republic that I read last night that was very critical of General Tommy Franks for not having captured or killed Osama bin Laden in Tora Bora in December of 2003. And without necessarily agreeing with everything that he had to say, there was a snide reference he had now retired and joined the board of directors at Bank of America and Chuck E. Cheese, which gave me the impression that boards of directors were really more a part of celebrity culture than they were corporate governance, that a board of directors meeting was a celebrity appearance. What can we do to make boards of directors a full-time job, a real job, and we don't have people on there who just treat it as a celebrity appearance?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I think, actually, making directors full-time employees is not a good idea because that would make them like insiders, would make them more dependent on the firm. What we need to do is obviously have them spend enough time, but the most important thing is to make them dependent on the shareholders in a way that would give them the right incentives and the kind of governance arrangements we were discussing. Arrangements that enabled shareholders to replace directors more easily would produce such an outcome. And this would be not replacing market outcomes, it would just enable the market to work better."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I want to make two comments on what you said. The first is when you were talking about that 40 percent of all corporate profits were in the financial sector, we have to remember that a lot of that was phantom profits; that is to say, they weren't real profits. That shows the difficulty of measuring performance in the financial sector. They have enormous discretion to create money, as it were, to create profits, and then later on to have losses, making all the more important the issue that we have been talking about of a long- term perspective. On the second point, I couldn't agree more. The fact that there is imperfect competition leads to sustainable above- normal profits, and that is particularly true in the big banks. The point is, there has been a large increase in concentration in the financial industry, and when it comes to particular issues like credit cards, it is very clear that they are engaged in anticompetitive practices that allow them to garner those profits and then, obviously distribute those profits to the officials."
"Ms. Minow","May I address the issue of the boards of directors? I feel very strongly about it. My company rates boards of directors like bonds, A through F. And we have really encouraged our clients, to include director and officer liability insurers, to raise the rates, sometimes to raise them to make it prohibitive for repeat offenders to continue to serve. And I will continue to try to do that. But when I first came into this business, O.J. Simpson was on five boards. He was on an audit committee. So we have made a little bit of progress. I think Tommy Franks probably was a better director than O.J."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New Jersey."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you all. Regarding your point, Professor Stiglitz, that Warren Buffet had an arm's-length transaction with Goldman Sachs, why don't you think the American people have that same arm's-length transaction? Was it just missteps by those in the Executive Branch?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","You might say ``missteps.'' They were very much taken into the view that at that point, they had to give money to the banks; because they thought it was imperative so that the banks could return to the usual role that they had had. But the government officials were captured in an intellectual sense by the banking system. It was a very big mistake."
"Mr. Lance","And do you see improvement with Federal officials at the moment in this area?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","If I look at the proposals that are being discussed recently, I see a very marked change. But if you looked at the bailouts that occurred in January, February, and the beginning of this year, they were as bad as those that occurred earlier."
"Mr. Lance","That is my point. And I began my questioning with what occurred at a prior time. But from what I have seen so far this year, there doesn't seem to me to be much of a change, and certainly in both last year, a year-and-a-half ago and in 2009, we the people, you and I together, the American people, were on one side and Warren Buffet with his arm's- length transaction was on another side, a much preferable side. And it seems to me we ought to learn from mistakes. And so far, I haven't seen any great learning curve in this regard. Ms. Minow, your comments perhaps in this area?"
"Ms. Minow","I have seen a learning curve. I think that the initial transaction, the initial bailout transaction was made in a moment of sheer panic, and it reflects that. But I think that the subsequent negotiations, and particularly the Administration's proposal of this week, do show that some lessons have been learned."
"Mr. Lance","Regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, how could these bonuses possibly have been given, in your opinion, as a matter of the court of public opinion, and what should we do?"
"Ms. Minow","Mr. Lance, if these people could be embarrassed, we wouldn't be here talking about them. They seem to be unembarrassable. So the court of public opinion doesn't seem to matter to them."
"Mr. Lance","So what should we do to make sure this doesn't happen again?"
"Ms. Minow","With regard to Fannie and Freddie?"
"Mr. Lance","Yes."
"Ms. Minow","I support the chairman's notion of essentially rebooting the entire concept."
"Mr. Lance","Professor Stiglitz, your views?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I agree. I think that we really have to reexamine the whole structure of the GSEs: the concept of an institution that was in the private sector, which is what they were, and yet seemed to have by some people's account this kind of public role, which is a very peculiar mixture. We have been talking about corporate governance, and it was a system of governance that was almost bound to fail."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you. Is my time expired?"
"The Chairman","No."
"Mr. Lance","Following up on Congressman Campbell, the short- term focus versus the long-term focus, isn't this true throughout the whole society? People don't let me finish a sentence."
"The Chairman","Would the gentleman hurry up, please?"
"Mr. Lance","I can never be as witty as the chairman. Isn't this the nature of society? And how are we going to overcome this? Ms. Minow, your point of view?"
"Ms. Minow","It is the nature of humanity, I am afraid, but I do think that we have some structural perversities in the system that can be regularized to calm things down."
"Mr. Stiglitz","We will never perfectly overcome it. But I think some of the things that we have been talking about are ways to mitigate some of the consequences, and we have to recognize that in some ways things have gotten worse; and that shows that whatever it was, you know, is not inevitable. Changes in the rules, the tax structures, and so forth do affect the extent to which there is that shortsightedness."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time,"
"Mr. Chairman",""
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Green","Thank you Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, we are dealing today with the irony of ironies, because most who opposed raising the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour were supporters and are supporters of maintaining a bonus structure that creates systemic risk. Now, the public may not understand systemic risk and perverse incentives and proprietary trading, but the public does understand this: that it took us 10 years to raise the minimum wage to $7.25 an hour. And if a person--and there is such a person--who gets a bonus of $69.7 million, it will take a minimum wage worker 4,622 years to make $69.7 million. Some things bear repeating, 4,622 years. The public understands that when you explain that the CEO or the CEOs of the biggest companies make more in 1 day than a minimum wage worker makes in a year, and this CEO has reason to envy the hedge fund manager who makes more in 10 minutes than the average worker makes in a year, and only pays 28 percent-- pardon me, 15 percent, capital gains, not ordinary income. I am one who supports allowing people to make bonuses as large as they can make, as long as they don't do it based upon perverse incentives that create systemic risk. And that is what this is all about--perverse incentives that create systemic risk. Let people make as much they can. But let's not allow them to create perverse incentives that will bring down this economy. Enough already with this notion that we should just let the economy collapse. If we had not bailed out AIG--and I did not want to do it, I had to hold my nose and close my eyes to cast a vote--but if we had not bailed out AIG, Bear Stearns, the auto industry, would the world be a better place today, Ms. Minow?"
"Ms. Minow","I think we could have done a better job of bailing them out, but I think we should have bailed them out."
"Mr. Green","Would the world have been a better place?"
"Ms. Minow","No."
"Mr. Green","Sir, Mr. Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I agree that the way we bailed them out leaves a lot to be desired."
"Mr. Green","Leaves a lot to be desired. Would the world have been a better place if we had not?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I think that at the time, the perspective was that we thought we had to."
"Mr. Green","I want speculation. If I may intercede, my time is limited. Would the world be a better place today? Give me your speculation."
"Mr. Stiglitz","My speculation is the world would be a better place if we had let AIG fail."
"Mr. Green","The auto industry, Bear Stearns, and AIG?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I think we were forced to have some kind of a bailout for some of these."
"Mr. Green","Mr. Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I feel the world would have been better had we done a ``partial bailout,'' for example. Having some of AIG's counterparties--"
"Mr. Green","If we had taken a laissez-faire, hands-off attitude and let things go, would the world be a better place today?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Compete laissez-faire, no. It would not have been a better place if we just took our attention completely away from those firms. The answer is no."
"Mr. Green","Just laissez-faire, let the world go wherever it is going."
"Mr. Bebchuk","That would have been a worse outcome."
"Mr. Green","Do you understand that we have Members of Congress who are advocating we should have just let the world go, just left it alone? Can you imagine where we would be if we had done nothing? Is it irresponsible to do just nothing at a time of crisis like this? Ma'am?"
"Ms. Minow","Yes."
"Mr. Green","Sir?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I agree it would be irresponsible."
"Mr. Green","Is it irresponsible to do nothing?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","It is not the right thing to do."
"Mr. Green","It is not the right thing to do. All right. I will help you. It is irresponsible. Friends, we at some point have to become adults about what we are dealing with. We are talking about perverse incentives that create systemic failure. Give me an example, please, ma'am, of a perverse incentive that creates systemic failure, please."
"Ms. Minow","Certainly. In the subprime industry, the individuals were paid on the number of transactions rather than the quality of transactions. So they had a perverse incentive to create as many transactions as possible."
"Mr. Green","Mr. Chairman, may I, with unanimous consent, ask that each other witness just give one example of perverse incentive?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","The fact that the incentives in the financial sector were based on pay as measured by performance, whether it was through excessive risk-taking, increasing beta, or whether it was the result of greater efficiency, increasing alpha."
"Mr. Bebchuk","The fact that the top executives at Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were able to get in 2006 very large bonuses based on earnings which then they were able to keep and they were not clawed back, even though all those earnings, and more, were evaporated in the subsequent period."
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Missouri."
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a number of questions so I am going to try to ask them quickly. But before I ask the questions, I was appointed to this committee in 2005 with Mr. Green--I had to just recheck--and my recollection is that at the time, Mike Oxley was the chairman of this committee and our current chairman was the ranking member. And one of the first things we dealt with when I came on this committee was some proposed reform, assuming by Mr. Oxley, maybe both Mr. Oxley and Mr. Frank, dealing with Fannie and Freddie. I was talking to a reporter 2 days ago who said one of the problems in Washington is that the truth doesn't matter; it is whether or not you can say a lie over and over and over again so that everybody buys it. So my concern is that history has been a little distorted, because Mr. Oxley proposed trying to deal with the issue of Fannie and Freddie compensation, and as I recall, they didn't get any support from the White House. If I have misspoken, I would like to be corrected."
"The Chairman","If the gentleman would yield, Mr. Oxley's quote in the Financial Times was that what he received from the White House was the ``the finger salute.''"
"Mr. Cleaver","I take that to mean I am correct."
"Mr. Bachus","Would the gentleman further yield?"
"Mr. Cleaver","Certainly."
"Mr. Bachus","Chairman Frank opposed that legislation."
"The Chairman","Would the gentleman further yield?"
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New Jersey and the gentleman from Texas derided it as very ineffective and weak, and it failed in the Senate. I voted for the bill in the House and in the committee. When it got to the House Floor and the Republican leadership put in an amendment restricting affordable housing, unrelated to the structural organization of Fannie and Freddie, I then voted against that. But I voted for the bill until they put that amendment in. I thank the gentleman and he will get an additional minute for yielding."
"Mr. Cleaver","The point I was trying to make, as somebody had said earlier, had transferred the conversation to Fannie and Freddie, and that we had not tried to deal with compensation with Fannie and Freddie. I wanted to try to clear it up as this reporter told me. It doesn't matter; people are going to continue to say it, just like we will hear over and over again that I guess President Obama started the bailouts. But where I want to go now is that the too-big-to-fail is a problem because I think they understand clearly that they have what it takes to take what we have. And if that is the attitude they have, which I think it is, we are going to lose. My questions are though--and I don't know the answer to this, and in this committee you probably should know the answer before you ask the question--but did the firms with better compensation perform better? Those with the better compensation structure, did they end up performing better? Did they get into trouble? Do any of you know that answer?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","This is a subject that still needs to be investigated. What makes it not a straightforward question to answer is the question is, what does it mean to be compensated better? So if you believe that better compensation is one that provides less incentives to focus on short term, then you have to measure those dimensions and then to find how they have correlated with performance, and that is not something that has yet been kind of fully done."
"Mr. Cleaver","Don't you think that would be a worthy project to--"
"Mr. Bebchuk","Definitely."
"Mr. Stiglitz","Part of the problem is that almost all of the big banks, those that are too-big-to-fail, had similar compensation schemes, so that you probably won't be able to get clear results. The differences were not big enough to overwhelm the perverse incentives that really dominated the whole industry."
"Mr. Cleaver","I was wondering if you could do an overlay with what happened with the mortgages--the banks, mortgage companies, that did not go into the subprime scam even though they didn't make as much money. Now, if you look at their books, they did better. And so the question that I raise was based on what I have seen with the subprime industry. And do you think that the--particularly the Wall Street so- called investment banks will change their compensation structure without congressional legislative encouragement? Ms. Minow?"
"Ms. Minow","As I discussed in my testimony, the fact that following the bailout just over the last year, they have essentially poured gasoline on the fire of excessive compensation suggests to me that they need a much stronger message from Congress."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I agree. There will be some cosmetic changes, but the question is, will the depth of those changes be anywhere near sufficient to address the kinds of concerns that have been discussed this morning?"
"Mr. Cleaver","My final question. In talking with an investment banker in my district in Kansas City, Missouri, I found out that what the investment bankers like to do is--not the people out trying to make the deals, but the execs--give bonuses that stretch over a number of years. And my assumption is that they invest, you know, they give a bonus over the next 4 or 5 years, and then they invest what they gave, they keep and invest what they gave. And so I am wondering whether or not that kind of system should be outlawed. The executives don't want to give compensation, all compensation in cash up front. They want to stretch it out over the years. Do you understand when I am saying?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","Let me make one comment, which is they are very creative in trying to subvert the intention--that we have been concerned with--of getting better incentive systems. One of the concerns is that, if you look in more detail across corporations, much of what is called ``incentive pay'' is not incentive pay. It is a charade. If you look at overall performance and overall compensation, they are much less closely linked than the name would suggest. That was evidenced in the AIG case where, when they began to have problems, they just changed the name from ``performance pay'' to ``retention pay.'' They are very clever in undermining what we are really concerned about."
"Mr. Cleaver","I know you weren't trying to suggest this, but it almost sounds like you were saying they are trying to trick Congress and the public. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Ohio."
"Ms. Kilroy","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you to all of the witnesses for your thoughtful testimony. And I thank my colleagues for their questions and discussion that we have had since then. It has been very useful and thought-provoking, and still the whole issue is still difficult to get your arms around here. Despite the financial crisis in the fall of 2008, and the resulting bailouts and further infusions of cash along the way, here we are again with the public outraged and Wall Street handing out this year a record $140 billion in bonuses. When we take a look at that kind of money and try to put it in some kind of perspective, in context, according to the Washington Examiner, this is 10 percent of the entire U.S. deficit, or 3 times the amount budgeted for education, or 4 times the amount for Homeland Security. It is vastly more money than we have pledged for the reconstruction of Haiti and an amount that could prevent millions, hundreds of millions of home foreclosures. So it is no wonder that hardworking Americans who thought, as was brought out in questioning, that okay, we need to bail out Wall Street, we don't want to go over the cliff, and understood it was their hard-earned dollars that were going towards that, nevertheless wanted to see something other than banks buying up banks and handing themselves out bonuses as a result of trading activity, rather than making those loans or renegotiating those mortgages. So families understand that they have lost jobs and they have lost homes, and bankers still are getting billions of dollars, and we still haven't gotten a hold over all of the issues about the risky behavior that has brought us here to this date. Now, I listen to the bankers, and sometimes they tell me that they are offended that we are even talking about regulating their bonuses and their compensation, that we don't understand that they are the best and the brightest, or that it has to be now for retention; otherwise they would, I don't know, go do I don't know what. I get offended when they tell me they are the best and the brightest, because I happen to think that there are a lot of people who are very bright and very good. In fact, the best are involved and teach for AmeriCorps, in our public schools, or in our hospitals, or social workers, and they seem to work very hard with substantially less pay. So, you know, I serve on the Homeland Security Committee, and we had the Salahis in last week and they were all primped and dressed up and made up and these gate crashers struck me as incredibly self-centered and without regret, and sometimes, like some of the people that I hear saying that we can't touch their pay, they don't get how angry hard-working Americans are and how people in central Ohio think pay should somehow relate to your productivity. And they don't get it that when you ruin an economy, you get these kind of bonuses. So, you know, I know we have been around this a few times already, but what advice do you have for us so that we can fairly compensate people and try to define performance? And if the issue is, Ms. Minow, as you suggested, the central issue, board governance, if boards have this attitude that we all deserve that in the financial sector, that kind of compensation, how do we really get into, you know, changing the practices, both in order to protect us from further damage down the road, and to have a better handle on corporations and their governance?"
"Ms. Minow","The focus on the post-Enron reform legislation, Sarbanes-Oxley, and the regulations has all been on what I call the supply side of corporate governance, what managers have to do, what accountants have to do. We have not really focused on the demand side, on what shareholders have to do. And the fact is that you should have in here the heads of all the mutual funds, the Assistant Secretary responsible for ERISA, these are people who routinely vote in favor of these boards of directors, in favor of these pay plans because no one is looking at them, no one is paying attention to them. I think we need to remind them what fiduciary obligation is all about and that it is in their economic interest to look at pay as a risk factor, and I think that would make a big difference."
"Mr. Stiglitz","I think the reforms in corporate governance that we have been talking about, both on the demand and supply side, are essential, but in the end I think they won't go far enough, for two reasons. One, those aspects of the structure of the compensation schemes that put at risk the national economy and the taxpayers' money have to be regulated in a whole variety of ways. The second point is that the tax structure as a whole has to be designed better to address the sense of equity in our system. The arguments that have been made before, that more progressive taxation or that taxing capital gains would have adverse incentive effects, are just wrong. We can have a fair tax system that actually would encourage greater efficiency."
"Mr. Bebchuk","I would put the $140 billion figure that you mentioned in context, not just by comparing it to the Homeland Security budget, but I would compare it, that would be the most relevant comparison, to what shareholders have received during this period and what taxpayers have received during this period. So what is disproportionate is the $140 billion relative to the contribution of the financial sector to the performance of the economy over the last decade. If you look at the numbers, you see that shareholders in the financial sector over the last 10 years still see somewhat negative returns over this long period. And we know about taxpayers. So what we need is to reallocate the pie, so to speak, in a more efficient way between shareholders, taxpayers, and financial executives, and the way to do it would be for shareholders to have stronger rights so that they can claim their share of the pie, and for taxpayers to begin going forward charging banks adequately for the support the taxpayers are providing."
"The Chairman","The time of the gentleman has expired. I just want to makes an announcement to others. And this again, the gentleman from California, Mr. Campbell, the gentleman from Michigan, Mr. Peterson, there has been a lot of interest in corporate governance. We tried to minimize the involvement of it with the financial regulatory programs. We want to deal with that. We are going to get into the corporate governance issue, and that includes, by the way, I would just say to Ms. Minow, jurisdiction being what it is, I don't think I can summon the Assistant Secretary of Labor before this committee who was the ERISA guy or woman. But we are going to continue with one of the things that the SEC did, which is to require that all these institutions publish how they vote. As you know, there was a lot of resistance to that. And the fact that it was kind of partisan is true, so it was imposed on the mutual funds, and we believe it should be imposed on any fiduciary. If you are the owner of the shares in your own right, you have a privacy right. But if you own shares as a fiduciary, we, I hope, will pass legislation that will require that you have to make public how you voted on all the proxies. We can't force them to do more, but I think that would be useful."
"Ms. Minow","No question about it. I would be delighted and I hope you will allow me to come back and testify in support of that."
"The Chairman","And we will be inviting people to that hearing. Before we get to the last questioner, the gentleman from Florida, one other question, I talked to the gentleman from Alabama, if I have just like 2 minutes, unanimous consent to say, one of the things we are told is well, we are given two arguments on compensation. One, we will all go to some other country. Well, the rest of the world is getting tighter than us. So now the argument is okay, we will go do something else. We will go into some other profession and won't you be sorry, all billion of us will no longer be trading CDSs with each other. My response is in part, well, I am not sure where you are going to go for that kind of money. But two, what if they did, if, in fact, fewer of the very brilliant people that the gentleman from Ohio was referring to decided that there was no longer enough money to be made in bond trading and went into other lines of work, would that be a social loss? Not that we would drive them away, but is that a by-product that we have to try to avoid?"
"Ms. Minow","I was supportive of the remarks you made on this subject earlier this week, Mr. Chairman, when you talked about scheduling this hearing. And in my written testimony, I said I would love to see the demand curve on that one if all of the Wall Street guys rush out into the market. I think the pay package--"
"The Chairman","Well, I think it is twofold. One, what is the demand curve and, two, even if there is a demand what is the social loss? Professor Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","I addressed that in my written testimony. I said that not only is there a misallocation of financial capital, but there is also a misallocation of human capital that is costing our society even more. It would be a good thing for our society to reallocate this human capital."
"The Chairman","Professor Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","There is a very interesting study by Claudia Goldin and Larry Katz from Harvard, and they track what happened to Harvard college graduates over a long period of time, and they report that a huge increase in the fraction of the class, the best and the brightest, they go into finance relative to what happened 30 years ago when larger numbers were going into science, engineering, medicine, and so forth. And this partly reflected response to market incentives, and now that we are reconsidering the contribution of financial to the wellbeing of the economy, we might conclude that having a smaller fraction going into finance might not be a bad thing."
"The Chairman","Thank you. Does the gentleman from Alabama want to take 2 minutes?"
"Mr. Bachus","Yes, I do want to say this. I think we are dealing with executive compensation, and I think one thing that does trouble most Americans and Members on both sides of the aisle is that some of the very large banks do borrow very cheaply from the Fed, and that is taxpayer subsidized in one way or the other. Whether they invest them in Treasury bonds or carry trade, or whether they use them to trade and make additional profits, the original premise was that money would be loaned, and it is not. Now, I will say this: The flip side of the argument is that they are using those trading profits to cover some of their lending losses, and in some ways that makes the banks stronger and it may avoid the government having to come up and pick up liability. You know, that is one of their answers. Another one that they say is that there are no borrowers; they can't find borrowers who are qualified. Now, I talk to many people back in Alabama, and they say when they deal with the large banks, they say they are not interested in loaning someone $200,000. They are interested in $100 million deals. So I think that is a real problem. Particularly as banks get bigger and bigger, they are not lending on Main Street. They are lending to large corporations, but smaller businesses can't get loans. And I do think the American people do believe that by being able to borrow cheaply from the Fed and some of the guarantees that have been extended, that money is finding its way into compensation, which gives the appearance of being excessive. And so I think these are valid concerns. And also, the last concern, and I will close with this, and I think it is a concern we all have, as they do this trading they tend to be going back and doing what got them in trouble in the first place, and that is speculating, leveraging, and what happens, do we get right back into the problem we had? And if they are going to get in trouble, they say, you know, you don't want us to make bad loans. That is true. We also don't want them to make trades that are risky. And if anything, the trades benefit themselves, proprietary trading, whereas the lending at least gets the economy going."
"The Chairman","If the gentleman would yield, if they can make enough money doing everything but lending that may be a contributing factor to not lending. We will have an all-day hearing on Friday, February 5th, with borrowers and regulators and lenders, and we want to get into this question about why more loans aren't being made. It is a bipartisan concern. And I do think it is legitimate to inquire to the extent to which other opportunities to make a lot of money displace lending, either directly or indirectly. Let me just now--"
"Mr. Bachus","And I do think one answer is to look at whether they are lending, and if they are not lending, the government, if they are going to make money available it ought to be to those institutions that are lending and lending on Main Street, and put some competition out there ."
"The Chairman","Yes. And that will be our February 5th hearing. The last questions will be from the gentleman from Florida, Mr. Grayson."
"Mr. Grayson","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In capitalism, winners have to win and losers have to lose. People are normally rewarded for success and they are punished for failure. Now, we went through an experience where, between the middle of 2007 and the end of 2008, that 18-month period, we lost $12 trillion in our country's net worth. According to the Federal Reserve figures, the net worth of America dropped from $62 trillion to $50 trillion, by 20 percent in the last 18 months of the Bush Administration. Is there any sign since these bailouts began that the institutions and the individuals on Wall Street and in major banks who were responsible for the decisions that led to that loss of $12 trillion actually were held accountable for it? Any sign at all? Professor Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","No."
"Mr. Grayson","Ms. Minow?"
"Ms. Minow","No."
"Mr. Grayson","Professor Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I think some of them lost their positions. Some of them lost money, but by and large they have not been held sufficiently accountable. And the most important thing is we don't yet have incentives going forward that would make people do the right thing in terms of risk-taking."
"Mr. Grayson","Well, you raise an interesting point. I actually asked the head of AIG, who actually were the people responsible for their losses that led to the government bailout and he wouldn't even tell me their names. Isn't it possible that the people who actually led to this financial disaster, not only in America, but around the world, are still doing the same jobs, very often down the block from where they were before?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I think some of the key people did lose their positions. So some of the top people at AIG are no longer there. But I think that I agree with your sentiment that probably they have not been held sufficiently accountable. And most importantly, many of them have been able to pocket and still keep large amounts of money that were based on results that they had in 2006 and 2007, which were disastrously reversed in 2008."
"Mr. Grayson","What does it mean for a capitalist country like the United States if over a long period of time, failure is rewarded and capital destruction is rewarded? What does that mean in the long run? Ms. Minow?"
"Ms. Minow","Bankruptcy."
"Mr. Grayson","For the country?"
"Ms. Minow","For the country."
"Mr. Grayson","Professor Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","It obviously has a very adverse effect on the efficiency of our economy. I have called it an ersatz capitalism, where you socialize the losses and you privatize the gains. That leads to distorted behavior, which is why a lot of what we are talking about is about going forward, not just dealing with the past. Unless we correct these incentive problems at the organizational and individual level, we are likely to have exactly the same kind of problem again."
"Mr. Grayson","And Mr. Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","I really agree. The difference between what Professor Stiglitz called ersatz capitalism and real capitalism is very substantial and costly for the country's well-being."
"Mr. Grayson","Now, on Wall Street the gearing, the ratio between assets and equity is often 10 to one or more, right? Professor Stiglitz."
"Mr. Stiglitz","If it were only 10 to one, we would think of that as very conservative. It has been up to 30 or 40 to one. That is an example of excessive risk-taking with very little social benefit that you can associate with that high level of risk-taking."
"Mr. Grayson","Well, let's say it was only 10 to one. Isn't it true that every dollar that is paid on executive compensation means $10 less in loan ability for these institutions, the ability to lend out money to the rest of America? Professor?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","Yes. We were talking about that at the beginning of the hearing, that money that goes out in bonuses is money that is not available in, you might say, the net worth of the bank and therefore not available as the basis of the leverage that the bank can lend out."
"Mr. Grayson","Now, do the managers of these institutions on Wall Street and the big banks around the country have any incentive all in an economy that is based on incentives like America's, any incentive at all to economize on their own compensation? Ms. Minow?"
"Ms. Minow","No, I think it is the sky's the limit."
"Mr. Grayson","Professor Stiglitz?"
"Mr. Stiglitz","The incentives are distorted. We have been talking about what would happen if they had long run incentives. If they had more effective long run incentives, then of course they would say if they keep the net worth of the company larger, it will make larger profits in the long run. Therefore, in the long run the company is doing better, and they will get an appropriate return. But that is not the way the current incentive structures are designed."
"Mr. Grayson","Mr. Bebchuk?"
"Mr. Bebchuk","They don't have the right incentives. Privately they would be better off paying, having larger compensation even at some cost to the shareholders. We have seen this in firms that were making decisions whether to return TARP funding, and it seems that some executives were eager to return TARP funding, even when that was costly to their shareholders, as evidenced by market reactions, in order to get out of the restrictions the TARP funding had on the compensation."
"Mr. Grayson","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","I thank the witnesses. We will take further testimony, particularly on the question of how you deal with short-termers and some of these things that are ongoing and also on what I think I will title the ``so what'' part of this, which is, oh, if you don't let us make all this money, we will go off and do other things. We know they are not going to England. In fact, one of our major bank CEOs--we don't need to mention him here--complained to the Chancellor of the Exchequer that they were driving away his potential investment in Canary Wharf because of their compensation restrictions. So they really are trying to play us off against each other. I will be in Davos next week, and one of the things I will most focus on is reinforcing this agreement, both with compensation and regulation, that we are not going to be played off, and I think in fact America will wind up being a little bit more lax than many of the others. So then the question is, okay, we will go off and engage in other lines of work, and maybe if we got some more family physicians and less people doing mathematical models, it wouldn't be such a bad thing. Thank you all.   "
