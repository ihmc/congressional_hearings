Speaker,Speech
Chairman Kanjorski," This hearing of the Subcommittee on Capital Markets, Insurance, and Government Sponsored Enterprises will come to order. Pursuant to committee rules, each side will have 15 minutes for opening statements. Without objection, all members' opening statements will be made a part of the record.
    Today we meet to examine the operations of credit rating agencies and approaches for improving the regulation of these entities. Given the amount of scrutiny that these matters have garnered in recent months, I expect that we will have a lively and productive debate.
    The role of the major credit rating agencies in contributing to the current financial crisis is now well documented. At the very best, their assessments of packages of toxic securitized mortgages and overly complex structured finance deals were outrageously optimistic. At the very worst, these ratings were grossly negligent.
    In one widely reported internal e-mail exchange between two analysts at Standard and Poor's in April of 2007, one of them concludes that the deals ``could be structured by cows and we would rate it.'' I therefore fear that in many instances the truth lies closer to the latter option, rather than the former possibility.
    Moreover, if we were to turn the tables today and rate the rating agencies, I expect that most members of the Capital Markets Subcommittee would agree that during the height of the securitization boom, the rating agencies were AA, if not AAA failures. Clearly, they flunked the class on how to act as objective gatekeepers to our capital markets.
    Along with the expressions of anger, outrage, and blame that we will doubtlessly hear today, I hope that we can also explore serious proposals for reform. Unless we can find a way to improve the accountability, transparency, and accuracy of credit ratings, the participants in our capital markets will discount and downgrade the opinions of these agencies going forward.
    One could hope that the agencies would do a better job in policing themselves. But if past is prologue, we cannot take that gamble. This time their failures were not in isolated, case-by-case instances. Instead, they were systemic problems across entire classes of financial products and throughout entire industries. Stronger oversight and smarter rules are therefore needed to protect investors and the overall credibility of our markets.
    As a start, the rating agencies must face tougher disclosure and transparency requirements. For example, investors receive too little information on rating methodologies. The financial crisis has illustrated the danger flawed methodologies pose to the system. If methodologies remain hidden, there exists no check by which to expose their weaknesses.
    In addition to establishing an office dedicated to the regulation of rating agencies within the Securities and Exchange Commission, oversight must also focus more intently on surveillance of outstanding ratings. The industry has done an inadequate job of downgrading debt before a crisis manifests or a company implodes. Moreover, we must examine how we can further mitigate the inherent conflicts of interest that rating agencies face.
    In this regard, among our witnesses is a subscriber pay agency. This alternative model is worthy of our consideration. At one time, all rating agencies received their revenues from subscribers, but they evolved into an issuer pay model in response to market developments. I look forward to understanding how a subscriber pay agency succeeds in today's marketplace.
    Additionally, the question of rating agency liability is of particular interest to me. The First Amendment defense that agencies rely upon to avoid accountability to investors for grossly inaccurate ratings is generally a question for the courts to determine, but Congress can also have its say on these matters. Much like the other gatekeepers in our markets, namely lawyers and auditers, we could choose to impose some degree of public accountability for rating agencies via statute. The view that agencies are mere publishers issuing opinions bears little resemblance to reality, and the threat of civil liability would force the industry to issue more accurate ratings.
    In sum, the foregoing financial crisis requires us to reevaluate how rating agencies conduct their business, even though we enacted the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act just 3 years ago. As this Congress considers a revised regulatory structure in a broader context, this segment of our markets also needs to be examined and transformed. By considering proposals aimed at better disclosure, real accountability, and perhaps even civil liability, we can advance that debate today and ultimately figure out how to get the regulatory fit just right.
    Now, I will recognize the gentleman from New Jersey for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Garrett," And I thank the chairman for holding this important hearing today.
    I believe it is critical, as he says, that this subcommittee conduct proper oversight of the credit rating agencies and examine all of the issues surrounding the role that they played, if any, in the lead-up to the Nation's current situation.
    I would like to thank all the witnesses of the panel attending. Unfortunately, we don't have a representative from the SEC. That's the government agency tasked with overseeing and regulating the NRSROs here with us to testify.
    And so I feel it's essential that before this committee does formally consider any regulatory reforms regarding the rating agencies, that we should at some point hear directly from the SEC, as to what, if any, additional powers or changes they see necessary.
    Over the past decade, we have seen a large increase in the role that credit rating agencies have in determining the creditworthiness of financial institutions and different type of securities. Whether it is corporate, municipal, or structured finance, any entity seeking to assure investors of the quality of the debt must receive a good grade from one of these entities.
    And so investors have become increasingly, and too often solely, reliant on the use of these ratings in determining the safety and soundness of an investment. This situation, like many of the other problems of this financial crisis, has, in large part been created by government policy itself.
    For literally hundreds of Federal and State government statutes and regulations, there are specific government requirements mandating certain grades from approved agencies. It is this formal requirement that provides an implicit stamp of approval, if you will, to the investors.
    When an investor sees that the government has required a specific grade to make a ``safe investment,'' it basically reinforces the belief that any investment attaining such a grade is a safe investment.
    But to its credit, the SEC recognizes this problem, as well, and they are moving to address it. So in December of last year, the SEC proposed several new rules, one of which would reduce the reliance on the NRSROs' ratings in the SEC's regulations.
    I believe it was Commissioner Casey who had it right when she said, ``These requirements have served to elevate NRSRO ratings to a status that does not reflect their actual purpose, much less the limitations of credit ratings.''
    So Congress really should try to follow suit and reexamine all the areas where statutes mandate the ratings of NRSROs. Credit ratings are only one piece of the puzzle--I think we'll hear that from the panel--in determining creditworthiness. Investors must be encouraged to do their own due diligence in evaluating issuer credit quality.
    Now, one of the other areas that needs to be addressed is increased competition within the industry, and I hear from the panel that they may be amenable to that, as well.
    The 2006 Act made a number of significant improvements to the process. Unfortunately, the law was just beginning to be implemented at the time when the financial system started to hemorrhage; and the very worthwhile goals of the 2006 laws, as far as fostering more competition, enhancing transparency, and increasing accountability may still be achieved.
    So two things I do not think Congress or the SEC should do are to eliminate specific types of pay models or prescribe exact analytics that NRSROs must use. This would go against the intent of the legislation by providing a further reduction in competition and increasing investor reliance on the ratings.
    In regards to competition, a recent rule issued that also runs contrary to the goals of 2006 is from the Fed, the requirement that any securities used as collateral in their Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, the TALF, must have an A-1 rating from a major NRSRO. So this major NRSRO term is entirely new and refers to the Big Three rating agencies.
    While I assume that the Fed added this requirement due to the perceived better quality of the Big Three firms, I would remind the Fed that the Big Three rated Lehman, unfortunately, as A-1 on the day of bankruptcy.
    Another area in which I would like to see increased competition is the manner in which credit quality is determined.
    And I know that some of my friends on the committee would like to demonize credit default swaps as a horrific gambling bet made by fat cats smoking cigars and sitting in luxurious boardrooms, but the fact of the matter is, credit default swaps are actually additional measures of assessing the creditworthiness of different corporations or securities, and during the height of the financial panic and collapse of many major firms, credit default swaps provided a more accurate gauge or risk that some of the credit rating agencies.
    So in conclusion, Mr. Chairman, I believe that the government must continue to wean investors off being solely reliant on credit ratings and encourage them to conduct their own more due diligence.
    I do greatly appreciate the chairman holding this very important hearing, and I look forward to all the witnesses' testimony today.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Garrett.
    You have heard the bells. We have about 5 minutes remaining on the first vote. There are three votes. We estimate it will take us about 25 minutes.
    So we will stand in recess until we complete those votes and reassemble here immediately thereafter.
    [recess]
"
Chairman Kanjorski," The committee will reconvene.
    I now recognize the gentleman from New York, Mr. Ackerman, for 3 minutes.
"
Mr. Ackerman," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    This is not the first time that the committee has explored the role and the future of credit rating agencies in our financial system.
    Time and again, we have heard from the agencies that their ratings were really sound, despite the billions of dollars in losses that investors realized on so-called AAA rated mortgage-backed securities.
    I would disagree with them. For mortgage-backed securities to collateralized debt obligations and the structured finance market, the bond markets, the types of products that receive inaccurate ratings in the markets in which those products were traded are far too vast to support the argument that the overly favorable ratings of 2006 and 2007 were just a fluke. Clearly, a systemic approach to the ratings process is needed.
    Mr. Castle and I have introduced legislation that would institute such an approach. The bill, H.R. 1181, would require the SEC to promulgate rules that would determine the types of structured finance investments that are eligible to receive NRSRO ratings from credit rating agencies that have been designated as nationally recognized statistical rating organizations.
    The bill also defines the credit rating agency to which NRSRO-rated finance products must adhere. You cannot accurately predict performance of newer products that have no long-term track records. That doesn't mean that you can't sell them.
    To be clear, we do not want to stifle creativity, and nothing in our bill restricts the ability of originators to continue to securitize less predictable or riskier products.
    The legislation permits NRSROs to continue to provide ratings for securities that do not meet the proposed NRSRO criteria, as long as they are not designated as NRSRO ratings. These, you know, are the ratings upon which pension fund managers, who are collectively tasked with managing the nest eggs of millions of Americans, rely.
    I'm also concerned by the assertion of many of the credit rating agencies that their ratings are mere opinions, and therefore, are protected by the First Amendment.
    Of course, I might be more inclined to support the agencies' position if the companies didn't have an implied government license, and by their financial relationships with issuers. In my view, the often inappropriately favorable ratings that the agencies assign to products issued by their clients amounts to nothing more than paid advertisements and endorsements, not an expression of opinion.
    I hope that the subcommittee will continue to work towards restoring transparency and objectivity to the credit rating agencies, as the future of our financial markets depends upon it.
    I look forward to hearing from our expert witnesses, and I yield back the balance of my time.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," The Chair recognizes Mr. Bachus for 3 minutes.
"
Mr. Bachus," I thank the chairman.
    It's not normally my tendency to be overly critical, but I'm going to make an exception in this case.
    I think surely everyone now recognizes that the credit rating agencies have failed, and failed spectacularly and broadly. Inaccurate rating agency risk assessments are one of the fundamental factors, in my opinion, in the global financial crisis, and effective correction action must address these shortcomings.
    As Mr. Ackerman alluded to, the rating agencies say that these assessments or ratings are opinions, predictive opinions, and I think from a legal standpoint, that's true. But in the real world, that's not reality.
    The SEC special examination report of the three major credit rating agencies uncovered significant weaknesses in their rating practices for mortgage-backed securities, and also called into question the impartiality of their ratings.
    As the SEC report detailed, the rating agencies failed to accurately rate the creditworthiness of many structured financial products. Investors and the government both over-relied on these inaccurate ratings, which undoubtedly contributed to the dramatic collapse of the United States and its financial market, or near-collapse.
    In order to avoid future meltdowns, we must return to a time where the rating agencies are not deemed a valid substitute for thorough investor due diligence. My own view is that while the SEC report did not address municipal securities, the rating agency practices were also significant factors in the problems that plagued municipal issuers.
    The Federal Government must also share the blame for fostering over-reliance on rating agencies. The Federal Reserve's recent designation of certain rating agencies as major nationally recognized statistical rating organizations implies a government stamp of approval that does not exist.
    What we have is what I would call, and others have called, a government-sanctioned duopoly. I think that's a mistake.
    As we move forward with regulatory reform proposals, the committee should consider removing from Federal laws, regulations, and programs all references that require reliance on ratings. The SEC also should take action to remove similar references in its own rules as quickly as possible.
    At a minimum, the committee should consider changing NRSROs from nationally recognized to nationally registered statistical rating organizations, to further reduce the appearance of government support or approval.
    As Mr. Garrett said, I think credit swap derivatives have been an accurate predictor of credit risk, and more so than credit ratings, and the credit ratings have become almost--well, I won't go into all that, but what I would say, this should give us caution in discouraging the use of credit default swaps, and it's critical that this committee doesn't restrict these CDS contracts in the marketplace as we consider broader regulatory reform.
    Let me close by saying, to say what has occurred in the marketplace since 2006 has been volatile and frightening is an understatement. Correcting inadequacies of the credit rating process is absolutely essential to restoring investor confidence.
    There must be further changes in the current rating system to respond to very serious concerns expressed by investors, market participants, and policymakers alike.
    I look forward to hearing from the witnesses concerning these matters.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you, Mr. Bachus.
    Next, we will hear from Mr. Castle for 2 minutes.
"
Mr. Castle," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Credit rating agencies occupy a very important place in the world of finance, as we all know. Therefore, I think this committee needs to more fully understand things about the industry and its practices.
    Our present circumstance leads us to many questions.
    How did the agencies repeatedly miss the mark on structured finance products only to have to lower ratings or watch a record number of these products default?
    What experience in history did the agencies have with some of the products they were rating, and even if their ratings were accurate, were subsequent downgrades made public fast enough?
    What about the relationship the agencies have with company management, representatives of the same businesses or products they are engaged to rate?
    Investors, governments, broker dealers, investment banks, and others all rely upon credit rating agencies to more precisely understand credit risk. They have to do a first-rate job, Mr. Chairman. However, in some instances, they are the problem, or at the very least, part of the problem, and need to become part of the solution.
    I recently joined Representative Gary Ackerman, who just spoke to this, and reintroduced legislation that proposes reforms for the industry.
    Under H.R. 1181, credit rating agencies would only be able to give an official rating to asset-backed securities that have been sufficiently tested with a proven track record or where their performance can be reasonably predicted.
    The SEC would have the authority to strip nationally recognized statistical rating organizations of their NRSRO designation if the rating agency fails to comply with provisions set forth in the legislation.
    We need to address this problem as part of our efforts to reform the financial system to ensure financial products are adequately examined and restore investor confidence.
    I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," The gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, is recognized for 2 minutes.
"
Mr. Royce," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    You know, the extent to which our entire financial system was and continues to be dependent upon the grades issued by NRSROs is really remarkable. Rating agency grades are incorporated into hundreds of rules, laws, and private contracts, and that affects banking, insurance, mutual funds, and it affects pension funds.
    By making the agencies' opinions count toward determining whether banks had an adequate amount of capital in essence gave their opinions a quasi-official status, basically, from the government.
    And considering how badly the rating agencies misjudged the risks in recent months, the quasi-official treatment of their opinions should be reevaluated.
    The Federal Government's over-reliance on the rating agencies compounds the market-wide perception that these ratings are in some way more than just opinions, and are, in fact, the best indicators of risk.
    This signal to the market lessens the perceived need for counter-party due diligence that a well-functioning market requires.
    Both our over-reliance on the major rating agencies and the poor performance of these entities during the recent market downturn has led me to believe that major reforms to the industry are needed.
    I believe Congress should focus on encouraging alternative tools to assess potential gains or losses, which would enable consumers and institutions to better comprehend investment risk.
    Further, Federal regulators should reevaluate their dependence on these ratings before the Federal Government is asked, once again, to dedicate another $13 trillion due to the economic consequences of this lack of foresight.
    And Mr. Chairman, again, I thank you for this important hearing, and I yield back the balance of my time.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Royce.
    Mr. Capuano, for 3 minutes.
"
Mr. Capuano," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Chairman, first of all, thank you for having this hearing, and I'm looking forward to both this testimony and actually moving some legislation further in the year.
    I haven't been able to go through all the testimony here before me, but I know there has been a lot of talk by some that somehow the freedom of speech amendment allows people to say and do anything they want, and I would respectfully disagree.
    I consider myself a major defender of the First Amendment, and I would do whatever I can to maintain the freedom of speech. However, I don't think freedom of speech applies when you are getting paid. When you are getting paid, you should be held to a higher standard. And if you want freedom of speech, stop getting paid, write an op-ed in the paper, not a problem. Say whatever you want. People can listen to you, or not listen to you. That's all well and good.
    But when your words can and do, number one, ask people to rely on you and, number two, move markets, I do think you should be held to--I think it's unequivocal that you should be held to a certain standard. What that standard is, I think that's fair.
    I don't think it's fair to say that people can't be wrong. Everybody can and is wrong, on a regular basis, and it is a hard thing to distinguish between what is simply an appropriate and fair and reasonable error of judgment versus some other action that might require some reaction.
    So anyway, I'm looking forward to this hearing, Mr. Chairman. I thank you very much for doing this, and I actually look forward to being able to improve the market for investors and to make it so that people can actually rely on the opinions of the credit rating agencies.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Capuano.
    The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, is recognized for 2 minutes.
"
Mr. Hensarling," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    We know there are a number of causes of our Nation's economic turmoil. Most have their genesis in flawed public policy.
    To state the obvious, the three major credit rating agencies missed the national housing bubble. This doesn't necessarily make them duplicitous, doesn't necessarily make them incompetent, but it does make them wrong--very, very wrong.
    Unfortunately, many investors, due to legal imperatives or practical necessity, relied exclusively on ratings from the three largest CRAs, without performing their own conservative due diligence.
    We now know that the NRSRO term has been embedded in our law, approximately 10 Federal statues, approximately 100 Federal regulations, roughly 200 State laws, and around 50 State rules.
    I believe the failure of the credit rating agencies would not have generated the disastrous consequences that it did had the failure not been compounded by further misguided government policies which effectively allowed the credit rating agencies to operate as a cartel.
    By adopting the NRSRO system, the SEC has established an insurmountable barrier to entry into the rating business, eliminating market competition among the rating agencies. People assumed, wrongly, that the government stamp of approval meant accurate ratings.
    Now, we took a step in the right direction with the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006, but it was too little, too late.
    There's a vitally important lesson we must all learn regarding implied government backing. We have seen the results from the government stamp of approval on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. We now see the results, the impact of denying a competitive market for credit rating agencies.
    We must certainly consider this in a development of a potential systemic risk regulator designating specific institutions as too-big-to-fail, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy.
    Outcomes in the market cannot and should not be guaranteed by the government. It causes people to become reliant, dependent, and engage in riskier behavior than they otherwise would.
    When people believe that the government will perform their due diligence for them on the front end, or will bail them out on the tail end, this is very dangerous for the investor, and disastrous for the Nation.
    I yield back the balance of my time.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 2 minutes.
"
Mr. Scott," Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    This is a very important and timely hearing.
    As we continue to monitor the current economic climate we're in, and look towards solutions and improvements that can be made, I believe that this hearing is very, very timely, as the credit rating agencies did in fact play a considerable role in what has transpired, what will also impact, what transpires in the near future.
    Once our financial institutions achieve the desired quality grade on a product, it pays the agency for the rating. This process, as some claim, is rife with conflict, as they believe the agencies are acting as the market regulators, the investment bankers, and as a sales force, all the while claiming to be providing independent opinions. That's it, the problem in a nutshell.
    As these organizations are extremely important to the financial world, we should realize they did have a role to play in where we are now, but I also want to more intently focus on finding some consensus on how to move forward.
    These organizations determine corporate and government lending risk, and are an integral part of our financial services sector, and as such, I want to ensure we take all issues into account, including conflicts of interest, as well as the international finance world, in reforming just how we rate financial products.
    More examination of these agencies is indeed in order, to evaluate the need for improvement, as many have complained that the rating agencies did not adequately assess the risky nature of mortgage-backed securities.
    The credit rating agencies have grown more powerful over the years, maybe more powerful than anyone had really intended.
    However, I do look forward to the witnesses' testimony and how their review of and opinions on this subject will shape the committee's further review of this issue.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr, Scott.
    We will now hear from the gentlewoman from Kansas, Ms. Jenkins.
    Ms. Jenkins. Thank you for holding this hearing today, Mr. Chairman.
    I am by no means an expert on the topic of credit rating agencies, so I'm certainly glad that we have this opportunity to learn more about this issue.
    The credit rating agencies' role in the economy is a straightforward one. They are to provide independent analysis of the quality of various financial assets.
    These agencies, led by Standard and Poor's and Moody's, for quite some time have been relied on by the capital markets to provide independent, meaningful analysis. Investors relied on the supposedly independent ratings, giving these agencies, for investment decisions, where a AAA rating had become the stamp of approval inferring that the investment was a safe one.
    Over time, the original business model, where agencies were paid by the investors, was replaced with a model where the agencies were paid by the issuers themselves. Some would say this led to an inherent conflict of interest that led to the financial collapse that we have been witness to.
    Others have said that, over time, the agencies became little more than a mirror of the market's assessment of risk of a particular bond, providing minimal additional value.
    The question can also be asked whether ratings replaced investor due diligence.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back the remainder of my time.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much.
    And now we will hear from the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, for 2 minutes.
"
Mr. Sherman," Thank you.
    Most entities will eventually work in their own interest. Patriotic speeches and appeals to patriotism only go so far.
    This is an industry that gave AAA to Alt-A, and is as responsible for where we are now as anyone else playing on Wall Street.
    Two things create this self-interest. The industry is picked by the issuer, and believes it cannot be sued by the investor. One of those two needs to change.
    Now, the public accounting forms are picked by the issuer, but they're subject to lawsuits. The auditing firm that audited WorldCom doesn't exist anymore. And in the old days, they were general partnerships, so 100 percent of all the partners' personal equity would be gone. That provided even more incentive to provide for a good audit.
    If we're not going to force the firms to renounce any First Amendment arguments as a condition for doing business on Wall Street, then we need to end the system where they're picked by the issuer. Otherwise, there will be a race to satisfy the issuer by providing the highest ratings to the issuer and we'll get AAA on Alt-A. It won't be mortgages next time, it'll be some other kind of bond. And we'll be back here in another economic crisis.
    We don't allow the pitchers to pick the umpires. If we did, the strike zone would go from the ground to well above the head. We cannot allow the issuers to pick the bond-rating agencies or the credit rating agencies unless we're going to then bring in trial lawyers with instant replay cameras. That would assure that the umpires wouldn't cater to the pitchers, if they were subject to lawsuits and instant replay. But one of those two things needs to change, or the fear of God will prevent us from being in this situation with mortgages for a few years, but we'll be back here in another semi-depression with some other kind of credit instrument.
    I yield back.

Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Sherman.
    I will now introduce the panel, and I want to thank you all for appearing before this subcommittee today.
    Without objection, your written statements will be made a part of the record. You will each be recognized for a 5-minute summary of your testimony.
    First, we have Mr. Robert Auwaerter, principal and head of the Fixed Income Group, Vanguard.
"
Mr. Auwaerter,"  STATEMENT OF ROBERT F. AUWAERTER, PRINCIPAL AND HEAD OF THE 
             FIXED INCOME GROUP, THE VANGUARD GROUP
"
Mr. Auwaerter," Mr. Chairman, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for the opportunity to testify at this important hearing.
    I am the head of the Fixed Income Group at Vanguard, which is the world's largest mutual fund company.
    Credit ratings provide a useful purpose in the financial markets for the small investor. They act as a way to provide a standardized way for investors to do an initial screen of potential investment choices. For institutional investors, they provide instructions to their managers on how to limit risk.
    They also serve a constructive purpose in government regulations, the most prominent being SEC Rule 2-A(7) governing money market funds.
    Their NRSRO ratings protect investors by limiting the funds' ability to chase higher yields through riskier securities based on the funds' own subjective assessment. While NRSRO ratings serve as an objective and necessary qualification for buying a security, on their own, they are not sufficient to warrant an investment.
    Importantly, credit ratings are a starting point. Investors must do their own analysis when determining the appropriateness of an investment.
    Investors choose Vanguard to invest on their behalf in part because of our ability to employ significant resources toward assessing credit risk in our bond portfolios. In total, Vanguard has 25 senior credit analysts with over 400 years of cumulative industry experience.
    It's important to recognize that in order to avoid the mistakes of the past, 100 percent perfection and accuracy in ratings cannot be the goal. However, we believe there's need for further regulation of credit rating agencies.
    The focus of these efforts should be on improving the transparency and reliability of credit ratings, while at the same time controlling disclosing the conflicts of interest that exist in all credit rating agency business models.
    For example, the ratings process for corporate borrowers must address the need to protect material non-public information from being disseminated.
    Currently, issuer-paid credit rating agencies will take material, non-public information, such as management forecasts, into account in the ratings assessment process.
    We are concerned that proposals which force full disclosure of all credit rating material from corporate issuers, including non-public information, to all potential credit rating agencies will, in the end, end up limiting disclosure to all credit rating agencies. Under this scenario, we would expect credit ratings to become less reliable, not more reliable.
    However, on the other hand, we're in favor of greater and more frequent disclosure by issuers of municipal and structured finance securities. Structured finance, and for that matter, municipal ratings, are impaired by a lack of transparency of key credit rating determinants by the issuer of the security. We would like to see greater transparency and disclosure from the issuers to the investors as a feature of improved regulations.
    Regardless of the business model, the ratings product must be subject to very high standards of independence, diligence, and accountability. For that reason, Vanguard supports an increase in the authority of the SEC to provide appropriate oversight of the NRSROs.
    Improved regulations and oversight should focus on transparency and reliability of the ratings process. The NRSROs should be subject to regular audits that test compliance to internal procedures, the independence of rating actions, and the diligence of the ratings process.
    The goal of these should not be to regulate the actual ratings, but rather, the process by which the rating agencies derive these ratings.
    The NRSRO designations should also be limited to CRAs that are in compliance with strict regulatory requirements. There's opinion out there that by inducing greater competition to the CRA marketplace, rating quality will automatically improve. While competition itself can be constructive, it may come at a significant cost.
    By artificially leveling the playing field, inducing many new participants, the market will be littered with a wide dispersion of credit ratings for issuers in structured finance transactions.
    It's very important in designating a credit rating agency as an NRSRO that the SEC determines there is sufficient analytical and operational resources to perform an appropriate level of independent credit analysis. By definition, NRSROs should have a wide market appeal, and should not be niche rating agencies focusing on narrowly defined segments of the market.
    Importantly, under these new rules, the ability to pull an NRSRO designation would provide a powerful incentive for compliance.
    Regulators should finally consider creation of a standing advisory board comprised of key rating agency constituents. It could serve an important role in providing feedback on new product types, ratings performance, and regulatory proposals to both the credit rating agencies and the appropriate regulators.
    In summary, we think the credit rating agencies serve a useful purpose in the market and in government regulations, and we support an increase in authority of the SEC to provide oversight to ensure that credit rating agencies have the appropriate resources and procedures to deliver a ratings product that meets very high standards of independence, diligence, and accountability.
    Thank you.

    The rating agency legislation passed by Congress in 2006 was an important step forward. It greatly improved the regulatory process by which a rating agency can receive a national designation from the SEC, and it has in fact increased the number of competitors.
    But given the worldwide collapse of the credit markets, and the loss of trillions of dollars by individuals, companies, and governmental entities, it is now clear that Congress needs to take further action addressing the conflicts of interest which have arisen in the context of having rating agencies paid by the corporations whose debt they are evaluating.
    As the Congressional Oversight Panel has stated, the major credit rating agencies played an important and perhaps decisive role in enabling and validating much of the behavior and decisionmaking that now appears to have put the broader financial statements at risk.
    Realpoint uses a different business model than S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. We are an independent, investor-paid business, which means our revenues come from investors, portfolio managers, analysts, broker dealers, and other market participants who typically buy a subscription to our services.
    We produce in-depth monthly rating reports on all current commercial mortgage-backed securities. Moody's, S&P, and Fitch, on the other hand, are paid by the issuers of the securities. They are paid substantial upfront fees on a pre-sale basis by the corporations selling securities or investment banks which are underwriting the sales. The fees can exceed $1 million in a single transaction.
    In a word, the results of the issuer-paid business model have been miserable. The SEC recently published data showing that Moody's has had to downgrade 94.2 percent of all the subprime residential mortgage-backed securities it rated in 2006. This is the equivalent of a major league baseball player striking out 19 out of 20 times at bat. We see a similar trend developing now in the CMBS market.
    In contrast, Realpoint's ratings were lower from the outset, and have proven to be more stable than those of the issuer-paid agencies. Even during these unprecedented times, downgrades at Realpoint are less than 30 percent on all current CMBS transactions, and have generally taken place 6 to 12 months sooner than the corresponding rating actions taken by other rating agencies.
    The core problem with the issuer-paid system, and the most important message I would like to leave with the subcommittee today, is that the integrity of the rating process is undermined by the pervasive practice of rating shopping.
    When an issuer decides to bring a new security to market, it generally begins the process by providing data to the three rating agencies. The three rating agencies are more than willing to provide preliminary levels on ratings, knowing that the issuer will tend to hire the agencies that provide the highest ratings.
    We hear a lot about complexities of modern finance, but the rating process is hardly complex. The solution is equally simple, and it only takes one step. Let all the designated rating companies have the same information and prepare their own pre-sell ratings, regardless of whether or not they are ultimately paid by issuers or by investors.
    In our view, there is simply no better or more straightforward way to enhance the integrity of the ratings process than to share the information with all agencies which the SEC has deemed as worthy of being a nationally recognized agency. In fact, the SEC has already proposed precisely such a rule, through an amendment to its fair disclosure rules.
    The public benefits of taking this simple step are immediate and manifestly obvious.
    Last year, the Federal Reserve began implementing the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, or TALF Program. Initially, the ratings component of TALF was limited to Moody's, S&P and Fitch.
    We are pleased to learn that the Federal Reserve is now taking steps to increase the number of rating agencies eligible to participate in this program. As a matter of fact, we just learned that Realpoint and DBRS are now part of the TALF program.
    We believe that this will increase competition and lead to more accurate ratings behind the taxpayer guarantees which stand behind these programs.
    TALF and other comparable programs utilize the standard industry practice of requiring two ratings in order for securities to be deemed suitable collateral. There is likewise no valid public policy reason for not insisting that at least one of these ratings be an independent investor-based rating.
    In this manner, the TALF program serves not only as a catalyst for restarting the securitization market, but as a vanguard to reform the credit rating industry.
    A mandate to have TALF and other government assisted programs utilize the ratings of at least one independent rating agency would enhance investor confidence in those programs and set the stage for ultimately resurrecting reliable ratings in the private sector.
    In short, the American taxpayers should not be subject to the same failed rating shopping syndrome I described earlier.
    In conclusion, the integrity of the ratings process is deeply flawed, but this is not a complex problem, and, in fact, it is not that different from when we were all in high school and everyone sought out the teachers who were known as easy graders.
    We simply need to put an end to the rating shopping process that encourages issuer-paid rating agencies to inflate their ratings.
    Thank you very much for your time.

    We will now next hear from Mr. Eugene Volokh, Gary T. Schwartz professor of law at UCLA School of Law.
"
Mr. Volokh,"STATEMENT OF EUGENE VOLOKH, GARY T. SCHWARTZ PROFESSOR OF LAW, 
                       UCLA SCHOOL OF LAW
"
Mr. Volokh," Mr. Chairman, members of the committee, thanks very much for having me here.
    I was asked to provide an objective First Amendment analysis of the free speech issues raised by regulation of, and liability for, the speech of ratings agencies.
    I am a scholar of the First Amendment. I am not a scholar of commercial law. And I will try to stick to what I think the First Amendment law sets forth, without opining on what I think is sound financial policy here.
    So my first point is that the ratings issued by rating agencies are, generally speaking, speech of the sort that is presumptively protected by the First Amendment. They are predictive opinions based on factual investigation, and based on some degree of expertise.
    In that respect, they are quite similar to the work product of investment newsletters, or, for that matter, of the financial pages of well-respected newspapers. Those, too, offer predictive opinions based on factual investigation with some degree of expertise on the part of the author.
    Now, those, too, are for-profit entities, or at least they try to be for-profit entities. This does not strip them of First Amendment protection. The First Amendment protection has long been understood as covering for-profit entities. In fact, otherwise, newspapers, magazines, movie studios, all of them would be constitutionally unprotected.
    To be sure, rating agencies are particularly, or at least were particularly respected, and their speech was found particularly valuable, but the fact that speech is especially valuable generally does not diminish the scope of First Amendment protection that is offered it, and the fact that people rely on that speech, generally speaking, does not diminish the scope of First Amendment protection.
    So, generally speaking, the First Amendment is presumptively in play here. That is not just my view. That is the view of the Federal circuit courts that have considered this issue in the related context of libel lawsuits by the ratees against the rating agencies. The Sixth and the Tenth Circuits have spoken to this very issue, and have said this speech is generally protected by the First Amendment.
    Now, to be sure, not all such speech ends up being protected by the First Amendment. So, for example, if an agency is actually paid to issue a favorable report, not just issue a report, but issue a favorable report, that would probably make it commercial advertising, which is much less protected under the First Amendment, much as if a newspaper were paid to write a favorable article about a company--which I believe is considered quite unethical in newspapers, though I am told that it is not uncommon in fluff entertainment magazines and the like--that would presumably be commercial advertising.
    The fact, though, that there is a payment being made not for the positive review, but a payment being made by a company to the subject of the review, does not make the review commercial advertising. Newspapers routinely take advertising from the very same companies whose products they review, and there is some degree of possible pressure to bias the reviews in this respect. If you want to keep getting advertising from Ford, you may want to write positive reviews of Ford, counteracted by the desire to maintain the value of the newspaper's own brand. But generally, while that risk may lead some papers to be very careful about such practices, those payments do not strip speech of full protection.
    Likewise there are certain situations in which a company may be hired specifically to give personalized advice to an investor, much like an accountant or a lawyer or a psychotherapist or what have you could be hired to give personalized advice to a client. That would presumably fit the speech into the category of professional-client speech, which is much less protected. And that might, in fact, describe what some rating agencies do in certain circumstances. There are some cases in which rating agencies have been found to do just that.
    But, generally speaking, the fact that they are professionals who offer expert commentary does not make them subject to this kind of restriction. So long as they are speaking to the world at large, and they are not addressing their advice to the personalized circumstances of a particular person whom they are counseling, their speech generally remains fully constitutionally protected.
    So such speech would likely be protected categorically to the extent it is treated as a matter of opinion, and would likely be protected under the New York Times v. Sullivan actual malice standard, to the extent that it implies specific, verifiable facts. That means that it wouldn't be judged by a negligence standard, but rather by whether the ratings agencies knew the statements were false or likely to be false. Again, there is lower court case law on that very point.
    So those, I think, are the constraints in direct regulation or litigation against rating agencies.
    However, say that the government chooses to say, we will give some special status to certain agencies on condition that, for example, they don't take money from the companies that they rate, or that they only take money from subscribers, and if they don't want to be subject to those conditions, they are free to express their opinions but they will not get this special government-provided status.
    That kind of restriction on agencies that are given this specialized status as a condition of getting that status would probably be constitutionally permissible.
    Thank you.

Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much.
    We will now hear from Mr. Stephen W. Joynt, president and chief executive officer of Fitch, Incorporated.
"
Mr. Joynt," STATEMENT OF STEPHEN W. JOYNT, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE 
                     OFFICER, FITCH RATINGS
"
Mr. Joynt," Thank you, Chairman Kanjorski, Ranking Member Garrett, and members of the committee.
    I would like to spend just a few minutes summarizing my prepared statement.
    Nearly 2 years has passed since the onset of the credit crisis. What began as stress focused on the global capital markets has evolved into a more severe economic slowdown.
    An array of factors have contributed to this, and these have been broadly analyzed by many market participants, the media, and within the policymaking and regulatory communities.
    During this time, the focus of Fitch Ratings has been on implementing initiatives that enhance the reliability and transparency of our ratings. More specifically, we are vigorously reviewing our analytical approaches and changing ratings to reflect the current risk profile of securities that we rate.
    In parallel, we have been introducing new policies and procedures, and updating existing ones, to reflect the evolving regulatory frameworks within which the credit rating agencies operate globally.
    I have provided details in my written statement, so I would like now to move on to the primary focus of today's hearing: where do we go from here?
    As this committee considers this important topic, we would like to offer some perspective on a number of the important issues.
    Transparency is a recurring theme in these discussions, and at Fitch, we are committed to being as transparent as possible in everything we do. But transparency also touches on issues beyond the strict control of rating agencies.
    All of Fitch's ratings, supporting rationale, and assumptions, and related methodologies, and a good portion of our research, are freely available to the market in real time, by definition, transparent. We do not believe that everyone should agree with all of our opinions, but we are committed to ensuring that the market has the opportunity to discuss them.
    Some market participants have noted that limits on the amount of information that is disclosed to the market by issuers and underwriters has made the market over-reliant on rating agencies, particularly for analysis and evaluation of structured securities.
    The argument follows that the market would benefit if additional information on structured securities were more broadly and readily available to investors, thereby enabling them to have access to the same information that mandated rating agencies have, in developing and maintaining our rating opinions.
    Fitch fully supports the concept of greater disclosure of such information. We also believe that responsibility for disclosing such information should rest fully with the issuers and the underwriters, and not just with the rating agencies. Quite simply, it's their information and their deals, so they should disclose that information.
    A related benefit of additional issuer disclosure is that it addresses the issue of rating shopping. Greater disclosure would enable non-mandated NRSROs to issue ratings on structured securities if they so choose, thus providing the market with greater variety of opinion, and an important check on perceived ratings inflation.
    The disclosure of additional information, however, is of questionable value of the accuracy and reliability of the information is suspect. That goes to the issue of due diligence.
    While rating agencies have taken a number of steps to increase our assessments of the quality of the information we are provided in assigning ratings, including adopting policies that we will not rate issues if we deem the quality of the information to be insufficient, due diligence is a specific and defined legal concept. The burden of due diligence belongs with issuers and underwriters.
    Congress ought not to hold rating agencies responsible for such due diligence, or requiring it from others. Rather, Congress should mandate that the SEC enact rules to require issuers and underwriters to perform such due diligence, make public the findings, and enforce the rules they enact.
    In terms of regulation more broadly, Fitch supports fair and balanced oversight and registration of credit rating agencies and believes the market will benefit from globally consistent rules for credit rating agencies that foster transparency, disclosure of ratings, and methodologies, and management of conflicts of interest.
    We also believe that all oversight requirements should be applied consistently and equally to all NRSROs.
    One theme in the discussion of additional regulation is the desire to impose some more accountability on rating agencies. Ultimately, the market imposes accountability for the reliability and performance of our ratings and research. That is, if the market no longer has sufficient confidence in the quality of our work, the value of Fitch's franchise will be diminished and our ability to continue to compete in the market will be impeded.
    While we understand and agree with the notion that we should be accountable for what we do, we disagree with the idea that the imposition of greater liability will achieve that. Some of the discussion on liability is based on misperceptions, and while those points are covered in my written statement, it's worth highlighting that the view that the rating agencies have no liability today is unfounded.
    Rating agencies, just like accountants, officers, directors, and securities analysts may be held liable for securities fraud, to the extent a rating agency intentionally or recklessly made a material misstatement or omission in connection with the purchase or sale of a security.
    Beyond the standard of existing securities law that applies to all, fundamentally, we struggle with the notion of what it is that we should be held liable for. Specifically, a credit rating is an opinion about future events, the likelihood of an issue or issuer that they will meet their credit obligations as they come due.
    Imposing a specific liability standard for failing to accurately predict the future, that in every case strikes us as an unwise approach.
    Congress also should consider the practical consequences of imposing additional liability. Expanded competition may be inhibited for smaller rating agencies by withdrawing from the NRO system to avoid specialized liability. All rating agencies may be motivated to provide low security ratings just to mitigate liability.
    In closing, Fitch has been and will continue to be constructively engaged with policymakers and regulators, as they and you consider ideas and questions about the oversight of credit rating agencies. We remain committed to enhancing the reliability and transparency of our ratings, and welcome all worthwhile ideas that aim to help us achieve that.
    Thank you.

Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Joynt.
    We will now hear from Mr. Alex Pollock, resident fellow, American Enterprise Institute.
    Mr Pollock.
    STATEMENT OF ALEX J. POLLOCK, RESIDENT FELLOW, AMERICAN 
                      ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE
"
Mr. Pollock," Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Garrett, and members of the subcommittee.
    As many of the members said in their opening statements, in the housing and mortgage bubble of our 21st Century, the government-sponsored credit rating agency cartel turned out to be a notable weakness. The regulatory NRSRO system made the dominant rating agencies into a concentrated point of possible failure, which then failed.
    Considering this history, Deven Sharma, the president of S&P, has rightly said that we need to, in his words, ``avoid inadvertently encouraging investors to depend excessively on ratings.''
    Let me add, we certainly need to avoid intentionally encouraging investors to depend excessively on ratings, and to treat them as one of many inputs.
    As Congress made clear in the 2006 Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, greater competition in the credit rating agency sector was a key objective, and indeed, this is the right strategy.
    At the beginning of 2005, I published an essay entitled, ``End the Government-Sponsored Cartel in Credit Ratings,'' and that still summarizes my view.
    I do think there has been significant progress in the right direction by the SEC since the 2006 Act, for example, registering Realpoint as an NRSRO, but we can go further.
    In the ideal case, as Congressman Bachus said, we would get rid of all statutory and regulatory references to ``NRSROs.'' I don't know if that is doable.
    I would also strongly support his suggestion of replacing the meaning of ``R'' as ``recognized'' with ``registered,'' so that we had only nationally registered rating agencies. That would be a step in the right direction.
    As I remember, we talked about that in 2005-2006, maybe even had it in bills at one point, but it didn't make it into the final Act.
    Now, what everybody in financial markets wants to know is the one thing that nobody can know, namely, the future. So Wall Street continually invents ways to make people confident enough to buy securities, in spite of the fact that they can't know the future. These assurances, as has been said, are, of course, opinions, and the credit rating agency ratings are an extremely important form of such opinions.
    In the course of financial events, some such opinions will inevitably prove to be mistaken, some disastrously mistaken, as has been evident in the 21 months since the beginning of the financial panic in August 2007.
    We would all like to have infallible knowledge of the future. Can't we somehow ``assure'' credit ratings which are ``accurate,'' to borrow terms from a current bill in the Senate? Can't we guarantee having models which are right?
    And the answer is, no. No rating agency, no regulatory agency, no modeler with however many computers, can make universally correct predictions of future events.
    The worst case would be to turn the SEC, through the regulation of ratings process, which could easily turn into regulating ratings, into a monopoly rater, which would also suffer from the same lack of ability to predict the future. So would any--to touch on a separate topic--so-called systemic risk regulator, should we make what I believe to be the mistake of creating one.
    But having more credit rating competitors, especially those paid by investors, in my view, increases the chances that new insights into credit risks and how to conceptualize, analyze, predict, and measure them, will be discovered.
    It will also reduce the economic rents to the present dominant rating agencies, and should we create this increased competition, we should expect and welcome greater dispersion of ratings. That will tell us we're getting different points of view, and whether ratings are concentrated around a mean or dispersed would be very important information for investors.
    A particularly desirable form of increased competition, as others have said, is from rating agencies paid by investors, which do have a superior alignment of incentives. A frequent objection to competition in credit ratings is that there would be a so-called race to the bottom, but this does not apply at all to the logic of investor-paid ratings.
    In my view, all regulatory bodies, not just the SEC, all regulatory bodies whose ratings supported over-reliance on the government-sponsored ratings cartel should develop and implement ways to promote the pro-competitive objective of the 2006 Act, and all regulatory rules concerning rating agencies from all regulators, not just the SEC, should be consistent with encouraging competition from the investor-paid model.
    I have previously proposed that a group of major institutional investors, maybe Vanguard, should set up their own rating agency, capitalized and paid for by these investors, working from their point of view. It continues to seem to me likely the market would demonstrate a preference for the ratings of such an agency, and a successful competitor would find ways to distinguish itself by creating more valuable ratings, perhaps, as suggested by our colleague, Rob, in his testimony, by superior ongoing surveillance.
    In sum, Mr. Chairman, competition in the rating agency sector has made some progress since the 2006 Act, and greater competition remains, in my opinion, not only an essential, but also an achievable objective.
    Thanks again for the opportunity to be here.

    I now recognize the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter, to introduce our final witness.
"
Mr. Perlmutter," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    It gives me great pleasure to introduce my friend, Greg Smith, who is general counsel of the Colorado Public Employees' Retirement Association, of which I was a member.
    Greg is the co-chairman of the Council of Institutional Investors. He is also the chair of the subcommittee which deals with the credit rating agencies. He has a background in business and commercial matters, having represented pension plans, as well as a variety of business interests over the years.
    He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from the University of Colorado, and a law degree from the University of Denver.
    And we look forward to his testimony.
    Thank you.STATEMENT OF GREGORY W. SMITH, GENERAL COUNSEL, COLORADO PUBLIC 
               EMPLOYEES' RETIREMENT ASSOCIATION
"
Mr. Smith," Thank you very much. Thank you, Chairman Kanjorski, Ranking Member Garrett, Congressman Perlmutter. I appreciate the kind words.
    I am here to speak on behalf of the Colorado Public Employees' Retirement Association, a pension fund with more than $29 billion in assets, which is responsible for the retirement security of over 430,000 plan members and beneficiaries.
    I greatly appreciate the opportunity to be heard and talk about what I believe is the right direction for credit rating agency reform. My brief remarks will include an overview of how Colorado PERA uses credit ratings, a suggestion on how the Securities and Exchange Commission can provide better oversight of the ratings industry, and views on the need to strengthen NRSROs' accountability for their ratings.
    Credit ratings are an important and sometimes mandated tool for many market participants, including pension funds. Most institutional investors do not rely exclusively on ratings. This holds true for Colorado PERA, as well as most of our peers. Ratings are a part of the mosaic of information that we consider during the investment process.
    Initially, we define our risk tolerance and we determine what percent of allocation is necessary to stay within that range. Ratings serve as a first cut to identify securities for further consideration and analysis. Without such a tool, we and many other investors would have no initial way to screen the tens of thousands of new instruments available for investments each year.
    Because of their significance in the capital market, and their status as financial gatekeepers, we believe NRSROs must be held to a high standard of quality, transparency, and independence. Congress and the SEC must work to strengthen and extend oversight in several areas, ranging from disclosure to policies to methodologies.
    My written testimony provides more detail, but I would like to highlight a few suggestions for action here.
    Like many institutional investors, we encourage the SEC to expand its proposal regarding the delayed disclosure of credit rating actions and credit rating histories, to include all outstanding credit ratings, regardless of whether or from whom the NRSRO received its compensation.
    Similar to the provisions governing auditors, NRSROs should be required to disclose business relationships and should be prohibited from providing ancillary services. They should also publicly disclose fee schedules and the amount of compensation received for individual ratings and from individual clients.
    A mandatory 1-year waiting period should be in place for any NRSRO employee seeking a position with a client. And the SEC should strengthen the current responsibilities and requirements pertaining to NRSRO compliance officers. That's their internal compliance officers.
    At a bare minimum, more detailed information regarding NRSROs' rating methodologies should be made available publicly and in a user-friendly model.
    Providing the SEC with the additional authority and resources, however, will not itself create an adequate system of checks and balances. The market must have a path of recourse. Where these financial gatekeepers fail to adhere to the reasonable industry standards, they should be held accountable for those failures.
    Expressions of concern regarding the business viability of NRSROs in the event a private right of action were recognized by legislation are premised on the contention that NRSROs would become guarantors of the performance of the instruments that they rate, or would somehow become liable in the event a particular rating has changed and the value of the instrument is negatively impacted.
    While this premise serves the interests of those desiring to maintain a lack of accountability, the reality is that no market participant is seeking that form of accountability.
    Rather, we are seeking to have these officially sanctioned gatekeepers held to a reasonable industry standard for the process and methodology that is employed, including the adequacy of the diligence and the unbiased nature of the conclusions.
    The threat presented to NRSROs by a private right of action is in essence no different than that presented to other participants in the marketplace, including institutional fiduciaries like my organization.
    We, like others, are responsible for the process we adhere to. Our honesty and our lack of conflicts of appearances of conflicts of interest in the discharge of our responsibilities is imperative to our success.
    We protect our organization from liability by creating a robust process and strictly monitoring our adherence thereto. We see no legitimate barriers to such a risk management approach by the NRSROs.
    Thank you for the opportunity to be here. I look forward to your questions.
    [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith can be found on page 89 of the appendix.]
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Smith.
    Let me start off with my first question to you.
    When you buy a security, how deeply do you look into the security? Do you do due diligence to see how the security was supported, what the pool was made up of, and who the participants are in the mortgages?
"
Mr. Smith," Absolutely. We look--we drill as far as we can drill. We look at who the issuers are, obviously, what their creditworthiness is--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Issuers being the underwriters, or the individuals who have mortgages?
"
Mr. Smith," Well, it depends on what kind of instrument we're talking about, but if we're talking about mortgage-backed securities--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Mortgage-backed securities.
"
Mr. Smith," --mortgage-backed securities, we would attempt to go back to where the mortgages are, but that's a difficult thing for us to do. There's--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Well, if you cannot do that, then where do you get the information on whether or not you should buy that type of security, except that it is rated AAA?
"
Mr. Smith," What we do as a large institution is, we go out and buy the research from the very people who are issuing the ratings, so we try and drill into it by buying that research from the rating agencies themselves.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," So they not only rate the security, they get paid to sell you the materials they use to rate the particular security?
"
Mr. Smith," There are certainly research relationships where we purchase research from the very institutions that issue ratings, yes, sir.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Very good.
    Mr. Fitch, how many people does your organization employ? I am sorry. Mr. Joynt. That is a Freudian slip, sir.
"
Mr. Joynt," I think our present employee count globally is about 1,900.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," 1,900. And you are one of the three largest in the world; is that correct?
"
Mr. Joynt," Yes.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," And how many employees would you have had, say, in 2002?
"
Mr. Joynt," 2002. I would be guessing. We had--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," About the same amount?
"
Mr. Joynt," No. It would have been much less. Fitch grew by both growing on its own and merging with other, smaller rating agencies, so we made some acquisitions of Bank Watch Rating Agency, Duff and Phelps Rating Agency, GIBCA. So it's very hard to answer the question. But I would say we may have been half that size in 2002.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Half that size. Okay.
    How many of those people are involved as analysts in mortgage-backed securities?
"
Mr. Joynt," In mortgage-backed securities, I can get you that answer. I don't have that answer off the top of my head, globally how many--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Would you be much different than one of the other three major rating agencies that showed a profit, or an income in 2002 of $3 billion and then in 2006, $6 billion? Had your revenue changed as much as that over that 3- to 4-year period?
"
Mr. Joynt," Well, our revenues have grown both through combining with these other rating agencies and growth on our own. The size of our company is much--is smaller than the other rating agencies. Our revenue base would be less than $1 billion.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," $1 billion?
"
Mr. Joynt," Less than that, $600 million or $700 million. That would be at its peak. So we're smaller than the other two.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Now, in your testimony, it seemed to say that you are really only giving an opinion here, and you should not be held for doing the due diligence that would support that opinion. Is that correct, substantially?
"
Mr. Joynt," In the technical way, or legal way that due diligence is described, yes, that's correct. We do a lot of thoughtful research and analysis.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Do you do a professional analysis and present a professional study? I think I saw in your written testimony that it is non-professional. Is that correct?
"
Mr. Joynt," I'm not sure I know the--I believe that we're highly educated and do thoughtful analysis. How you would describe professional, I think we act very professionally. If that's a legal sort of characterization, I'm not sure.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Okay. Well, do you think it is the responsibility of a rating agency to practice due diligence?
"
Mr. Joynt," No.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," It is not?
"
Mr. Joynt," No.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Categorically not. So what would--
"
Mr. Joynt," Due diligence, the way I understand it--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Under law.
"
Mr. Joynt," --as a legal term, yes. I'm not a lawyer, so--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Right. Well, what would you say, just off the cuff, not based on studies, that if the first payment of a mortgage was not made, and if there were no records or support documents of income level, what likelihood would that reflect on the likelihood of default or failure of that type of a mortgage?
"
Mr. Joynt," I would think that would be pretty poor.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," That would be a poor operation?
"
Mr. Joynt," I would think so.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Would you be surprised that a 1998 study of major insurance companies showed that mortgage securities that were AAA rated by the three major agencies, not all rating, but in various amounts, that only 3 percent had a failure as a result of defaulting on payments, particularly the first payment. Moreover, in 2000, only 4 percent failed that defaulted on the first payment. But in 2007, 15.6 percent of the mortgage holders failed to make the first payment on the mortgage. Would you find that remarkable, if those figures came to your attention?
"
Mr. Joynt," Yes. Similar to--I'm not an expert, of course, on mortgage finance, but having said that, I think we all recognize that the origination of riskier and lower quality mortgages accelerated during the period of the mid-2005, 2006, and 2007. I think we all now see that more clearly.
    We also have gone back and studied mortgages and securities that we have rated, and feel like there was a significant incidence of poor origination and maybe significant fraud in the origination.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," My time has run out. I just want to get this last question in, if I may.
    Assuming those facts that I have related to you are correct, what system would you recommend so that kind of information could be made available and brought to the attention of Mr. Smith and his pension fund when he is making a purchase of securities?
"
Mr. Joynt," Very clearly, we have stated that we think all the disclosure that can be made by anybody in the market that helps educate all investors, and not just rating agencies, but all investors, should be supported.
    So I would be in support--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Well, who is the agent or the person who should be responsible to make that report? Not you, because you are not responsible for due diligence.
"
Mr. Joynt," I would think the issuer of the securities and/or their underwriter should be presenting the information that supports the--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," And nobody is to check the authenticity or what material has been presented to anyone? In other words, liars get to keep their lies and get to benefit from their lies; is that correct? We have no checks and balances in our system?
"
Mr. Joynt," No, I would not suggest that. So there are checks and balances--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," What is a check and balance? If I'm the guy who is issuing the pool, and 15 percent of the mortgages in my pool have failed to pay the first payment on their mortgage, who is supposed to tell Mr. Smith about that problem?
"
Mr. Joynt," There should be some kind of check in the system, some kind of expert--
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Well, knowing the system, is there?
"
Mr. Joynt," --that can underwrite or re-underwrite those securities, those individual loans.
    It has not been our expertise. We have not developed expertise to underwrite individual loans in these securities.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," So it is not my fault, it is Mr. Garrett's fault, is that what you are saying?
    Mr. Garrett, you are recognized for--
"
Mr. Garrett," I missed that point. What was my fault?
"
Chairman Kanjorski," I just blamed it on you.
"
Mr. Garrett," I know. I was blamed in the last election for a lot.
    I thank the panel for your testimony.
    Mr. Pollock, in your testimony, you said an astounding thing. You said we would all like to have infallible knowledge of the future, so we can somehow assure credit ratings are accurate. Can't we guarantee having models that are right?
    Well, apparently, you haven't been coming to these hearings, because we already are coming up with a model. It's called a systemic risk regulator, and that individual or individuals is going to be able to do what the credit rating agencies and investors and everybody else have not been able to do, and that is predict the future for all these.
    Any comment?
"
Mr. Pollock," I think your point is absolutely right, Congressman.
"
Mr. Garrett," Mr. Pollock or somebody else mentioned this earlier. As far as the regulator right now, and we had a discussion earlier today on this matter with regard to who regulates the rating agencies, the SEC, and that they're out there doing the audits and what have you.
    Does anyone on the panel have any comments on the SEC? And my opening comments was, I wish we would have them here, maybe in a future hearing have them here, as them being the arbiter or the regulator of the industry?
    You can say something nice about the SEC, if you're worried.
"
Mr. Auwaerter," I think with the SEC, they are the proper regulator. I question whether they have the resources to do it right now, to go out to the agencies and determine that the processes are working right.
"
Mr. Garrett," Mr. Smith?
"
Mr. Smith," I think also that in the 1996 Act, or I'm sorry, the 2006 Act, there were some restrictions put on the SEC that I think they're committed to doing a better job of regulating credit rating agencies if they're given the full range of powers to do so.
"
Mr. Garrett," And I'll just throw out the one idea. Is there anyone else out there--I mean, banks have to deal with credit issues all the time, so should we switch this over to bank creditors, the banking regulators, to look at this? Does anybody suggest that?
    Mr. Pollock?
"
Mr. Pollock," I just have a comment, if I may, on the banking regulators.
    Of course, what has happened historically is, increasingly, the banking regulators have outsourced the credit judgment to the credit rating agencies, notably, as I think someone mentioned in an opening statement, through the so-called Basel II capital requirements, which not only outsourced the credit decision but also the capital requirement decision to the ratings.
    I think you have to say on behalf of the rating agencies, a lot of them commented that was a bad idea, and it was a bad idea.
"
Mr. Garrett," Just very quickly, and then I'll go to Mr. Dobilas on this--if I'm pronouncing it correctly--Mr. Pollock, since we can't get an all-seeing, all-knowing person out there, and my question for the panel if we have enough time will be, what do we really need, what does the--and sir, this is along your line of questioning--what do the agencies really need to be looking at in order to make these proper determinations?
    First--saying even if we do away with regulations, it really comes down to whether you have someone out there, whether they are a regulator or not a regulator, coming up with a methodology to try to do the best they possibly can to predict the future, and then my question following that, Mr. Dobilas, will be, how come, according to your testimony, you said that--you alluded to the fact that even in the midst of this, Realpoint has been able to issue accurate credit downgrades 6 to 12 months sooner than your largest competitors. How were you able to evaluate it better?
"
Mr. Pollock," One important point is who is making a decision to hire the credit rating agency. An investor-paid rating agency has to convince investors that its ratings are worthwhile buying.
"
Mr. Garrett," Okay.
"
Mr. Pollock," That's a really good check and balance, right there.
"
Mr. Garrett," I'm sure the credit rating agency would say that there's a separate--there's a Chinese wall through on that.
"
Mr. Dobilas," I guess Alex is stealing some of my thunder here, but I think you have to understand the basic difference between subscriber and issuer paid.
    We are paid by investors, and they have cancellation rights. We actually are very proactive in our methods with regards to surveillance and transparency.
    Issuer-paid agencies today make a lot of their money upfront when a deal is initially hired.
    Subscriber-paid agencies have more of a focus on the surveillance process, on an ongoing basis, meaning we review every CMBS transaction, every single month, and have a detailed review. What we try to do is be fully transparent to investors.
"
Mr. Garrett," And you would suggest, and you don't work there, that the Big Three don't have the same modeling; is that, in essence?
"
Mr. Dobilas," They do not have the same basic philosophy when it comes to surveillance. Their major emphasis has always been on the pre-issue, the new issue marketplace. That's where they make most of their money.
    The surveillance model wouldn't be in existence today if the rating agencies were doing a good job on the surveillance side. Monthly surveillance, we listen to investors, investors are our clients.
    I started in the rating agency business about 15 years ago, and I can tell you, there has been really no major changes with regards to clarity and transparency to investors until Realpoint came along on the CMBS side. We are offering a different business model to investors, which investors are very supportive of.
    We don't want to tell them what the right answer is, but we want them to understand fully what our analysis is and how we got to that analysis. By underwriting all of the underlying commercial properties, showing them our underwriting, you know, they're seeing something that they have never seen before, and it proves to be a more reliable rating than the reactive ratings of our counterparts.
"
Mr. Garrett," I appreciate that. I need to better get my arms around the differences, but I appreciate the testimony. Thanks.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Garrett.
    We will now hear from Mr. Ackerman.
"
Mr. Ackerman," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Joynt, if I may read from your testimony two lines:
    ``A Fitch rating is our opinion about the future financial capacity of a company or other issuer to pay its debt. It is not a statement of fact or a professional judgment.'' It's your opinion. You're entitled to your opinion.
    There are 300 million Americans. Do you know how many have opinions? I would say about 300 million.
    My cousin, Sheldon, has opinions. He has opinions on everything. He is not a professional, either, and sometimes his statements of fact aren't.
    You get paid sometimes, I understand, $1 million by clients for your opinion, and the reason you get paid so much money for your opinion is because some people think that this is a professional judgment. And you get paid because you are something that is called an NRSRO. My cousin Sheldon isn't.
    My cousin Sheldon can't put AAA on some company that they're going to market. Nobody would pay him 2 cents for his opinion.
    You get paid that much money because you have a government franchise from the SEC. Of the 300 million people, plus I don't know how many entities in America, I understand there are only 10 so designated by the government, and the reason is, then people rely on that, because they think this now has the government's imprimatur to issue very professional statements based on some expertise that you have.
    Now, if these are only your opinions, which you may think are better than Sheldon's, would you be adverse to putting a warning on your ratings, much like on cigarette cartons, that says, ``This rating is not a statement of fact,'' which is what you say, ``nor is it a professional judgment, and it's just as good as my cousin Sheldon's,'' and put that in a box?
"
Mr. Joynt," Not knowing your cousin Sheldon, I wouldn't reference him, but I suppose I would respond this way. We try to be very clear about what the ratings are intended to mean and what they're not intended to mean, so they're not an all-purpose recommendation of anything, they're--
"
Mr. Ackerman," But the point I'm making is there's a difference in Cousin Sheldon's free speech, coming from a guy called Cousin Sheldon, who has no other credentials and isn't 1 of 10 entities or people in America who have been selected by the government to represent themselves as nationally recognized.
    Once you're nationally recognized, and you bear this franchise, given so rarely by the government, you get to charge $700 billion, last year is what I think you said--$700 million, I get carried away--$700 million to people who value the fact that you bear that franchise and Cousin Sheldon doesn't.
    So there's a responsibility there for the exercise of your speech, which is not free, it's $700 million worth of charges. That's different than Cousin Sheldon's free speech.
"
Mr. Joynt," I believe one of the reasons why we receive remuneration for what we do is because, over a period of time, many participants in the capital markets, including large, sophisticated institutional investors, have learned to develop our opinion across a wide range of ratings and research that we do--
"
Mr. Ackerman," People make life-changing decisions based on your rating. It is not something that is casual. If it's something that people rely on, that they think that we have empowered the SEC to license you, in effect, to exercise the world's greatest judgment and tell people what the best judgment in the world can say, shouldn't you bear a responsibility?
    You can't just say, ``I'm not a doctor, but I play one on TV,'' or ``I'm not a professional, but I play one in the marketplace.''
"
Mr. Joynt," I believe we feel quite accountable and responsible for the quality of the work that we do, and we work very hard to make sure that we're educated in what we're doing and undertaking, you know--
"
Mr. Ackerman," I'm sure that Cousin Sheldon feels the same way, but the problem is if that is just your opinion, why don't we just strip away the fact that you have a government license to operate, that you have been franchised as 1 of only 10 entities in the country that's qualified to make that non-professional, non-statement of fact judgment?
"
Mr. Joynt," I know in my--and I have been--I think it's wise for you to think in that way. I believe that NRSROs were designated and ratings were used for constructive purposes, including in each of these regulations at the time they were put in place.
    All I have suggested is people think about changing the regulations or the recognition of rating agencies, that it be thought about over time, carefully, and consistently. There was a constructive reason why they were used, and so rather than just creating a sort of a blanket change, I think it would be more constructive to not throw the baby out with the bathwater, to carefully consider it over time. I think that's exactly what the SEC is doing right now, for many of the regulations that they have.
"
Mr. Ackerman," Mr. Volokh gave us a brilliant treatise on the First Amendment, much of which I subscribe to wholeheartedly.
    Newspapers don't have to have a license. They have a First Amendment right. It's not like if the country decided, and we decided we're going to license newspapers, and only license 10 of them. There would be a big difference in the world, in our interpretation of free speech.
    And newspapers are self-policing. They make their own rules, and put advertisement over something that's an advertisement, not required by any law or rule. It's their own judgment to do so.
    Your industry, the credit rating industry, does not have the sense of integrity that those other purveyors of free speech, the real purveyors of free speech have, and they self-police and say, ``This is an ad.''
    Why don't you just say, ``This is an advertisement, it's AAA. It's my endorsement.''
    You endorse products, is what you do, for a price, like a baseball player endorses sneakers.
"
Mr. Joynt," So, Mr. Ackerman, I might also add that at the recent SEC hearings last month, when confronted with the same question, both Standard and Poor's and Moody's, I believe, responded that they thought it was wise that the rating agencies be taken out of regulation.
    And so I was asked my opinion at that time, because I had a different view, which was I thought that should be thought about carefully. So because I think there are constructive reasons to be designated NRSROs and using ratings, and also I believe that without designating anyone, the present incumbents would be more likely to be used by investors for the good reasons that they're used right now, in referencing ratings, and I think it might inhibit competition and diversity of opinion--
"
Mr. Ackerman," Let me just say, because my time has expired, and the chairman has been very generous, that free speech cannot be charged for. You don't charge anybody for exercising free speech.
    If you want to exercise free speech, you shouldn't have a government license, and if you have a government license, and are only one of a few designated to have that, there's nothing wrong with paying for the license. You pay for a fishing license. And the price you pay, or the price you should pay, is the price of being responsible in the marketplace, to be held accountable by people who feel they might have been misled by your endorsement of a product that should not have been endorsed.
    I yield back the balance--I guess I have no balance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Do not push it, Mr. Ackerman.
    [laughter]
"
Chairman Kanjorski," The Chair now recognizes Mr. Bachus for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Bachus," Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Ackerman, your Cousin Sheldon, what does he do, what line of work is he in?
"
Mr. Ackerman," Last I heard, he was with the Department of Sanitation.
"
Mr. Bachus," All right, then.
    [laughter]
"
Mr. Bachus," That pretty much sums it up.
    I ask the panel, do any of you plan to rely on Congressman Ackerman's Cousin Sheldon for risk assessment? Probably not, right?
    Let me ask you this. Mr. Joynt, first of all, let me say this: I admire you for being here. It's my understanding that S&P and Moody's were not invited, but you were. That sort of leaves you out on the point.
    I want to ask you, just ask you some questions, just to try to understand where we go from here, as you said.
    If the debt issuers don't pay for these risk assessments--I mean, individual investors can't pay for them, so who would pay for them? Is there a practical--and I know people have talked about conflicts of interest. But who would fill that gap if the issuers did not?
"
Mr. Joynt," So, investors now receive--pay for research, but they receive the benefits--all investors, retail investors, institutional--receive the benefit of the public and transparent nature of the rating agencies that come from the issuer-paid ratings.
    I don't believe that there would be enough payment, sponsorship, organization of investor payment for the ratings to support the kind of staffs that we now have in place to do what I think is, you know, quite a deep and educated job in analyzing securities.
    So I believe somehow we would lose the benefit of the positive of what with have now in the form of, at least, Fitch.
"
Mr. Bachus," Yes. And I ask the other panel members, and the law professor--this may be outside your field, but other than the professor--who--you know, we all say there appears to be a conflict when an issuer pays for it, but who else would pay for it? I mean, is there a practical substitute?
"
Mr. Smith," Well, as I said earlier, from the institutional investors' perspective, we buy the research and we get some of the benefit there, but that doesn't solve the issue, and the issue, I think you're getting to is, who is going to pay for the determination by whatever gatekeeper it is, whether or not a particular instrument meets capital requirements, etc., and I don't have a good answer for you.
    I don't think that turning to an investor-pay model instead of an issuer-pay model really fills all of the need that there is for making this determination. There's going to have to be something else that's identified, or else we're going to have to make credit ratings something we can actually rely on.
    I think that can be accomplished. I think it could be accomplished through transparency and accountability, and when there's a price to be paid for not just being wrong in that the instrument didn't perform as it was expected to--I don't expect them to predict the future; I think that's a red herring--what we expect them to do is create a robust process, free of conflicts, free of bias, and carry out that process consistently throughout all the products, and put the product out there for us to buy. And it seems pretty straightforward.
"
Mr. Bachus," Anyone else?
"
Mr. Dobilas," Yes, I would like to comment.
    You know, I would like to make a distinction, too, in saying that I only speak for CMBS.
    You know, when we look at a subscriber-paid model, it works very well in the surveillance arena. Now, on the new issue side though, I have to say there is a real problem with the issuer-paid model. And that really isn't a problem that can't be solved, but it's going to need a long-term approach. It's going to need somebody to set the example and show investors what subscription-paid models can do in that arena, and somebody is going to have to absorb the cost, because when you do look at these new issue deals, there's a very large cost structure involved for a rating agency when they do go in to rate a new issue security.
    On the CMBS side, you have to visit every property, you have to underwrite those properties, you have to travel. You know, somebody is going to have to pick up those expenses.
    But I do think that if investors can see the light at the end of the tunnel, they will wean themselves of, you know, the dependency on those two, you know, new issue ratings, but somebody is going to have to step in in the interim and make sure that the playing field is equal, and investors will eventually buy those analyses.
    Realpoint, we were looking at offering a very cost-effective--
"
Mr. Bachus," Let me thank--I mean, I appreciate that, and I think, really, though, we're saying, I'm not sure how we do that.
"
Mr. Pollock," Congressman, if I could comment on that, the rating agency world I picture is one that has both investor-paid and issuer-paid competitors in it. I don't think there is any chance that the issuer-paid agencies are going to go away. They are going to still be there. There is a large set of free riders in the public who get the ratings, and they'll continue to get the ratings, but there will be competitive pressure for quality from the investor-paid models.
    We should say, of course, the ratings, as I said in my testimony, are very valuable to all sellers of fixed-income securities, because they're a great part of the ability to move those securities, and they'll have an interest in making sure such ratings are available.
"
Mr. Bachus," And I think part of that answer, if you expand, and you don't--you know, these nationally recognized, I think, people have relied on that as somewhat of a guarantee, and we need to expand that number.
    But also, I mean, I would have to say that we also--you know, there have to be some qualifications for registration.
    Can I ask one other question? I know you have gone over with everybody else.
    Mr. Joynt, is the problem--you have mentioned fraud. Obviously, that can be a problem, when they fail to disclose information. But how about expertise, I mean, or competence? I mean, that, on occasion, you know, there probably just wasn't the competence there, because of the complexity. Is that true?
"
Mr. Joynt," So for mortgage-backed securities, I would say the accelerated environment and pace of origination and the change to broker origination, and usage by financial firms, which happened quite quickly in large volumes in that period of 2005 and 2006, I think, contributed a lot to a change in the basic competence of the origination of the mortgage process, and so the need to have checks on that arose quickly. The checks probably weren't in place. The reliance, therefore, on the historical data, of what defaults and delinquencies had occurred in the past compared to what actually was happening or about to happen, especially with the weakest-quality mortgages, would indicate to me that all the competence, up and down the chain, was not there.
"
Mr. Bachus," Let me ask you this. Not you, S&P, you know, Moody's, what is the rate of just saying, ``We decline to rate, we don't have the expertise?''
"
Mr. Joynt," So I think the philosophy of the three largest rating agencies has been to say, ``Let us collect the information. Let's see if we can rate something. We probably can analyze it best and offer some kind of analysis or opinion to investors.''
    So there have been occasions where Fitch, particularly, declined to rate some securitizations, because we were uncomfortable with the structure or the credit enhancement level that we would think was appropriate for the given rating wasn't appropriate. In the case of SIVs, the special investment vehicles, we were uncomfortable rating the junior capital notes.
    And so there have been instances where rating agencies declined to rate, but if there's something that we're uncomfortable about the analysis, we probably would be assigning, in many cases, lower ratings, and less frequently, unable to assign any rating.
"
Mr. Bachus," Okay, thank you.
"
Mr. Joynt," There have been some.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much, Mr. Bachus.
    And now we will hear from Mr. Sherman for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Sherman," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Responding in part to the gentleman from Alabama, I think it's important not who pays the credit rating agency, but who selects the credit rating agency. And I'll give you a baseball analysis on that.
    Imagine a baseball league in which the league pays the umpires, but the home team gets to select anybody they want to be the umpire. That's going to be a home team that's going to win a lot of games.
    In contrast, imagine a baseball league where the home team has to give $100 to the umpire, each umpire, but the league sends out the umpires. Those are going to be umpires who are answerable to the league, whose livelihood depends upon the league thinking they're doing a good job.
    As long as issuers are selecting the credit rating agency, then the way to be successful as a credit rating agency is to make the issuers happy, and then conceal from the public that the way to be successful is to make the issuers happy. It's who selects, not who pays.
    Now, one approach we could have to all this is to try to make the credit rating more reliable. The other, and I think our first witness kind of took this approach--I'm sure I'm over-simplifying--we could just tell everybody how unreliable these credit ratings are, and tell them not to rely upon them, or only as a first step.
    Now, Vanguard has the advantage of hiring, what did you say, 30, 40 different credit analysts. I won't ask you whether it's 30 or 40.
    Investors ought to be allowed to invest directly in debt instruments, without hiring a team of 40 people. They should be able to rely on the credit rating.
    And even--and I have all my money at Vanguard. But when I even--and so I'm relying on your analysts, but not entirely, because I have to compare your funds to other funds that tell me they get better yields. But then I look, and I see which fund invests more safely. Well, how can I determine that?
    I could rely upon your name, although there are some big names on Wall Street that have tanked recently. I don't know which names are good and which aren't. Or, I can rely upon the fact that your bond funds are mostly AA and partially AAA, and somebody else's high-yield fund--as a matter of fact, that's what distinguishes your high-yield fund from the lower-yield funds.
    Professor, you said if somebody gathers information, analyzes it, and expresses their opinion, that would be protected by the First Amendment. I would add, that's what my doctor does, but boy, if he's wrong, I'm going to sue him.
    But more to the point, that's what accountants do and that's what legal opinions do, in offering materials, private placement memorandums, SEC regulations. I think I'm the only CPA up here.
    And what does, when you look in the offering materials, or financial statements, and then there are two paragraphs, usually, written by the auditors. They say, ``In our opinion, the attached financial statements accurately reflect, according to generally accepted accounting principles.''
    So I'll ask you to respond for the record, how the credit rating agency is different from the accounting firm, both in public offerings and in private placement memoranda, but also, you have, if there's a tax advantaged investment, you usually have an opinion letter from a tax counsel, saying, ``Here are what the tax consequences are.''
    I have been the auditor. I have been the tax counsel. And in every case, I knew I would get sued if I was wrong. Otherwise, you would be--well, I would have--my professionalism would have restrained me, but I have colleagues that would have issued just about any kind of opinion.
    What I'll ask you to respond to orally--those other questions are for the rating--is, is there any constitutional bar to us saying, certain credit rating agencies will register with the SEC, and as part of that registration, should they choose to register, they have to waive the right not to be sued for their negligence?
"
Mr. Volokh," Before I answer, could I ask, what is it that they get out of the registration? Is it that they have to be registered in order to--
"
Mr. Sherman," No. Anybody can register, but then the--well, the SEC then says, ``If you want to issue a debt instrument, you must get one of our registered SROs to rate you.'' But, of course, you can go out and hire 12 other people, even--what was the cousin? Sheldon. And you could even get Sheldon, and you could, you know, you got free speech. You can talk all you want about your offering. But you have to pick one from our panel if you want to sell it.
"
Mr. Volokh," Sure. Let me speak in order to both of the matters that you raised.
    The first is the status of professional client speech and to what extent these rating agencies are the equivalent of a doctor or a lawyer or an accountant--
"
Mr. Sherman," Well, in this case they would be registered professional agencies. If you didn't want to be a professional--I see that Fitch is saying it's not a professional judgment--but the SEC would say you can't register unless you want to be a professional.
"
Mr. Volokh," Got it. So if somebody wants to go out there and convey their opinion and have other people pay for the opinion, they are free to do so, but if they want a special government imprimatur that allows an issuer of bonds to include that opinion as part of its issue, they have to comply with certain things.
    I tried to speak to that in some measure in my remarks, and I think that, generally speaking, that would be constitutionally permissible if, going forward, the government were to say, as a condition of getting this particular special government benefit, we demand that you comply with certain kinds of accounting procedures or that you not take any money from the organization that you are rating, or even that you agree to be liable under a negligence standard, then I think as a condition--
"
Mr. Sherman," I have to try to squeeze in one more question. That is, I'm going to propose that the SEC identify which credit rating agencies are qualified. In fact, they have already identified 10, but which are qualified for particular categories of debt instruments.
    And then, every issuer, when they want to take an issue public, of debt, they call the SEC and the SEC assigns one at random, the same way the league assigns a team of umpires.
    Mr. Joynt, this would mean that you would never have to please an issuer. As a matter of fact, if you regard it as a really tough rater, that might be fine, because it would improve your image with the SEC.
    That would change your business model. It would allow perhaps other competitors to emerge, in that having a big name like your company does wouldn't matter as much as being rated as qualified by the SEC.
    Do you see--what disadvantage do you see to someone like myself who would like to invest $10,000 or $20,000 in debt instruments and get a rating that I can rely on?
"
Mr. Joynt," I guess I would come back to try to understand the goal of diversifying that widely among market participants. From our personal interest, of course, we spent a lot of time building up our professionalism and our global reputation. I think we serve investors well as a global rating agency, able to rate a wide variety of things.
    If there was--
"
Mr. Sherman," Well, you would be qualified in all the different categories, or maybe there should just be one or two categories.
"
Mr. Joynt," So then the question turns to what I mentioned earlier, which is on what basis would the SEC or anyone choose among the rating agencies, and if it was just a random sort of rotation, I suppose that would be just adjusting the market shares of as many participants joining the system, is what it would be.
    So there would be--I think many people would try to join. There would be 20, 30, 50 different rating agencies. It would certainly impact the business dynamics of the existing rating agencies, including--
"
Mr. Sherman," But then I would get a rating from an agency that the SEC thought was qualified to do the job. That rating agency would be absolutely unaffected by the desires of the issuer. What's not to like?
"
Mr. Joynt," So, I believe that we're unaffected by the desires of the issuer today, so that the difference between your statement and mine is that--
"
Mr. Sherman," Look, I have never been in your profession, but my doctor seems to care whether I'm pleased as a patient. When I was a lawyer, I wanted to please my clients. When I was a CPA, I wanted to please my clients. I want to please my constituents.
    You're the only--you don't even claim to be a professional, but you claim a level of professionalism so high that you don't care about the business effects to your enterprise of what you do, and in particular, you don't care about whether you please the people who can decide whether to give you the next $1 million contract.
"
Mr. Joynt," But our--
"
Mr. Sherman," So you're claiming a level of professionalism I never aspired to, while disclaiming being a professional.
"
Mr. Joynt," Our credibility comes from building our reputation, not just with issuers, but with investors, regulators, and everyone, over a long period of time, so keeping the proper balance and being independent and doing a thorough job is very important--
"
Mr. Sherman," I could have bought that last year, but now I have seen Alt-A get AAA, and I'm not buying it.
    I'll yield back.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much.
    I will now recognize Mr. Neugebauer for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Smith, have you ever used credit default swaps to insure any of the securities, debt securities that you bought to provide additional protection for the organization that you represent?
"
Mr. Smith," In fact, we have not.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," You have not?
"
Mr. Smith," No.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," And why is that?
"
Mr. Smith," Because we judge them to not be something we wanted to invest our beneficiaries' money in. We did not participate in that field.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," I think in your testimony, Mr. Joynt, that you didn't--you criticized proposals to replace ratings with bond spreads or CDS spreads, because you think the market prices, by definition, are inherently volatile than a fundamentally driven credit rating.
    When you were looking at your ratings and kind of, you had your story and you were sticking to it, were you monitoring the spreads on some of the credit default swaps to say, ``Hmm, there's some risk premiums there that other people think are there, that we're not recognizing.'' I mean, did the bell go off for somebody?
"
Mr. Joynt," Yes. We would take all market inputs, prices, CDS spreads, anything into account when trying to think about the risks that we analyzed. Individual analysts would receive market price information and spreads. Our central credit policy group would monitor CDS prices, and in fact go back to analysts and individual groups and say, ``Have you thought about and seen what's happening with these prices?''
    So I would say we're aware of, it's an important factor, it's an influence, and just to respond to what you originally suggested, we see value in market prices for investors to reflect and think about the risk. I believe those are more volatile than fundamental analysis. They are influenced by market events, volatility, liquidity. And so I think they are complementary.
    So yes, we use them to help think about the fundamental analysis, as well.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," So when those risk premiums started going up, at what point did you start changing? In other words, if I went back and looked at a security that you rated and I started looking at the risk premium in that CDS, when would you have said, ``You know, maybe we don't have this rated right?'' As opposed to--I mean, how much did the premium--well, how much premium increase would I see before I saw a rating change?
"
Mr. Joynt," I can't answer that question specifically, but I should say that there have been times when market spreads have widened out, and contracted back, and it wasn't reflective at all of the fundamental credit risk of a company, and there have been times when market spreads have widened out and subsequently the company's performance has proved to be weaker, ratings were changed subsequently, as well.
    So I mean, there are good examples with the auto companies in the past 10 years, where their credit has weakened and ratings have weakened, and where market spreads have been dramatically different than what the fundamental analysis might have said at the time.
    So it's a wide range, I would say to you.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," I wonder what the difference of the analysis that the people who were taking on those risks for, you know, a relatively small amount of money. You have to be right on those, because they're taking a relatively small premium for a fairly large risk. I mean, so what did they know that you didn't know?
"
Mr. Joynt," I'm not sure how to react to that. There's--whomever was selling or buying protection, there would have been two people thinking two different things about that risk at that price. So one might have been thinking, ``That was a great trade, I'm glad I got this premium,'' and another was thinking, ``I'm glad I shed that risk.''
    So--also, the CDS market is a synthetic and a derivative market. It's not physical securities. So the people who trade or act in that market aren't necessarily--they can act with leverage and volumes that might indicate they have much greater rewards than holding physical securities or risks.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Well, the issuers are taking a real risk. I mean, it's not synthetic, it's real. If there's a default on that security, they have to--there's performance.
"
Mr. Joynt," No, that I understand, but they don't own physical securities.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Some of them do.
    Mr. ``Dobilas''--am I saying that right?
"
Mr. Dobilas," No, but that's okay. It's ``Dobilas.''
"
Mr. Neugebauer," ``Dobilas.'' You would think somebody with a name like Neugebauer could pronounce that, wouldn't you?
    So, in your particular business, you do not do any issue ratings on new issues. When do you start coverage?
"
Mr. Dobilas," Since the NRSRO designation, you know, we are eligible to do new issue, but we would have to fall under the same model, being paid by the issuer, you know, and be sort of a hybrid rating agency.
    Most of our subscription-based business is all--well, actually all of our subscription-based business is paid for by investors.
    We tend to pick up the deal as soon as the information is available to the public. We're not actually privy to the post-sale information that the hired NRSROs have access to.
    So usually, it is 30, about 30 days or after the first payment of the bond that we have access to all the information, enough information to do a detailed analysis on.
    One of our recommendations is definitely to open up that post-sale analysis and allow all NRSROs to have access to that information, so we can, in a timely manner, prepare an analysis that can be available to investors for direct purchase, as opposed to having a reliance, or over-reliance on issuer-paid ratings.
    That way, if, again, an investor felt it necessary to get more information or additional information, it is available to them.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," So one of the--would one of the ideas be that companies before, that are thinking about issuing, whether they have selected your firm or not to rate the issuance, that you be given the same amount--the same information that they're giving to the rating agency that they have selected to do that; so if I'm one of your subscribers, and somebody comes out and says, ``This is a AAA,'' so that's one opinion, and then I call your firm up, and you say, ``No, Randy, we think that's an A?''
"
Mr. Dobilas," Yes, we think more opinions at the post-issuance, you know, level, the better. Let the investors really know what kinds of risks are out there, don't limit it to just two rating agencies.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," But you're not privy to the information that, say, if Fitch has been selected, you do not get the same information up front until after issue; is that what you're saying?
"
Mr. Dobilas," That is what I'm saying. Now that we are a registered NRSRO, though, we can actually join Fitch and, you know, bid on deals in the same pre-sale analysis that they do.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," You can bid on it, but if you don't get the bid, or do you get the information?
"
Mr. Dobilas," No. We're not privy to share that information with our clients at this time. Both Regulation AB and FD sort of prohibit that from happening.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Prior to issue, if you have not been selected?
"
Mr. Dobilas," Correct.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," So you can't issue your opinion on that until after issuance?
"
Mr. Dobilas," About 30 days after issuance, and we can't even use the data if we did take a look during the bidding process. It's a separate group. We can't--
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Is that one of the solutions?
"
Mr. Dobilas," We think the solution is definitely make that information available and disclose it to any registered NRSRO. There's a lot of private information in that data, so you need to regulate that somehow, and we think having a NRSRO designation, you know, would be, again, all the regulation you need to make sure that information stays private, and then allow the rating agencies to analyze that information and prepare their analysis.
    And we think having--again, there's no getting rid of issuer-paid models or no getting rid of subscriber-paid models, and necessarily, I don't think one is better than the other. I think the fact is, having more opinions at that post-issuance is in the best interests of investors.
"
Mr. Neugebauer," Last question, to the panel.
    Under Mr. Sherman's proposal, if somebody else chooses, is there some validity to, if you are all equally competent, that a third party would choose--in other words, you would be in a pool and a third party gets to pick who that is?
"
Mr. Dobilas," I guess if I could just jump in again, you know, the Federal Reserve, it's interesting, because they're faced with that now with regards to the TALF Program.
    And I should also just commend the Federal Reserve, because the level of analysis they did on the rating agencies that participated in TALF was very detailed and analytic and quantitative in nature, a very, very thorough process. But they're faced with sort of a similar distinction now.
    I do not think it's necessarily a bad thing to take that out of the issuer's hands and have a trustee, for instance, be hired to randomly select the rating agencies. The only thing you would want to avoid at all costs is stifling competition and quality, more quality than competition.
    You know, you wouldn't want to see the industry just result in, you know, just, ``Hey, I have a deal coming up in a month, you know, we'll just hang in there and put out a rating.'' You know, you definitely want an evolution of transparency for investors.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you, Mr. Neugebauer.
    We will now have Mr. Capuano for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Capuano," Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Gentlemen, I want to be clear. I have my problems with the way credit agencies work, credit rating agencies work, but I absolutely agree that there is a role for them in the free market world.
    Let me ask you, my problem is trying to figure out a way to get the credit rating agencies to be independent, so that their judgment can be trusted. I can't believe any of you really believe that credit rating agencies' judgments, right now, is trusted by anybody in their right mind. It isn't. And I want to get to a point where it is.
    Let me ask you, what are the consequences when a rating agency gets it wrong?
    Mr. Joynt, I think, I may as well just start with you. And I apologize. I don't mean to pick on you. But--
"
Mr. Joynt," That's all right.
    What's the question?
"
Mr. Capuano," What are the consequences if a rating agency gets it wrong? What are the consequences to your business if you get it wrong?
"
Mr. Joynt," So we put out our rating and our research, and if we get it wrong, it means we would have been changing our opinion quickly, downgrading the rating substantially, and having a surprisingly different rating result or credit result--
"
Mr. Capuano," But do you lose an investment? Does anybody go to jail? Does anybody lose a license? Anything?
"
Mr. Joynt," So investors that would have purchased those securities--
"
Mr. Capuano," I know what they get. What are the consequences to your company if you get it wrong?
"
Mr. Joynt," So they would not be interested in using our services, if we consistently got it wrong.
"
Mr. Capuano," That's fair and reasonable, but that goes to Mr. Pollock's comment, which I thought was very good, of a cartel.
    Now, Mr. Pollock, you would agree that a cartel doesn't necessarily have to be just three or just 10, a cartel could be 100, if they operated as such; is that incorrect?
"
Mr. Pollock," Congressman, it would be really hard to run a 100-member cartel, but I think the key about what happens to the credit rating agency, which is an excellent question, is whether the credit rating agency is judged by the content and value of its ratings, or whether the rating agency is operating by providing a regulatory value, which is what the old system had. Professor Frank Partnoy has discussed this at length, that when you convey a required license, you are conveying the fact that, ``I'm just passing on this regulatory license I have,'' whether your ratings have content or not.
    I'm not saying the ratings don't have content, but that there is a regulatory value which is different from the content value, and the more we could move the market toward what happens to rating agencies being based on the informational, intellectual value of the rating, the better we would do.
"
Mr. Capuano," Content, qualitative analysis, analytical analysis, not opinion, and understanding that, at some point, there's always opinion. I get that.
    If that's the case, I have a proposal, at least when it comes to municipal bonds, to simply require agencies to base their opinion on the ability to repay that debt. And yet, the industry thinks that's some kind of a major problem, and opposes the bill.
    It simply says, ``Base your opinion on the sole factor of whether that city, town, county, or State can repay the debt.'' Where's the problem if that's all we're asking? Simply base your credit rating on that. Where's the problem with that?
    [no response]
"
Mr. Capuano," Good. Nobody has one. So you're all in favor of the bill? Mr. Chairman, I guess we can mark that one up next week.
    Again, let me ask another question. At Enron, there were consequences for a lot of people. Several people went to jail from the company. Arthur Andersen, at the time one of the top two largest accounting firms in the world, went out of business.
    What happened to the credit rating agencies that rated Enron's financial status?
"
Mr. Dobilas," I guess I just want to make a point.
    They're still in business. You know--
"
Mr. Capuano," Bingo.
"
Mr. Dobilas," --but in a subscription-based service like Realpoint on the secondary side, I mean, we would be out of business, too. Our clients would just walk away. I mean--
"
Mr. Capuano," I get it. And that's one of the things I'm trying to get at. I think that is one of the key factors.
    I don't understand why I have to accept the fact that issuer-paid business will continue to go on forever. I mean, again, if that's the case, big red stamp on the front of this, you know, ``Endorsed by us,'' as opposed to, ``Endorsed for you.''
    And I guess the last factor I have is, we talk as if somehow credit rating agencies are just out there doing God's work, and that's it. Most, up until recently, most of the large investors, up until the last 5 years, were institutional investors. Now we get hedge funds, private equity firms, and all that, and different problems we're trying to deal with.
    But most institutional investors are required to invest only in certain rated stock, or actually prohibited from investing in other stock. That's a captive audience. That means your rating is critical.
    As we see here right now, one of the biggest problems I have, or the biggest disagreements I have, probably maybe the only one, at the moment, of major import, with account administration is the proposal on this public-private investment program. I hate it. I hate it for lots of different reasons.
    One reason I hate it is, in this program, it says you can only buy AAA-rated bonds. Excuse me? You rated them AAA. They went bad. They're now junk, toxic, whatever words we're not using this week. And yet we can only invest in those. I'm missing something. Your ratings matter.
    And as far as the free speech goes, let me be very clear. You have every right to say anything you want. Go right ahead. You don't have a right to sell it. You don't.
    And I understand, I'm a lawyer, lawyers will disagree, and you know much more about the First Amendment than I do. I know one thing. You can't be running down the halls screaming, ``Fire,'' and you can't be running down the halls saying, ``There is no fire. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about that smoke that you see over there. Calm down.'' Well, you can, but you're going to be held liable for it.
    Now, we will find out whether the courts have completely gone completely nuts, which on occasion they do, and then luckily we get Presidents who get to appoint members of that court. I don't know where they're going to come down. But there is no rational person who can step back from the actual, maybe some of the specific cases, to say that you should have a right to sell and to move a market on the basis of, ``Don't worry about this fire.''
    Or, as a lawyer, one of the things I'm taught, don't ask questions you don't know the answers to, or don't ask questions you don't want to hear the answers to.
    Now, I don't know that any--have any of you ever been rated? Have you ever worked for a company that was rated? Any of you?
"
Mr. Pollock," Yes, I have, Congressman.
"
Mr. Capuano," Okay. I have, as well. And let me tell you something. My job, when you were rating me--actually, Fitch wouldn't do it--I don't know if--probably still not. I only had two to pick from, two, because the rest of you weren't in business. Fitch was the only one.
    And by the way, now that we're talking 10, just as a point of information, how much business is there that is controlled by S&P and Moody's? What's their share of the market, about?
"
Mr. Pollock," About 80 percent.
"
Mr. Capuano," About 80 percent, and Fitch is probably 10, give or take?
"
Mr. Joynt," I think 13.
"
Mr. Capuano," Okay, 15. So that leaves, you know, 5 to 10 percent of the market to the other seven. I would suggest that we're not at non-cartel type of competitive market yet.
    I understand some of the concerns you have, and I want to be clear. I have been one of the leading critics of the way credit rating agencies work. I'm not out to put you out of business. That's not what I want. I actually think I want you to be there. I want a strong, independent voice to help make--allow the market to make thoughtful judgments on investments. I think that's a good thing.
    I want independent auditors. I want independent lawyers. I think some of the lawyers have gotten away with murder, too. But we need independent, thoughtful, credit rating agencies who are not beholden to the people that they're working for.
    And with that, I'm actually just hoping that you help us find the way to get there, because otherwise, you're going to leave it up to us, and believe me, maybe I'm wrong, but I think this year, we're going to do it.
    So you have two choices. Either let us do it and not have any input, or help us do it the right way.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you, Mr. Capuano.
    Mr. Volokh, one question that I had. You mentioned that the First Amendment privilege was argued and decided in two circuit courts within the United States. However, I would imagine the defense of First Amendment privilege was used in cases, say, in Europe or Asia, and since they do not have the benefit of the First Amendment over there, do you recall any specific cases? Was there liability held that was not recognized as a defense?
"
Mr. Volokh," You know, I have a hard enough time keeping up with American law. I can't claim any real expertise as to foreign law. They don't have the First Amendment, and our free speech regime and our free speech history is notoriously much more protective of speech across a wide range of contexts than in Europe or certainly in Asia.
    My sense, also, is that, at least from what I have heard, we also have a much more aggressive tort liability system in the United States than there, so it may be that there was no free speech protection for you, but there are also no legal causes of action.
    In fact even in the United States, until recently, the dominant rule, and perhaps today still is the dominant rule, that just as a matter of tort law, there is generally only recklessness or knowledge-based liability, not negligence liability, in speech that's said to the public at large in these contexts.
    But I don't know much about foreign precedents in this. My guess is they're not going to be terribly enlightening.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," I think I hear a lot of lawyer boots running down the hall right now to buy steamship tickets. I am being facetious, relating it to ambulance chasing.
    Mr. Joynt, are you aware of any cases that are pending in Europe or suggested to be--
"
Mr. Joynt," I think also, like you suggested, that the tort prevalence in Europe is lower than it is here. I believe the rating agency, credit rating agency industry has just been thought about and reviewed in Europe by the European Parliament, and they chose not to move forward with some kind of expanded or specialized liability, but, you know, so easily, the SEC could inform you about why they chose not to do that, and how it might inform your judgment in this matter.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much.
    I did not realize you had come in, in the meantime, Mr. Royce, and here I am taking some of your time. So we will give you a little of whatever is left. I will recognize you for 5 minutes.
"
Mr. Royce," Mr. Chairman, I thank you for this hearing.
    I only have one question, but I think we have to get past the point of the hard-wiring of these rating references that exist in statutes, because we have set up a regulatory agency, or a cartel out of this, and I think that a lot of the problems, you know, Von Meese has had this theory, after he looked at the cartel arrangements in Europe, and all of them were drawn from a government franchise or a government-enabled or created cartel.
    And so if you could figure out a way to get this back to a market-based system where the regulators are not using these scores to determine whether banks are adequately capitalized, then you begin to signal that this isn't the score that you key off of.
    Right now, we certainly see, while the credit ratings issued by the NRSROs are intended to be opinions, as you discussed, and of course protected as opinions by the First Amendment, it appears that the treatment of these ratings by market participants is way beyond opinions. It seems that, you know, as Schwazerman, Steve Schwazerman of the Blackstone Group said, the grades issued by rating agencies, he said AAA has almost a religious connotation in finance, and if you call it a AAA, you don't have to analyze it. That's why it's a AAA--as he stated.
    So one of the more egregious abuses of these grades occurred when AIG used their AAA rating to sell abstract derivatives based on nothing more than junk mortgages.
    So to what extent do you believe the reliance upon the major credit rating agencies by Federal regulators encourages the belief that these ratings are more than just opinions? That would be my first question to the panel.
    And from a regulatory standpoint, how can we lessen the dependence upon NRSRO grades?
"
Mr. Pollock," If I could start, Congressman, I fully agree with your point that the regulatory treatment raises these ratings to beyond opinions, whereas what they really are is, indeed, opinions.
    And secondly, it would be very good, as I suggested in my testimony, to set all regulators, not only the SEC, to try to lessen the mandating of ratings in their regulations and to increasing competition in this sector.
"
Mr. Royce," Thank you, Mr. Pollock.
"
Mr. Auwaerter," Congressman, I think in the case of that discussion that you quoted about AAA securities being almost religious and the investor didn't have to do any analysis, that was errors on the part of the investor. They abrogated their fiduciary duties.
    I think regulations--excuse me--ratings have a place in regulation, sort of as a minimum standard, but it's still incumbent upon the investor to do the work.
    For example, in Rule 2-A(7), the regulations regarding using a credit rating agency set a minimum floor, and that's a minimum hurdle that, I, as a money fund portfolio manager, have to get over, but I am still required, under the SEC rules, to do my own independent analysis.
    What we get concerned about at Vanguard, in particular in the case of money market funds, is that you have a small money market fund that doesn't put the proper resources in, doesn't do their own homework, and they just say, ``Okay, we don't have to rely upon a rating agency, we just make a subjective assessment, and we end up being the best house in a block that's burning down.''
"
Mr. Royce," Thank you.
    Any of the other members on the panel?
"
Mr. Joynt," I'm not sure you were here earlier when I had mentioned that the recent SEC hearings, that SEC--S&P and Moody's both had suggested that removing ratings from regulation in that way would be something they think would be okay with them.
    So I'm not here representing a different, an industry view. I happen to think that the reason ratings are used in regulation in many places is because when they were put in there, it was deemed constructive and helpful, so that was just one example there.
    So I suggest if we're going to go back and think about their usage now, because of the way we perceive rating agencies as being over-relied upon, that it just be done carefully and sort of individually, not in a blanket kind of way, because there must have been some good reasons.
"
Mr. Royce," Would you agree with getting them out of statutes, and would you agree with Alex's point?
"
Mr. Joynt," I think it depends. I think the use of ratings as a basic benchmark in 2-A(7) is a constructive use. If there was an alternative, then I think that could be used.
    In other cases, maybe the ratings' usefulness is not as great as it was originally intended for.
    Someone cited the number of regulations that are used, including State ones, and it's 200 in the States and 50, and I think they ought to be looked at individually.
    I think the SEC is doing that right now, I believe, so looking at least at the ones that they use for net capital rules for broker dealer and other things.
"
Mr. Royce," Any other responses?
"
Mr. Dobilas," I would just echo that, as well. I think what ratings really do is, you know, give you a minimum standard. I think that is really important.
    I think it also enables small investors and small upstart companies to get into the field without adding, you know, a staff of 40, you know, individuals, who are going to try to rate the securities.
    What we're really there to do is provide, you know, again, I hate to beat a dead horse, but an opinion on credit, and identify possible risks within the deal, and I think some of those statutes were meant to, you know, ensure there is some sort of analysis done.
    I mean, we ran into problems when we relied too heavily on broker dealer research. Ratings were supposed to be seen as more independent, and, you know, give you that basic sense of security in the sense of opinions.
"
Mr. Royce," Mr. Smith?
"
Mr. Smith," I think that my answer would be along the lines of what's going to come in place of them, and I don't mean to be flippant by that at all.
    I mean that there has to be something, some measuring stick for us to know what the insurance company can hold as reserve capital for their obligations, or what the money market can have in its portfolio and continue to represent itself as same as cash type of an investment. What tool are we going to use to fill that need?
    And really, these regulations, in my view, came about to allow insurance companies and banks and so forth to not just have to hold cash. We wanted to look for what's secure enough that we can rely that it's always going to be there, but it doesn't have to be cash. You can make just a little bit of a margin, a little bit of money on it on the edges, and you don't have to flat-out hold cash.
    That's really how this all started. That's where we started identifying, well, as long as it's AAA, then you can hold it and meet your capital requirements with your AAA-rated instruments. And--
"
Mr. Royce," And we're still left with the reality that AIG used their AAA rating to sell abstract derivatives based on nothing more than junk mortgages.
"
Mr. Smith," Absolutely, and that's because the AAA rating is unreliable, and that's what we have to get back to, to me, to say, well, we're not going to call it AAA anymore, fine. That's fine. What are we going to use as our measuring stick to identify what those entities can hold, unless we're going to make them hold cash, which I don't think is going to be productive for everybody. How are we going to measure it now? How are we going to define it now? If we're not going to define it by terms of these credit ratings, how are we going to define that?
"
Mr. Royce," Any further commentary?
    [no response]
"
Mr. Royce," Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you, Mr. Royce.
    The gentleman from Alabama seeks recognition?
"
Mr. Bachus," Thank you. Yes, please.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," You are recognized.
"
Mr. Bachus," You know, one thing, we received word, I guess just today, or the last day or so, that the regulators are going to expand the number of companies who can issue opinions on the CMBS market and TALF, which is--at least, I think they're moving in the right direction.
    And I know, Mr. Pollock, you have pointed out that you felt like that was--they were going too much to endorse certain companies or create a duopoly.
"
Mr. Pollock," Yes, sir.
"
Mr. Bachus," So I do commend the agencies for doing that.
    Mr., and it was ``Dobilas,'' is that--I heard you and Mr. Neugebauer; is that right?
"
Mr. Dobilas," That's perfect.
"
Mr. Bachus," Is that what you came down with?
"
Mr. Dobilas," Yes.
"
Mr. Bachus," On Page 4 of your written testimony, you say, even in the midst of the unprecedented economic conditions, that Realpoint was able to issue accurate credit downgrades 6 to 9 months sooner than your largest competitors.
"
Mr. Dobilas," Correct.
"
Mr. Bachus," How were you able to evaluate the creditworthiness so far in advance of the other rating agencies, and can you give us an example of this?
"
Mr. Dobilas," Sure. Our emphasis is really on, you know, surveillance of these bonds. You know, our company is a small company compared to the Big Three, and I would label us as a niche company into CMBS securities. We have approximately 50 employees. All 50 are dedicated to the review and surveillance of the underlying collateral.
    And I think a big difference is, we have monthly surveillance, and we try to be fully transparent to our investors.
    So, we gather information on a monthly basis. We analyze information. We see trends happening. And we're very proactive with regards to our ratings and those trends.
    You know, at one point, before Realpoint became an NRSRO, every rating agency subscribed to our service as a research provider for the basic surveillance capabilities we offered.
    When we got the NRSRO, you know, that's when things changed a little bit, and again, we lost some market share, you know, at that time.
    But the most part is, we have monthly surveillance, we do a very good job with regards to understanding data, understanding market trends, and we have to service our clients, who are the investors.
    The investors really don't want to know 6 months after the fact that a security has gone bad, and we try to provide that service through better quality and better service.
"
Mr. Bachus," Do you think that some of the other rating agencies that lag behind, were they seeing the same data, or do you think it was--
"
Mr. Dobilas," They were seeing the same data, and I don't think all rating agencies on the surveillance front are equal, in the sense I think some rating agencies do a much better job at surveillance than others, but they--we were all seeing the same amount of information and data. It's when do you process that information.
    If you're focused on the new issue markets, and getting into that business, and all your energy and resources are there, you're really not going to focus too much on surveillance, especially in a busy market. And again, not all rating agencies have that same focus.
    You know, I would like to stick up for Fitch in this sense, and say they have a very good surveillance program, and were seeing a lot of data, and again, their ratings, you know, have not seen the increases that Moody's and S&P have.
"
Mr. Bachus," So they did a better job?
"
Mr. Dobilas," They did a better job.
"
Mr. Bachus," Okay. That's some good news.
    Mr. Joynt, do you have some--
"
Mr. Joynt," Yes. It's nice to be endorsed by someone.
"
Mr. Bachus," Thank you. Maybe that will get in a newspaper article tomorrow. You'll be rewarded for being sent out here all by yourself.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Thank you very much.
    I assume Mr. Garrett has no further questions, and I have 100 questions, but you all have been here very long and tediously. We appreciate it. I think it was very helpful to the committee. I think we had some interesting questions.
    And maybe I should, Mr. Joynt, thank you, because it was a bit of courage on your part to come forward and put your head out there, and you must really trust the operators of the guillotine.
"
Mr. Joynt," I'll come again if asked.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," That is very good. And we will welcome you back.
    Thank you all very much. We appreciate it. And the Chair notes that some members may have additional questions for the panel, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to these witnesses and place their responses in the record.
"
Mr. Bachus," Mr. Chairman?
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Yes, sir?
"
Mr. Bachus," S&P and Moody's at some later time, I guess, and maybe Sheldon, the cousin, will be called before the committee?
"
Chairman Kanjorski," Well, if you would like, we are going to try. We have a host of hearings. You know how many issues lie in our subcommittee. But I would be perfectly willing to find the time, if you will cooperate with us.
"
Mr. Bachus," I will. I would like to hear from all three.
"
Chairman Kanjorski," We will work on that.
    Before we adjourn, the following will be made part of the record of this hearing: A letter from the Association for Financial Professionals. And there being no further business before the committee, without objection, it is ordered that the letter be made a part of the record.
    The panel is dismissed and the hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 5:12 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
