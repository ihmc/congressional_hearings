"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Let me welcome our guests who are in the hearing room this morning, as well as to welcome our very distinguished panel of witnesses, and we thank the four of you and the second panel that is going to come as well. I have informed our colleagues already, those who are here, and others, we are under some time constraints. We have a couple of votes around 10:30 that are coming up on the floor of the Senate. There is a meeting that we are going to have that begins a little after noon that many of us are going to have to attend later. So we are not going to make any opening statements, including the Chairman and the Ranking Member. We have agreed this morning just to get right to our witnesses. I know my colleague from Tennessee would like that precedent, I tell you. He has been dying for that moment for 2 years.","Speech",""
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, when he was mayor, nobody spoke.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","No, no. Just the mayor spoke. We are not setting precedent here, but we are certainly going to, this morning, move in that direction. So let me thank again everyone for being with us this morning. Obviously, strengthening and streamlining prudential bank supervision is a major subject matter. We have had I do not know how many hearings. What is the number? Twenty-eight hearings since January on this subject matter of financial modernization regulations. And, obviously, this is a very critical piece to the extent we are going to have consolidation of our financial regulators. And so I welcome our witnesses here this morning. Many-- well, all of you have been before us on numerous occasions to talk about the various aspects of the financial troubles our Nation has been in over the last number of years. And I just want to make one point, and I know all of you at the table pretty well, and I know you understand this because I believe you care about this as well. Our job, obviously, here is not to protect regulators. Our job is, obviously, to protect the people who count on us and you and the system to provide the safety and soundness and the stability of the financial markets. That is what this is all about. And I know you get that and understand that, but I sometimes think we need to clear the air a little bit to make sure people understand what we are talking about as we describe the structure and the architecture that will provide that sense of stability and safety and soundness that we are looking for. So, with that, let me just turn directly, if I can, to you, Sheila, to start in on this. I will ask you to try and be brief. Again, all the documents and all of my colleagues' opening statements will be included in the record at this point here. We will try and be a little more careful on the clock than we might otherwise be because of time constraints. Jim, I am just explaining we have got some votes in an hour and a half or so. We are going to try and move along to the extent possible. Sheila, we thank you again for being with us.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Thank you, Senator Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. Today you have asked us to address the regulatory consolidation aspects of the Administration's proposal and whether there should be further consolidation. The yardstick for any reform should be whether it deals with the fundamental causes of the current crisis and helps guard against future crises. Measured by that yardstick, we do not believe the case has been made for regulatory consolidation of State and Federal charters. Among the many causes of the current crisis, the ability to choose between a State and Federal charter was not one of them. As a consequence, we see little benefit to regulatory consolidation and the potential for great harm and its disruptive impact and greater risk of regulatory capture and dominance by large banking organizations. The simplicity of a single bank regulator is alluring. However, such proposals have rarely gained traction in the past because prudential supervision of FDIC-insured banks has, in fact, worked well compared to the regulatory structures used for other U.S. financial sectors and to those used overseas. Indeed, this is evidenced by the fact that large swaths of the so-called ``shadow banking sector'' have collapsed back into the healthier insured sector. And U.S. banks, notwithstanding the current problems, entered this crisis with stronger capital positions and less leverage than their international competitors. A significant cause of the crisis was the exploitation of regulatory gaps between banks and the shadow nonbank financial system and virtually no regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives contracts. There were also gaps in consumer protection. To address these problems, we have previously testified in support of a systemic risk council that would help assure coordination and harmonization of prudential standards among all types of financial institutions. And a council would address regulatory arbitrage among the various financial sectors. We also support a new consumer agency to assure strong rules and enforcement of consumer protection across the board. However, we do not see merit or wisdom in consolidating all Federal banking supervision. The risk of weak or misdirected regulation would be exacerbated by a single Federal regulator that embarked on a wrong policy course. Prudent risk management argues strongly against putting all your regulatory and supervisory eggs in one basket. One of the advantages of multiple regulators is that it permits diverse viewpoints to be heard. For example, during the discussion of Basel II, the FDIC voiced deep and strong concerns about the reduction in capital that would have resulted. Under a unified regulator, the advanced approaches of Basel II could have been implemented much more quickly and with fewer safeguards, and banks would have entered this crisis with much lower levels of capital. Also, there is no evidence that shows a single financial regulatory structure was better at avoiding the widespread economic damage of the past 2 years. Despite their single- regulator approach, the financial systems in other countries have all suffered during the crisis. Moreover, a single-regulator approach would have serious consequences for two mainstays of the American financial system: the dual banking system and deposit insurance. The dual banking system and the regulatory competition and diversity that it generates is credited with spurring creativity and innovation in financial products and the organization of financial activities. State-chartered institutions tend to be community-oriented and very close to the small businesses and customers they serve. They provide the funding that supports economic growth and job creation, especially in rural areas. Main Street banks also are sensitive to market discipline because they know they are not too big to fail and that they will be closed if they become insolvent. A unified supervisory approach would inevitably focus on the largest banks to the detriment of community banking. In turn, this could cause more consolidation in the banking industry at a time when efforts are underway to reduce systemic exposure to very large financial institutions and to end ``too big to fail.'' Concentrating examination authority in a single regulator also could hurt bank deposit insurance. The loss of an ongoing and significant supervisory role would greatly diminish the effectiveness of the FDIC's ability to perform a congressional mandate. It would hamper our ability to reduce systemic risk through risk-based premiums and to contain the costs of deposit insurance by identifying, assessing, and taking actions to mitigate risk to the Deposit Insurance Fund. To summarize, the regulatory reforms should focus on eliminating the regulatory gaps I have just outlined. Proposals to create a unified supervisor would undercut the many benefits of our dual banking system and would reduce the effectiveness of deposit insurance, and, most importantly, they would not address the fundamental causes of the current crisis. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and I apologize, Sheila, for not properly introducing you here as the Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. I kind of assume everybody knows who you are, so I kind of jumped into that, and I apologize. John Dugan is the Comptroller of the Currency, and we thank you very much, a well-known figure to this Committee, having served on this side of the dais for a number of years and now at the OCC. So we thank you, John.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the Administration's proposal for regulatory reform. The OCC supports many elements of the proposal, including the establishment of a council of financial regulators to identify and monitor systemic risk and enhanced authority to resolve systemically significant financial firms. We also believe it would be appropriate to establish a consolidated supervisor of all systemically significant financial firms. The Federal Reserve already plays this role for the largest bank holding companies, but during the financial crisis, the absence of a comparable supervisor for large securities and insurance firms proved to be an enormous problem. The proposal would fill this gap by extending the Federal Reserve's holding company regulation to such firms, which we believe would be appropriate. However, one aspect of the proposal goes much too far, which is to grant broad new authority to the Federal Reserve to override the primary banking supervisor on standards, examination, and enforcement applicable to the bank. Such override power would fundamentally undermine the authority and accountability of the banking supervisor. We also support the proposal to effectively merge the OTS into the OCC with a phase-out of the Federal Thrift Charter. My written testimony responds in detail to the Chairman's questions about options for additional banking agency consolidation by: first, establishing either the Federal Reserve or the FDIC as the single Federal agency responsible for regulating State-chartered banks; second, establishing a single prudential supervisor to supervise all national and State banks; and, third, transferring all holding company regulation from the Federal Reserve to the prudential supervisor. While there are significant potential benefits to be gained from all three proposals, there are also potential costs, especially with removing the Federal Reserve altogether from the holding company regulation of systemically important companies. Finally, we support enhanced consumer financial protection standards and believe that a dedicated consumer protection agency could help to achieve that goal. However, we have significant concerns with the parts of the proposed CFPA that would consolidate all financial consumer protection rulewriting, examination, and enforcement in a single agency which would completely divorce these functions from safety and soundness regulation. It makes sense to consolidate all consumer protection rulewriting in a single agency with the rules applying to all financial providers of a product, both bank and nonbank. But we believe the rules must be uniform and that banking supervisors must have meaningful input into formulating them. Unfortunately, the proposed CFPA falls short on both counts. First, the rules would not be uniform because the proposal would expressly authorize States to adopt different rules for all financial firms, including national banks, by repealing the Federal preemption that has always allowed national banks to operate under uniform Federal standards. This repeal of a uniform Federal standards option is a radical change that will make it far more difficult and costly for national banks to provide financial services to consumers in different States having different rules, and these costs will ultimately be borne by the consumer. The change will also undermine the national banking charter and the dual banking system that have served us well for nearly 150 years. Second, the rules do not afford meaningful input from banking supervisors, even on real safety and soundness issues, because in the event of any disputes, the proposed CFPA would always win. The new agency needs to have a strong mechanism for ensuring meaningful bank supervisor input into CFPA rulemaking. Finally, the CFPA should not take examination and enforcement responsibilities away from the banking agencies. The current bank supervisory process works well where the integration of consumer compliance and safety and soundness supervision provides real benefits for both functions. Moreover, moving bank examination and enforcement functions to the CFPA would only distract it from its most important and daunting implementation challenge--that is, establishing an effective enforcement regime for the shadow banking system of the literally tens of thousands of nonbank providers that are currently unregulated or lightly regulated, like mortgage brokers and originators. The CFPA's resources should be focused on this fundamental regulatory gap rather than on already regulated depository institutions. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN C. DUGAN, COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Dan Tarullo, from the Federal Reserve Board, we thank you, Dan, once again for coming before the Committee. Happy to hear your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, and other Members of the Committee. Before the final history of the financial crisis is written, I am certain that supervisory shortcomings in all kinds and sizes of financial institutions, will have been revealed. The crisis has also shown that the framework for prudential supervision and regulation has not kept pace changes in the structure, activities, and interrelationships of the financial sector. In my prepared testimony, I have suggested and tried to elaborate the elements of an effective framework for prudential supervision, including a number of recommendations for legislative actions. Knowing of your time constraints this morning, let me confine these introductory remarks to three quick points. First, prudential supervision must be required for all systemically important institutions. It is noteworthy that a number of the firms at the heart of the crisis had not been subject to mandatory prudential supervision of any sort. Improving the quality of supervision will fall short of realizing the maximum potential gains for financial stability if important institutions can escape the rules and requirements associated with the supervisory process. Second, there must be effective supervision of the companies that own insured depository institutions, a task that is distinct from the supervision of the banks themselves. Large organizations increasingly manage their businesses on an integrated basis, with little regard for the corporate boundaries that typically define the jurisdiction of individual functional supervisors. There is need for close scrutiny of the linkages between the banks and other affiliates within a holding company--not just straightforward financial or contractual ties, but also managerial, operational, and reputational linkages. The premise of so-called ``functional regulation''--that risks within a diversified organization can be successfully evaluated and controlled through supervision within each individual firm--has been belied by the experience of the financial crisis. Third, it is important to emphasize that much of what needs to be done to improve and adapt our system of prudential supervision lies within the existing authorities of the agencies represented at this table. Together, we have acted to shut down the practice of converting charters in order to escape enforcement actions or adverse supervisory ratings. We are working together in international fora to assure that all internationally active financial institutions are subject to effective regulation. The Federal Reserve is adjusting its approach to prudential supervision, particularly of the largest banking organizations. Building on the experience of the unprecedented Supervisory Capital Assessment Program, or SCAP, we are expanding our use of horizontal examinations to assess key operations, risks, and risk management of large institutions. We are creating an enhanced quantitative surveillance mechanism that will draw on a multidisciplinary group of economists and other experts to create and evaluate scenarios that cross large firms. These top-down analyses will provide an independent supervisory perspective on the bottom-up work of supervisory teams. The two perspectives will be joined in a well-coordinated process involving both the supervisory teams and Washington staff. Thank you all for your attention. I look forward to discussing both agency and congressional initiatives to strengthen further our prudential supervisory system.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Governor. I will now turn to our last witness, John Bowman, who is the Acting Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. John, we welcome you once again to the Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Good morning, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and other Members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the Administration's proposal for financial regulatory reform. It is my pleasure to address this Committee for the first time in my role as Acting Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. I will begin my testimony by outlining the core principles I believe are essential to accomplishing true and lasting reform. Then I will address specific questions you asked regarding the Administration's proposal. Let me start with the four principles. One, ensure that changes to the financial regulatory system address real problems. We all agree that the system has real problems and needs real reform. What we must determine, as we consider each proposed change, is whether the proposal would fix what is broken. In the rush to address what went wrong, let us not try to fix nonexisting problems or try to fix real problems with flawed solutions. Two, ensure uniform regulation. One of the biggest lessons learned from the current economic crisis is that all entities offering financial products to consumers must be subject to the same rules. Underregulated entities competing in the financial marketplace have a corrosive, damaging impact on the entire system. Also, complex derivative products such as credit default swaps should be regulated. Three, ensure that systemically important firms are effectively supervised and, if necessary, wound down in an orderly manner. No provider of financial products should be too big to fail, achieving through size and complexity an implicit Federal Government guarantee to prevent its collapse. The U.S. economy operates on the principle of healthy competition. Enterprises that are strong, industrious, well managed, and efficient succeed and prosper. Those that fall short of the mark struggle or fail, and other stronger enterprises take their places. Enterprises that become too big to fail subvert the system. When the Government is forced to prop up failing systemically important computers, it is, in essence, supporting poor performance and creating a moral hazard. Let me be clear. I am not advocating a cap on size, just effective, robust authority for properly regulating and resolving the largest and most complex financial institutions. Number four, ensure that consumers are protected. A single agency should have the regulation of financial products as its central mission. That agency should establish the rules and standards for all consumer financial products, regardless of the issuer of those products, rather than having multiple agencies with fragmented authority and a lack of singular accountability. Regarding feedbacks on the questions the Committee asked, the OTS does not support the Administration's proposal to eliminate the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision, transferring the employees of each into a national bank supervisory agency or for the elimination of the Federal Thrift Charter. Failures by insured depository institutions have been no more severe among thrifts than among institutions supervised by other Federal banking regulators. If you look at the numbers of failed institutions, most have been State-chartered banks whose primary Federal regulator is not the OTS. If you look at the size of failed institutions, you see that the Federal Government prevented the failures of the largest banks that collapsed by authorizing open bank assistance. These too-big-to-fail institutions are not and were not regulated by the OTS. The argument about bank shopping for the most lenient regulator is also without merit. Most financial institutions and more assets have converted away from OTS supervision in the last 10 years than have converted to OTS supervision. In the same way the thrift charter is not part of the problem, we do not see any reason to cause major disruptions with the hundreds of legitimate, well-run financial businesses that are operating successfully with the thrift charter and making credit available to American consumers. My written testimony contains detailed information you requested about the proposed elimination of the exceptions in the Bank Holding Company Act for thrifts and certain special-purpose banks and about the Federal Reserve System's prudential supervision of holding companies. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, and I would be happy to answer any questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN E. BOWMAN, ACTING DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Bowman. Let me ask the clerk to put the clock on here for about 6 minutes per Member, and I have two questions I want to raise with you, if time permits, and then I will turn to Senator Shelby. First of all, for decades--and I have been on this Committee for a number of years, and we have had commissions and think tanks and regulators, presidents, Banking Committee Chairs. John, you will remember sitting behind us back here at that table with parties recommending the consolidation of Federal banking supervision. Bill Proxmire, who sat in this chair for a number of years, proclaimed the U.S. system of regulation to be, and I quote, ``the most bizarre and tangled financial regulatory system in the world.'' Former FDIC Chairman, Sheila, Chairman William Seidman, called it ``complex, inefficient, outmoded, and archaic.'' In the wake of the last bank and thrift crisis, when hundreds of institutions failed, the Clinton administration urged Congress to consolidate the Federal banking regulators into a single prudential regulator. So here we have seen Administrations, Chairs of this Committee, and others over the years, all at various times, in the wake of previous crises, call for consolidation, and yet we did not act after those crises. We sat back and basically left pretty much the system we have today intact. And as a result, we have had some real costs ranging from inefficiencies and redundancies to the lack of accountability and regulatory laxity. We are now paying a very high price for those shortcomings. So my first question is--the Administration, as you all know and you have commented on, has proposed the consolidation of the OCC and OTS, but leaves in place the three Federal bank regulators. My question is simply: Putting the safety and soundness of the banking system first, is the Administration proposal really enough? Or should we not be listening to the admonition of previous Administrations? And people have sat in this chair who have recommended greater consolidation that ought to be the step taken. Sheila, we will begin with you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","As I indicated in my opening statement, we do not think that the ability to choose between the Federal and State charter was any kind of a significant driver or had any kind of an impact at all on the activities that led to this current crisis. The key problems were arbitrage between more heavily regulated banks and nonbanks, and then the OTC derivatives sector, which was pretty much completely unregulated. I do support merging OCC and OTS. That is reflective of market conditions, but that doesn't need to be about whether there is a weak regulator or strong regulator. I think that is just a reflection of the market and the lack of current market interest in a specialty charter to do just mortgage lending or heavily concentrate on mortgage lending. In fact, some of the restrictions on the thrift charter perhaps have impeded the ability of those thrifts to undertake additional diversification. So, Mr. Chairman, I would have to respectfully disagree in terms of drivers of what went on this time around. I really do not see that as a symptom of the fact that you have four different regulators overseeing different charters for FDIC- insured institutions. And I do think that the banks held up pretty well compared to the other sectors. They did have higher capital standards and more extensive regulation.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just ask you and the other panelists to comment on this. Clearly, we are looking back in the rearview mirror as to what happened, and that is certainly a motivation here. But it is not the sole motivation. It is not just a question of addressing the problems that occurred, but going forward, in the 21st century, in a very different time, in a global economy today--we saw the implications of what happened not only here in this country but around the world. The idea that we would maintain the same architecture we have for decades is not only a question about what has occurred and whether or not the system responded well enough to it, but looking forward as to whether or not this architecture and structure is going to be sufficient to protect the safety and soundness in a very different economic environment than existed at the time these agencies emerged through the process of growth over the years. It seems to me that is just as important question as looking back.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think it is a very important question, and I am very glad you are having these hearings. But I do not think that this is going to solve the problems that led to this crisis. Looking at the performance of other models in European countries that have a single regulator, the performance is not particularly good. I do think there is a profound risk of regulatory capture by very large institutions if you collapse regulatory oversight into one single entity. I think having multiple voices is beautiful. We testified before this Committee on the Advanced Approaches under Basel II. We resisted that, and we slowed it down. And because of that, our banks--commercial banks, FDIC- insured banks--had not transitioned into that new system, which would have significantly lowered the amount of capital they would have had going into this crisis, unlike what happened in Europe and with investment banks. So we think having multiple voices can actually strengthen regulation and guard against regulatory capture. If you have a single monopoly regulator, there is not going to be another regulator out there saying, ``We are going to have a higher standard,'' ``We are going to be stronger,'' or ``We are going to question that.'' I think you lose that with a single regulator. So you should look carefully at the European models and how they functioned during the crisis.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","We are talking here--John, let me ask you, we are talking about a consumer financial product safety agency. Obviously, the Fed is very much here. We are talking about that as well and having a prudential regulator. Why is that not necessarily the kind of checks and balances we are talking about in the system?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I cannot really defend the current system of so many regulators. As one of my predecessors used to say, it does not work in theory, but we have worked hard to make it work in practice. And having said that, I think there is more you could do if you were so inclined, and you have gone from four regulators to three prudential regulators in the proposal. You could go the next step to have a single regulator for State-chartered institutions, which would bring you down to two. You could go to one regulator for the banks, and you could even bring in the holding company regulation to the prudential supervisor. As I mentioned in my testimony, there are advantages and disadvantages in each of those steps. I think at the end of the day, if you put everything all in one place, it would be probably too much. And so I think that is probably a bridge too far, but there are things that you could do that would simplify things for the future. I do not believe, and agree with Sheila, that this was a principal contributing cause of this crisis. But I think going forward we do have to think hard about what is the best system for the future, and giving those matters real thought is a good thing.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Dan and John, some quick responses to my question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Mr. Chairman, among the many reasons why Members of this Committee will not be unhappy to see the summer recess come is they will not have to listen to me say, for about the third hearing in a row, that each proposal that comes before us is going to have some advantages and some disadvantages. I do think, as John and Sheila have suggested, that nobody would sit down and write the system we have now if they were starting from scratch. But the system having been in place, you have seen that there are some advantages to splitting bank supervision. I personally think it would be a very bad idea not to have the deposit insurer have a bank examination function, so that the deposit insurer understands how banks are functioning before they fail, and thus be better able to resolve them. I also think that it is important for the Federal Reserve, as the central bank and as the holding company supervisor, to have a window into how banks function. Would there be efficiency gains in some sense from having a single regulator? There probably would be, but I think my colleagues to my right have already pointed out some of the disadvantages as well.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","John.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","I would agree with some of the disadvantages that have been pointed out. I think the other question that we would have is the form that the current system holds, a multiple of regulators, really the cause of the issue we are dealing with today? And I would suggest that, in fact, the principal cause, as the Administration says in its proposal-- high-cost loans, only 6 percent of the high-cost loans provided American consumers were provided by depository institutions that were regulated under the current system; 94 percent were provided by the so-called ``shadow banking regulator.'' That is why we would suggest the focus really should be on filling the regulatory gaps that exist today and that really need to be filled.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Shelby.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, just for the record, just my observation, I would think that if you look at the record here of the failure of the regulatory bodies, that all roads seem to lead to the Federal Reserve. They don't lead to the FDIC. They don't lead to the Comptroller. They don't lead to the Community Bank Supervisor. But just about all of them lead to the Fed, and let us be honest about it. I want to get into something else. Chairman Bernanke has testified before this Committee that this crisis has revealed that our Nation's ``too-big-to-fail'' problem is much worse than many thought. After the bailouts of Bear Stearns, AIG, Chrysler, and GM, our markets now have good reason to expect that the Federal Government will bail out any prominent company that gets into financial trouble, perhaps. My question to you is, what steps need to be taken to restore market discipline and minimize the moral hazard created by the bailouts over the past year? Is this a problem that will not be solved until the Federal Government actually allows several prominent institutions to fail? In other words, we are going down a road, a dead-end road on the ``too-big-to-fail'' thing. Sheila.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, we very much agree with you, Senator, and that is why when I have testified before this Committee previously our priority focus has been on resolution authority. We need a mechanism that can resolve very large financial organizations in a way that is orderly, that protects the rest from any systemic implications, but makes sure that their creditors and shareholders take losses. We don't have that right now and I don't think we are going to get that restored market discipline until Congress puts something like that in place.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","John.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I agree that we need a better mechanism to have more orderly resolutions of companies that get into trouble so that you can have more instances where you don't have threats to the system just by resolving them. I think you need to do more up front by way of capital requirements and liquidity requirements so they don't get into that position. And I think you will have more circumstances where larger institutions can be failed in an orderly manner. I do think, however, that you have to preserve some flexibility for the Government----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","----in emergency circumstances where the entire system is threatened, like we were last fall, to be able to address that concern, and I know that is hard, but I think you really need to do that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Governor.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I certainly agree with the utility of the resolution mechanism, but when you ask about market discipline, I think there is more that we need to do. The resolution mechanism comes at the end of the day. It comes at the time of failure. It would be better to create additional incentives that preclude the failure. We surely need more transparency and disclosure by financial institutions, particularly the largest. And as I have indicated a couple of times in prepared testimony, I think we also need to be looking at alternative requirements for the capital structure of at least large institutions. There are a number of ideas out there that would require certain kinds of convertible debt to be in the capital structure of a company. That is good because there is market discipline as long as it is a debt instrument. The debt holders want to be paid. And they know if the financial institution gets into trouble, that that debt will be converted into equity. It will provide a buffer against loss and they will be subject to loss. So I think that market discipline has a number of different avenues that we should pursue, and market discipline itself should be pursued alongside of some other regulatory mechanisms. Senator, if I could, you know I was not at the Federal Reserve up until a few months ago, and as I have said repeatedly, I really do believe here is plenty of blame to go around everywhere. But I don't honestly think that all roads lead to the Fed on this. I mean, Bear Stearns----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Well, which don't lead to them?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I would say, Senator, Bear Stearns, AIG, Lehman, Fannie and Freddie. There were a lot of problems in this system, and as I said earlier, I think before this crisis is over, we are going to have seen a lot of failures in a lot of kinds of institutions. I don't say that to try to deflect any responsibility. In fact, I think part of what I was trying to say in my prepared remarks and in the introductory remarks was that I and everybody on the Board takes seriously where things didn't get regulated as well as they should have and where the structure needs work, and that is why we started to make the changes we are already making.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Just for the record, and we all know this, but who is the regulator, the primary regulator of the holding companies, the big banks that got into trouble? You know it is your Federal Reserve, and you are now--you weren't, but you are now a member of the Board of Governors. Let us be honest about it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, that is absolutely true, Senator. In some cases, the bank is regulated by other regulatory agencies and there are also entities----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","But the primary regulator of the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Of the holding companies, right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","----is the Federal Reserve. I haven't got much time, but I want to pick up on a couple of things. Today's Wall Street Journal had a tough article dealing with Secretary Geithner when he met with a bunch of you, where he told the financial regulators that they should stop--can you imagine the gall here of the Secretary--that they should stop criticizing the Obama administration regulatory reform plan. My gosh. I hope you won't quit. I think your honesty and your candor here is very important. We recognize the role of the Treasury to set some policy for financial regulation. But ultimately, it is going to be the Congress up here. This Committee, both sides of the aisle, and the House is going to set the tone and create the laws. And I appreciate you bringing this independent perspective with all kinds of pressure placed on you. Does the testimony that you have given here today, that you have provided, is that your own views, such as it was, not in any way influenced by Secretary Geithner's tirade against you the other day? It is a serious question. Is this your----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Who are you asking the question of here? Which one of these----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I was asking all of them.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, it is our own testimony. Congress requires and prohibits the Treasury Department from intervening in any legislative view we express to the Committee. We do not clear our statements through the Treasury Department and we take that independent function very, very seriously.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Sheila.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes. I don't think anybody thinks we are not independent. It was absolutely our testimony.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","We hope you are going to stay independent.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I will.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Governor.","Speech"," "

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Brown","","Speech"," "
"Senator Brown","Thank you. I was a little surprised by Senator Shelby's question, considering the positions that you have all taken. Let me look at this in kind of a different way. The public has a general understanding. The investing public and the victims of this financial disaster, which is my whole State and most of this country, has a general understanding that regulation of financial institutions, putting it mildly, fell far short. Some have the belief that the most, I think the most egregious institutions found an agency that was too easy on them. In Washington, we call that regulator shopping. They just think that the Government, for whatever reason, was too easy on Wall Street greed. And I hear each of you. There may be some turf issues, and that may be a cynical way to look at it and I apologize if that is the way you take it, but I hear the--I see the President's plan, the President's proposed bank supervision framework. I hear each of you disputing major parts of it. How would you explain to the American public what the next step is? How do we fill the financial gaps in our financial regulatory system if consolidation of regulators is not the best move? How do you explain to the public why four very smart people playing very important roles in our financial institution regulatory system and an Administration that, I think, has equally smart people that understand this, why is there not more agreement? How do you explain in understandable terms, if you were talking directly to the American people now, not to this Committee, what we should do to fill these gaps so these kinds of egregious, awful things don't happen again? I will start with you, Ms. Bair.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think there was arbitrage, but it was between the bank and the nonbank sectors. It was excess leverage with investment banks and hedge funds and other types of vehicles versus the higher leverage in risk-based capital requirements that we had for commercial banks. On consumer protection, it was third-party mortgage originators that were not affiliated with insured depository institutions originating loans being funded by Wall Street funding vehicles. The third-party mortgage originators were pretty much outside of any type of prudential or consumer protection standards that were within the purview of the banking regulators. So I think it is unfortunate the word ``bank'' is used for just about every institution, but in my world, a bank is an FDIC-insured institution. While we all made mistakes, the insured depository institution sector has held up pretty well. This is why you saw in December so many financial companies fleeing to become bank holding companies and trying to grow their insured institutions, because that was the sector that was left standing, which is hard for the FDIC because our exposure has increased significantly. We have tried to do the things we need to do to stabilize the system. But, this has increased our exposure significantly. As I have testified before, the arbitrage is between the banks and the nonbanks. Having a consumer agency with a focus especially on examination and enforcement of the nonbank sector and having a Systemic Risk Council that would have the authority to define systemic issues or systemic institutions, whether or not they voluntarily want to come in under the more stringent regulatory regime we have for banks and bank holding companies. The arbitrage was between the bank and the nonbank sectors. It was not among different types of bank charters, and certainly not between the choice of a State or Federal charter. There are 8,000 community banks in this country. Most of them have a State charter, so consequently, we regulate about 5,000 banks. I don't think they contributed to this, but you have seen traditional resistance among community banks to regulatory consolidation for fear, frankly, which I share, that inevitably there would be a regulatory viewpoint that would be dominated by the larger institutions if everyone was lumped in together. There is a valid reason for State charters. The community banks and State-chartered community banks tend to be more local in their interest and how they conduct their lending. To try to draw that issue into the much larger problems we had with arbitrage between banks and nonbanks and then the lack of regulation of derivatives, I think, is misguided and is not where you should be focusing your efforts or the American public should be focusing its efforts.","Speech"," "
"Senator Brown","Mr. Dugan, your thoughts?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I agree with everything Sheila just said. I would point out that we also regulate about a quarter of the Nation's community banks, so we do all different sizes of institutions. And most of the problems did not take place inside of the insured depository institutions that we supervise, which are the most extensively regulated parts of the system. Of course, we did make some mistakes and there were some problems. I am not discounting that. But that is not where most of them were. The second thing I would say is I think there are a number of very sound and strong proposals in the Administration's reform proposal, which I do support, as I testified. There are just some places where we think it should be shaped differently, and carrying out our duty to provide our views independently, that is what we are trying to suggest. With the CFPA, for example, we agree that a strong Federal consumer protection rulewriter to provide a single set of rules that applies to everybody is a very powerful change. But we think taking that same step and applying it to the enforcement and examination of the depository institutions should stay with the bank regulators where it works well, and instead, all of that effort should go to the examination, enforcement, and implementation of the nonbanking sector where there were very substantial problems that have led to disproportionately higher levels of foreclosures, for example, in your State and many of the States represented in this room.","Speech"," "
"Senator Brown","Thank you. Governor Tarullo.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Senator. If you are asking, what should the public be focused on, my suggestion would be too big to fail. That is not the only problem by a long shot, but to me, it continues to be the central problem--the ability to avoid the moral hazard that comes with ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions. As I said a moment ago, I think we need a variety of supervisory and regulatory tools to contain that problem, whether it is resolution, bringing systemically important institutions into the perimeter of regulation, making sure that the kinds of capital and liquidity requirements that systemically important institutions have will truly contain untoward risk taking. I think we are going to need a broad set of activities. ``Too big to fail'' was not the only cause, but it was at the center of this crisis and that is, I think, what we all need to focus on. The only other thing I would say harks back to a colloquy you and I had a couple of weeks ago when I was testifying. You and I were talking about attitudes and orientation and how people in the Congress and the regulatory agencies and the Administration think about issues and problems. It is not easy to ensure against people losing interest in issues. But I think that is a role that, in a system of Government that has a lot of checks and balances, we have to think about. How do we try to institutionalize skepticism and critical thinking, to look at developments in the financial world so that we don't just say, well, that is just another market development; it must be benign. But instead, we must begin to distinguish intelligently between benign, useful innovations on the one hand and building problems on the other.","Speech"," "
"Senator Brown","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Thank you, sir. One of the advantages of being last on a panel like this is you usually get to agree and sort of dispel the notion that we disagree on so many things. I agree with what my colleagues have said, but I would also like to focus on the arbitrage position between banks and nonbanks. I think the CFPA provision of the Administration's bill goes a long ways toward dealing with that situation. The difference is that you don't get to sell a product at a nonregulated entity under different terms and conditions, a different regulatory structure, than you would if you were doing so in a depository institution or otherwise regulated entity. I think that is one of the critical components of this Administration's proposal to fix that gap.","Speech"," "

"Senator Corker","","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and as always, I thank each of you for your testimony. I also, like I am sure most people did, read the story this morning in the Wall Street Journal regarding the meeting on Friday, and generally speaking, did it capture the essence of the attitude in the meeting?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Who is going to take that one?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Very briefly. I just want to move on to other----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, it was a candid conversation about our agencies' different views on the different subjects and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","It was a generally fair article?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","A lot of it was true.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","OK. So here is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I guess what I would like to get at, it is my understanding that the original draft had the National Banking Supervisor not being actually a part of Treasury. I think we have seen today that--and we have known for some time--Treasury can exercise--try to exercise influence over the organizations, and my understanding is that, again, in the beginning, the National Banking Supervisor was not a part of Treasury and at the last minute it was put back in. And I just wonder if one of the things we ought to be looking at is absolutely ensuring that this Banking Supervisor is not a part of Treasury and even more independent than has been laid out, very briefly.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","May I respond to that?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","This may surprise you, but I was a strong advocate of keeping it within the Treasury but subject to the same firewalls that we have now, which does give the agency a very strong ability to operate independently. I believe that making it independent and creating a new board, if you have three other regulators still in existence and everybody has got boards, I think it will confuse things. It is critical, however, that you do have those statutory firewalls that were put in place. And that was a position that I advocated.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Any differing opinions from the panel?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","As an independent agency that does the types of supervisory functions that the OCC and OTS perform, we look to them to help protect the Deposit Insurance Fund through their front line prudential supervision of banks that we insure. So, I think there are some merits in making it independent. As an independent agency, you do want to make sure it is as insulated as possible from any type of influences that might not be focused on prudential supervision and the safety and soundness of the institution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","OK. Thank you. Mr. Tarullo, I think I have actually been very supportive of our Chairman of the Federal Reserve, differing from some of the folks on the panel. And yet at the same time, there is no doubt the Federal Reserve had some failings in this last go around. I read your 2005, the Federal Reserve Service Purposes and Function document, and it actually does, just for what it is worth, state that one of your responsibilities is maintain the stability of the financial system and containing systemic risk that may arise in financial markets and providing financial services to depository institutions. So I think it is fair to say that, in essence, you sort of did have responsibility there. I am wondering how harboring all of that at the Federal Reserve would alter, if you will, behavior. I think all of us understand today that we need to be more concerned about systemic risk. I am sure the Fed does, too. And again, I say this with respect for the organization, but obviously with concerns. I am just wondering what would be different if, in fact, the Fed was the systemic regulator--the systemic regulator.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I don't think there are any proposals on the table that would really make the Fed a systemic risk regulator in the sense of being able to swoop in anywhere, anytime, and say, we want to do something about this. The proposal that we have endorsed is making the Federal Reserve the consolidated supervisor of systemically important institutions. I would say in direct response to your question, there is certainly a responsibility there, and I would be the first to say that responsibilities of all the financial regulators, including the Fed, were not exercised as effectively as they ought to have been. But I would also say that when you give an entity responsibility, you do have to make sure that you give it authority to achieve that responsibility, to fulfill it, and that you have the mechanisms that will allow it to do the job. And when you have a circumstance in which large institutions that turned out to be systemically important--I think in some cases to the surprise of many--and were not within the perimeter of regulation, it was obviously not going to be an easy matter to contain the activities of those institutions, including a lot of the wholesale funding and a lot of the very tightly wound, complex securitization that was a major contributor to these problems. So I would say, first, you need to make sure that the appropriate legal authorities are present. Second, as I have often said, there needs to be a reorientation of our regulatory approach more generally toward systemic risk. And third, the Federal Reserve, I think, needs to take more advantage of the comparative abilities that it has. That is why we wanted to move forward, to make use of the economic and financial expertise to provide a monitoring of and a check upon the on- the-ground supervisors. That is where the advantages lie and that is where we ought to bring them together.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Let me just ask one last question. I know there are differing thoughts on ``too big to fail,'' but each of you feel that that is a big issue, how to deal with that. I know that I would like to see a resolution mechanism in place where they resolve much like Chairman Bair proposes. Mr. Dugan, I don't understand how, if you continue to give Treasury the ability to solve the problem with taxpayer money if they deem it an important thing to do, I don't understand how that creates any market discipline. It seems to me that leaving that vague line in place defeats all market discipline. I don't understand how you can cause those to measure up or how we could craft something that actually worked and caused people like the Senator from Ohio's constituents and mine, which I think are different in thinking about some things, but I think they would agree that that is wrong, and yet you propose keeping it in place and I don't understand that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think there are ways that you have to limit it. I think there are presumptions so that you make it more difficult to exercise. I think there are measures that you have to take up front so you don't get yourself in that position. My only point, though, is this: when you are in a crisis and you need to take action and you need to do it to protect the financial stability of the system, I don't think we should tie the hands of the Government from being able to do it in a moment's notice if we have to. I don't ever want to be in some of the weekend situations that I was in last fall, and we did have mechanisms that ensured a wide variety of the Government was involved in the decisions. People can second-guess some of those judgments, but I really do not think it is a good idea to completely forbid the ability to address systemic situations and crises if we have to.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony. I gather from the panel that, in fact, there is a sense that beyond maybe what the Administration is proposing, which is merging OTS into the OCC, there isn't a view that there should be any further regulatory consolidation. So my question is, if we don't do that, then there still seems to be the opportunity for regulatory arbitrage where the regulated companies would choose what they believe to be the most lax regulator. So what mechanisms can we put in place to prevent that, to prevent the shopping? For example, the Administration's restrictions that are proposed on the ability of a troubled bank to switch charters, is that enough by themselves to prevent a regulatory arbitrage that we want? I would like to hear some of your ideas on that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I will start if that is OK. Congress has provided some mechanisms to contain regulatory arbitrage. A lot of restrictions that apply to national banks are made by Congress to apply to State banks if they are going to get Federal deposit insurance. That is an important backdrop, number one. Number two, the provision you just referred to, I think is an important one, and it is one on which the agencies have already tried to act. Actually I was going to tell the Chairman this--we had a break in your hearing in March during which Chairman Bair turned to me and said, you know, we have to figure out a way to do something about entities trying to get different charters when they are under enforcement actions or they see an enforcement action coming. And so she launched an initiative among the agencies to have us all reaffirm that charter conversion ought not to happen unless the institution is sound, there are no enforcement actions pending, and it is not being used to avoid supervisory ratings. A couple of the institutions shifting charters over the last several years that have become reasonably well known engaged in that sort of flight from enforcement. So I think this was a very important gap to plug.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Anything else? Is that enough?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think it is very important. We have seen over the years, a number of situations in which people have switched charters to avoid supervisory action. I totally support the action we have taken. If we wanted to go further and put some of that in legislative language, I would think that might be a very good idea, just to make sure that we don't change it in the future.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Chairman Bair.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I would agree with that, and we indicate that in our written testimony. We are the insurer. We are not the chartering entity. So, once deposit insurance is granted, if the entity then decides later to shift charities, we really don't have a role in that decision. We particularly feel that it is in our interest to ensure good, strong, robust prudential supervision. We do not want charter conversions to, in any way, be used to undermine that process. We would also be happy to work with you. Senator Reed and I had a conversation a while back about putting something like that in the statute to make sure the provision is there.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Well, I would join Senator Reed in that effort. Let me ask you, some big banks----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Senator Menendez, if I could address that question----","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Surely.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","----I think one of the charters, which I think is being used as an example of an arbitrage opportunity was the choice by Countrywide to move from regulation by the OCC and the Fed to regulation by the OTS. This was in March of 2007. In doing so, Countrywide brought approximately $92 billion in assets to the OTS. We undertook a very extensive coordination with the Fed, including the Fed Bank of San Francisco, the OCC, and others, as well as State regulators of various affiliates within the Fed's holding company jurisdiction. We granted the charter to Countrywide. But one of the facts that seemed to be sort of lost in a lot of the discussion is that 3 months or 4 months before Countrywide came to the OTS, Citibank took two historic thrift charters totaling approximately $232 billion in assets to the national bank charter from the Federal thrift charter shortly after Countrywide came. Cap One took approximately $17 billion in assets from a thrift charter to the OCC. I would suggest that the mere action of an entity, a business entity choosing to change its charter based upon its business plan in and of itself does not necessarily suggest that they fleeing a particular set of regulatory structures or whatever else.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","No, I appreciate that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","I just wanted to make myself clear on that point.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","I appreciate that. Let me ask the question, several big banks have come here and argued before the Committee that we shouldn't have a Consumer Financial Protection Agency because it is bad to separate safety and soundness regulations from consumer protection regulations. But that argue doesn't, at least to make, make much sense because safety and soundness regulations and consumer protection regulations are currently together in the same agencies and that very system failed miserably to protect middle-class American consumers. So if there is concern about regulators having overlapping responsibilities, can't that be solved by assigning clear responsibilities to each regulator and creating some solid procedures for resolving conflicts among regulators?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","On the consumer protection side, rulewriting traditionally has been divorced from enforcement, so the FDIC and the OCC have no power to write consumer rules. We examine and enforce, but we have never had rulewriting authority. That is separate already. So I think the bank regulators generally-- I do not want to speak for others--are supportive of this because the arbitrage, the choice, if you will, was not so much among bank charters, but between being a bank or being a nonbank. Mortgage brokers with very little regulation could originate loans without anybody looking over their shoulders, regarding undocumented income, or regressively marketing teaser-rate 2/28s and 3/27s. The value added with this new agency is providing rules across the board for both banks and nonbanks. And as we have all testified, keeping the examination and enforcement function with the bank regulators for the banks and having this new agency focus its examination and enforcement resources on the nonbank sector where there is not much oversight would give consumers protection across the board. So, whether they are dealing with a bank or a nonbank, they have some baseline level of protection and a regulator actually coming in and making sure those rules are being enforced and adhered to. Does that answer your question?","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Yes. Mr. Dugan, do you want to jump in?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I was just going to say I agree completely with everything Sheila just said, and attached to my testimony are examples of a number of the ways in which integrated safety and soundness and consumer protection supervision has found issues for both safety and soundness purposes and for consumer protection purposes that otherwise would not have been found under the current system. We believe that under the examination and supervision system currently in place, bank examiners are good at implementing rules that are written, and to the extent that a new agency writes strong rules, they will be complied with by banks through this function better than any other alternative model.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","So basically--and, Mr. Chairman, I will end on this. My understanding from the panel is that you are all in support of a consumer financial protection agency?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","No, Senator, that is not true. The Federal Reserve has not taken a position one way or another on the creation of the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Are you going to take a position?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","If we were specifically asked, I guess we would at least discuss among ourselves. I think our effort to this point has been to point out the virtues of integrated supervision and regulation of consumer products alongside the obvious virtues of a separate agency.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Menendez.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am very happy to see all of you here today. After you kissed the ring of the Secretary of the Treasury, you finally got out of the room, and you are here in person to testify, independently. It is really nice to see that. Mr. Tarullo, I want to go back to something that you said earlier. You said that the Fed would like to have the authority and the power to enforce. We gave you that 14 years ago--more than 14 years ago, actually. Now it is 15 or 16 years ago. And you did not write a regulation for 14 years to govern the banks that were under your control or the mortgage brokers that were under your control. I know you were not at the Fed. That is not the problem. The problem is the Fed had the ability to act and did not. So you might understand some of us not being agreeable to giving you more power when you failed in enforcing the power we gave you. So just for your information, you can take it back to Chairman Bernanke and the rest of the board and say, ``You know, it took you, Mr. Bernanke, 2 years after you became Chairman to write a regulation on mortgages. And it took Chairman Greenspan 12 years not to write it.'' So we are a little reluctant to give the Fed new additional authority. I just happen to agree with Chairman Bair on when the rubber hits the road, they are there to make something happen. Now, our panel is trying to figure out how to stop the rubber hitting the road--in other words, how to prevent systemic risk from becoming too big to fail. That seems to be the major problem. Senator Corker brought it up earlier today about, you know, we really need ideas, because we seem to have failed by not giving the authority to the right person or the right person not enforcing the authority we gave them. So my question to you is: What additional authority do you think we should give the Fed?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, as you know, I agree, personally--it is not a Board position--with you that the Fed took too long to use its existing authority to enact consumer protection associated with mortgages. I was referring a few moments ago-- and I will elaborate on it now--to the authority to provide consolidated supervision for any systemically important institution. As you know, a year-and-a-half ago, that statement would have, in practical terms, meant that a whole set of institutions--at that point, the five free-standing investment banks--would likely have been brought in by law to the consolidate supervision program. Because of the financial crisis, and the fact that a couple of those institutions are no longer with us and others have become bank holding companies, the immediate practical importance of the authority would not be as great as it would have been a year-and-a-half or 2 years ago. However, there is first the possibility that an institution which has become a bank holding company in the middle of the crisis, in an effort to get the imprimatur of having consolidated supervision, would, when things calm down, decide it does not so much like being a supervised entity, so it would dis-elect being a holding company.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","We could prevent that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","You could.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Absolutely. And, second, if in the future other institutions grow or activities migrate from the regulated sector to other institutions, we would want to make sure that any such institution which itself becomes systemically important would also be subject to consolidated supervision. That is what I referred to earlier.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Sheila, could you expound on the ability of the FDIC to preempt, in other words, to get in front of the foreclosure or the shutting down of our--in other words, looking prior to, with your regulatory regime into banks that you have under the FDIC jurisdiction? In other words, preventing.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think Congress gave the FDIC helpful new tools--they were finalized in early 2006--to make risk-based adjustments to our premiums that we charge for deposit insurance, because at least for insured depository institutions, this helps us provide economic disincentives to high-risk behavior. This is a tool we are using and will continue to further refine. But, it has been helpful, I think. I think the big problem or the shortcoming that we have found is that when these larger entities get into trouble, so much of the activity is outside the insured depository institution that our traditional resolution mechanism does not work. We can only resolve what is in the FDIC-insured institution, which is why we believe it would be very helpful to us, at the FDIC collectively, to get ahead of this. First of all, it would be a strong disincentive. We need more regulation, clearly, of these very large institutions, but we also need greater market discipline and the certainty that investors and creditors will take losses if an institution gets in trouble and would have come to the Government for help. They will be put into a resolution regime.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Let me ask you this simple question. If an entity is listed on an exchange, wouldn't the Securities and Exchange Commission have some kind of ability to examine all the aspects of that institution? I am looking at AIG, for instance.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, generally it is the holding company.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Correct. It is the holding company.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","It is the holding company, not the bank, that is listed. The SEC's regime is focused not on prudential supervision but on investor protection through a transparency regime. They do not do any kind of safety and soundness prudential oversight of listed companies. They are focused more on ensuring appropriate financial disclosure for the benefit of investors.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the panelists for being here today. An interesting discussion. I think we all agree that the gaps exist. I think we all agree that we still have not sealed those gaps up. And so I guess referring to the testimony from a gentleman on the second panel, a former Comptroller of the Currency, Mr. Ludwig, he writes and, in fact, recommends to ``streamline the current `alphabet soup' of regulators by creating a single world-class financial institution-specific regulator at the Federal level while retaining the dual banking system,'' which is very, very close to what, quite honestly, I have in mind. And he goes on to lay out a system of critiques, and you guys have somewhat addressed this in some of your other questions. But going back to what Senator Menendez asked in that he wanted to know if it could be laid out to seal these gaps by rulemaking or some other method, I am not sure I got an answer to that question. So I want you to share your thoughts as concisely as possible, because each one of you could burn 4 minutes and 50 seconds with one answer if you wanted. As to why significant reform in this direction is not the direction to go, taking off your hat as your individual department leaders--because I know turf does play a role. If somebody said, ``I am going to dissolve your farm,'' I would be a little upset with it. But just tell me how we can get these gaps closed without doing something like this and why this would not be a good idea. Go ahead, Sheila. We will just go down the line.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Again, I think the issue was not about the choice among bank charters. It was between being a bank or not being a bank and being much less regulated in the nonbanking sphere. I think that is the arbitrage that needs to be addressed.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","And what you are saying is that could not be addressed with one----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No, it would not, because you would just be consolidating what we all do for insured depository institutions. That would not expand beyond the already heavily regulated sector.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Could it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think with a systemic risk council it could, at least for risks that are systemic in nature. You would be able to give this new systemic risk council--which would also include the SEC and the CFTC--some ability to look across systems and to impose prudential requirements regarding capital and leverage where needed to mitigate systemic risk. And, yes, that would be across all sectors, not just for banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, I believe you could do more streamlining. You could move more in the direction you are talking about. We do not have an ideal system. But as my testimony suggests, there are some issues you are going to have to confront if you want to have an effective Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. If you go for long periods without having any bank failures, they are not going to have a lot to do and will not know the system very well if they do not supervise banks. Likewise, the Federal Reserve has some things to offer to supervision, particularly of the very largest institutions at the holding company level that are engaged in a lot of nonbanking activities. And to think that a banking supervisor would do all of that as well without having the benefit of direct supervision raises some questions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I would say, trying to be succinct, the two most important gaps to fill are: first, making sure that every systemically important institution does come within the perimeter of regulation; and, second, what we were discussing earlier, which is to say the assurance that there cannot be charter conversions motivated by efforts to escape enforcement and escape bad ratings. And just to be clear, I think it would be a perfectly good idea for the Congress to legislate on that matter so that in the unlikely event that our successors did not share the same view, they could not go in the opposite direction in which charter conversions could be done for the wrong reasons.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","I understand that, but what you are saying, then, a world-class financial institution, a specific regulator could work.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I actually think, as Sheila suggested early in the hearing, that what we have learned in this crisis is that there were lots of different models of supervision and regulation around the world, and none of them performed particularly well. And that seemed to me more of a lesson than anything about a particular structure or anything else. None of them performed particularly well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","And I would also pick up on the point, your concept is a world-class financial institution regulator. I think one of the lessons that we have learned--and Sheila has mentioned it a couple times--is that we have banks and nonbanks who are providing the same kinds of services in a different structure. If you are a financial institution, you do have world-class regulators currently. If you do not, you operate in a less than regulated or under-regulated environment. One of the suggestions I would have is that if you wanted to close that gap, there is a process by which you can do that. It starts with the CFPA, the Administration's proposal. The difficulty is how they carry out, how they enforce the regulations. The Administration proposes to use the CFPA as that. We suggest as bank regulators we can do it more effectively. But that is the start, because then you have to start looking at things like capital requirements, capital structure for those who are not financial institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Currently, have we made any progress, and not necessarily--well, I think ``we'' as a general group as well--towards regulation of derivatives, credit default swaps, those kinds of things? Or are we in the same boat we were in a year ago? Same boat, Mr. Bowman?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Yes. I would say that we are.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","OK. Everybody agree with that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes, and that does require legislation to fix.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Yes. OK. Are we concerned about that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I am. Yes, I think it is huge.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think it is very important.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Mr. Chairman, have you gotten any recommendations from any of these folks or anybody else on how we should be regulating derivatives and credit default swaps?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","What we are trying to do here is fashion, obviously, a piece of legislation that comprehensively deals with all of this, and the hope is we are going to do that when we get back in the fall. That is the purpose of these hearings, to bring these ideas together.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","But has anybody given you any concrete ideas or----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Oh, there have been all sorts of suggestions made on how to do it, clearinghouses and so forth. We have got a lot of recommendations.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","Well, I just think it is--as we move forward here, I can just real quickly----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","In fact, I would just say, John--and I will leave you more time--Senator Reed and Senator Bunning, in fact, are working on an idea that--in fact, a number of our colleagues here are working on various ideas to be part of the larger bill. The Subcommittee is working on it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Tester","I think it is good. It is somewhat distressing that, quite frankly, from my perspective--and I am not an expert in this field at all--we have a lot of people who are trying to do good work; but there are still gaps, and obvious gaps. And then at the banking level, we have got a myriad of regulators out there. Quite frankly, if I was a banker, I would be going crazy. I would. I would not know--I really would not know which person to be--knowing who I have to deal with, let us just put it that way, because we are coming at it from a lot of different angles. Then, you know, if you take into consideration--I think, Sheila, you said this. Community banks were not really a problem here, but yet they are getting pressed just as hard as anybody, from my perspective, as far as regulation goes. And I just think that this is an opportune time in the middle of a potential--not a potential--in the middle of a crisis to really take a lot at our regulation system and say let us simplify it, let us make it lean and mean and simplified. And I do not think that can happen unless we are willing to think outside the box and do things differently than we have done in the past. Thank you all for being here.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Ms. Bair, I wanted to ask you a few things that are little bit off topic but that are important, and that has to do with the recent actions of the Financial Accounting Standards Board with regard to bringing certain things that have been off balance sheet, on balance sheet, and what impacts that will have on institutions. How will FDIC treat the consolidation of previously off- balance-sheet entities? And, in particular, will the agency require additional capital for assets that are brought on balance sheet?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, yes, banks must follow U.S. GAAP. So if those are the accounting rules, if more assets are coming on balance sheet, capital levels are going to be impacted accordingly. Though we still have some concerns about the timing of all this, we support the general direction of bringing assets back on balance sheet. But the timing still gives me some heartburn--whether they really need to be on this accelerated framework. I think it also could be very damaging to efforts to get the securitization market back, because the way the rules are written now, as I understand, even if you just retain some portion of interest, the whole securitization might have to come back on balance sheet. That also goes at cross-purposes with our efforts to try to get originators to have some skin in the game. There are a lot of issues and questions we have about the timing, but we cannot control that. FASB is not an entity that we have any control over. We can file comment letters and that is about it. But banks must follow U.S. GAAP.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","So are the capital ratios set in law, or are they----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, yes. Prompt Corrective Action capital levels are set by statute, yes. There is not a lot of flexibility there.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","And so there is no flexibility for any phase-in period?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Not very much at all, no.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, traditionally the leverage ratio follows GAAP completely. The risk-based ratio has some variations, and at times has been more restrictive than GAAP. There also is some flexibility to look at this and phase it in over some time. This is an issue all the regulators are looking at now to try to address some of the issues that Chairman Bair just raised. The bottom line is this stuff is coming back on the balance sheet. Banks are going to have to hold capital against it. It is really a matter of timing and how it gets phased in.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","Well, I do not think anybody is arguing about the fundamental issue, but I am concerned with timing and phase-in because it could have negative consequences if it were, you know, here tomorrow overnight. So what is the current thinking about how that should be handled?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think the regulators are still discussing how this affects regulatory capital. The accounting rules become effective at the end of this year, beginning of next year, and how the regulatory capital rules respond is something that we will be discussing and providing some notice to the public shortly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","When do you think there will be fairly clear guidance for institutions about what to expect and what timetable and what phase-in, if you will?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","If I had to guess--and this is an interagency process--I would say weeks, not months.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","And I assume all of the agencies and regulators involved are in discussions about this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","It is an interagency rule, as capital requirements like this always are. So there will be a discussion among the agencies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","OK. Does anyone else have any comments about that?","Speech"," "
"Senator Vitter","OK. Thank you. That is all I have, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since Countrywide, was brought up, I just want to make sure I have got some facts right. It started off with a national bank subsidiary. You regulated the bank, Mr. Dugan, and the Fed regulated the holding company?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","That is correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And under your policy and case law, a subsidiary mortgage company, an affiliate mortgage company was not subject to California law.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","We regulated the bank, and it did a portion of its business inside the bank. It did most of its subprime lending outside the bank, not in the bank. The affiliate was subject to California law.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","It was subject to California law.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, but the bank itself was subject to the uniform Federal standards of the National Bank Act, and was not subject to California law. They did not do their subprime lending that caused a number of problems in the bank.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Just to be clear, the subprime lending was in an entity that was subject to California law.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Attorney General review, everyone else like that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","The Fed would have responsibility to review or inspect that mortgage company as an affiliate.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","At that time, before they switched charters, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Right. And did they do that, to your knowledge? Or what template did they use?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","You would have to ask the Federal Reserve. I will say, as in my testimony, that philosophically, historically, there has been this anomaly where the bank in a holding company gets very heavily inspected and regulated and is subject to the most intensive regulation, but the holding company affiliates were not subject to the same requirements for annual inspections. And that needs to be fixed, and the Federal Reserve has recently been doing more in that area, but it is not the same, and I believe it should be the same.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me switch to Mr. Bowman. When Countrywide came into your supervision, you were the holding company's supervisor, and you were also the bank's--the FSB, I presume.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And the company that did the bulk of the subprime was a California-regulated mortgage entity.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","There were a number of State-related affiliates within the holding company structure. I do not remember how many or how many States. I do not remember the percentage of California State versus New York versus other States.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","When you reviewed, your organization reviewed and inspected these holding companies, did you notice anything--did you inspect them or did you just inspect the FSB?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","We actually did a number of things. We spent a lot of time with both the Fed and the OCC, as I mentioned earlier, in previewing sort of what it was that was coming our way. We also convened shortly after granting the charter. Again, the charter was granted March of 2007. We convened what I would call a ``regulators conference,'' where we invited and, in fact, had regulators from many, many States--I do not remember the exact number--come in and discuss with us some of their particular concerns, if any, related to the operation of the affiliates within the holding company structure, including New York, California, and others.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And did that alert you to any potential problems?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Yes, it started to. Yes, it did, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","OK. Thank you. Let me switch gears. We had a few hearings ago Mr. Meltzer and Dr. Rivlin, who have a long-time association with the Federal Reserve. And their suggestion was that the Federal Reserve essentially get out of the business of supervising and regulating entities and concentrate on the issue of the monetary policy and perhaps, you know, other issues. My question is--and I will let you answer last, Governor. I think you have an opinion about this. But to the other panelists, if the Federal Reserve following this advice by two very knowledgeable people and experienced people, does not perform the role as the supervisor for large holding companies, who would or should? Do we have to create another entity? What is your general comment about that? Then I will conclude with the Governor.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","The Federal Reserve is the holding company supervisor for the vast majority, but not all of the very largest institutions. So, yes, I think you would have to create a new agency to do it if the Federal Reserve was not doing it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Dugan, do you have a comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I think you could put the holding company supervisor and the bank supervisor in the same entity. That is how the OTS works. You could do it. And I think, frankly, for smaller institutions and a lot of institutions where the only subsidiary of the company is the bank, there is some logic to that. But where you have companies, as was talked about earlier, where a lot of different businesses were engaged in nonbanking kinds of activities, that is where the particular expertise of the Fed--because of its closeness to the capital markets, its open market operations, its international central banking, all of that comes into play. Replicating that would be the most difficult challenge for any agency that tried to re- create it, either separately or inside a prudential supervisor.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Bowman--and quickly, because I have to give the Governor some----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Yes, I would agree with that. We currently regulate both the holding company underlying institution. I think you could replicate that. The difficulty would be in dealing with State-chartered organizations where you did not already have a Federal regulator like the OCC or the OTS.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Governor Tarullo, your comments, and I might just throw in one other issue. If the Fed is the regulator--and this is a common concern of all of you--you have to be able to sort of work through what is now the deference to functional regulators, which I think we have identified as a problem. So you might put that into your answer, too, Governor.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Senator. People are attracted-- particularly once they get out of Government or if they have never been in Government--to neat solutions that look great on paper. I think that anybody who has dealt with this crisis and, indeed, dealt with financial supervision on an ongoing basis, will tell you that the whole point about the financial sector of our economy is that it reaches everywhere and it affects everything. And if one is looking to a central bank to perform the dual mandate given to it by the Congress of trying to maximize employment and achieve price stability, I do not think there is any way to do that effectively without paying an awful lot of attention to financial stability. And to achieve financial stability, one has to have an influence upon the major kinds of financial activities in the economy, which are, of course, largely though not exclusively being performed by the larger institutions. So the interrelationship between monetary policy aims and the goals of financial stability really undergird the case for our central bank, and central banks around the world, being involved in supervision. That is point one. Point two, a graphic illustration of what can happen when the central bank is not closely involved in supervision was observed a couple of years ago in the United Kingdom following the decision to have a single financial services authority with all supervisory responsibility for all kinds of financial institutions. The Bank of England, the central bank, was not involved in supervision at all, and when a significant financial institution--Northern Rock--failed, the Bank of England was not in a position to be able to make judgments about the failure of Northern Rock or the ripple effects within the system. I think it is for that reason that you have a robust debate in the U.K. right now as to whether they need to return some supervisory authority to the Bank of England, I would assume, to coexist with the Financial Services Authority. Now, there have been some proposals to put everything back in the Bank of England. I personally would not think that would be a particularly good idea. You raised the question, and let me just address briefly, the issue of ability to get information and to enforce where necessary. I think it is important, if you are going to ask an entity to perform a role of consolidated supervision, to make sure that they have the tools to do so. Now, as it happens right now there is--and I have no reason to expect there will not be--quite a good relationship between the Fed and the Comptroller with respect to banks within holding companies. But we need to make sure that some kinds of information that are not gathered in bank supervision or, for that matter, certainly supervision of other kinds of regulated entities--insurance entities or securities entities--can, if necessary, be obtained in order to provide the kind of supervisory oversight of the whole institution that you are asking about or looking for. I do not personally anticipate that there is going to be much utilization of such an authority, but I think you do have to have that kind of back-up.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I have gone way over my time and I----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Just very quickly----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I am abusing the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Just if I could very quickly respond, just to that last point. On the functional regulator point, it may go too far the way it is now, but the way the Administration has proposed it has pushed it too far in the other direction so that you could override the authority of the primary supervisor and that is too much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Pointed noted. Thank you, my colleagues.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to all of you and thank you for being here. I want to ask a question about the proposal of the Administration regarding the elimination of restrictions to interstate banking for national and State banks. I know that a lot of community bankers in Florida would be greatly concerned about that and I wonder if aggressive branching didn't contribute to excessive risk taking in a desire to increase market share, which, in fact, may have had a lot to do with a lot of the problems we have seen lately. So would a limit on branch banking, how would it change the competitive landscape? Madam Chair?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Senator, the FDIC has not taken a position on that particular provision. I do know that there are several community bankers that are concerned about it, but I am sorry, we don't have a corporate position on it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","Does anyone else care to comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I do not think it would be a good idea to reimpose limits on interstate branching. Right now, there are some limits left on the first branch into a State. But basically, the decades-long restrictions gradually evolved over the years to permit interstate branching and I think it did permit more diversification geographically which was helpful in some circumstances. I personally would not be in favor of further limits.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","Any other thoughts on the matter? I guess----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I would just say, Senator, that you alluded to circumstances in which interstate operations became a problem, and I think that can be the case. But that is where it is important to focus upon the business model of the entity in question. It ought not to be allowed to engage in unsafe and unsound practices, whether they involve excessive branching that is unsupported by a sound business plan or other practices.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","I would just simply point out the fact that thrifts do currently enjoy the ability to branch interstate without restriction, and in terms of the impact upon the community banks, my impression has been that that privilege that thrifts currently enjoy has had some impact, but I am not certain how great.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","My colleague from Montana brought up the testimony that we have in writing from Mr. Ludwig, and I wanted to go into another area of his testimony that I found very interesting. He makes the point, and I am sure he could make it much better than I if he were making it, which he may get a chance to do later, but that he would suggest avoiding a two- tier regulatory system that elevates the largest ``too-big-to- fail'' institutions over smaller institutions, and he makes the point that perhaps there would be also two-tier regulators, the best regulators in one system, the others in another, and so anyway, he would urge not to create a ``too-big-to-fail'' category because it would, in fact, be contrary to what he thinks would be the best interest of not creating a bias in the system that would be in favor of those institutions considered too big to fail at the expense of those that were not viewed too big to fail. Again, could I just get a comment from each of you on that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think there are a couple of questions there. One is whether there should be so-called ``Tier 1'' entities that are officially designated as too-big-to-fail, regardless of who regulates them. There may be some combination of OCC and Federal Reserve Board oversight. And second, whether, as part of regulatory consolidation, you want to have a regulator based on size as opposed to charter. I think on the former, we have some concerns about designating institutions formally as Tier 1. I think you can probably say who is not, based on asset size--who may not be systemic. But I think to have a clear line of who is systemically important, does contribute to moral hazard. Especially if you don't have a resolution mechanism, it would be quite problematic. But I do believe the assumption is to have stronger capital and leverage constraints for those very large institutions than for the smaller institutions. In terms of bank regulation, unlike consolidated holding company supervision, I think you should maintain a Federal charter and a State charter. That generally breaks out along size lines, but not always. We have some fairly large State- chartered entities. The OCC has many community banks, as well. But the charter choice, I think, is good to maintain--not different regulatory policies, but policies that are perhaps more reflective of local conditions. With State charters, I think having some sensitivity and more immediacy of being able to deal with a State-level banking supervisor is helpful. So I would maintain regulation based on State or Federal chartering as opposed to employing size limitations.","Speech"," "
"Senator Martinez","I know we have a vote and I don't know how much time we have left, so I will leave it at that, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I wanted to start by asking, Governor, it is my understanding that some of the problems at Citigroup and other major institutions resulted from moving risky activities back and forth between the holding company and the national bank to minimize supervision. So my question is whether by creating a similar structure, but instead of the Fed and the OCC it would be the Fed and the NBS, National Bank Supervisor, whether we are creating the same risk in the new system of moving activities back and forth.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think under any approach, you must have a common set of requirements across the system which minimize the opportunities for regulatory arbitrage. That means within institutions, and it also means between regulated institutions and nonregulated institutions. I would say, without talking about any specific institution, there certainly were circumstances in which institutions may have taken advantage of different applicable capital requirements, or of bundling things in one form and moving them around the entity and that part of what needs to be done is to take regulatory steps that minimize those opportunities. Senator Vitter was asking earlier about bringing off- balance sheet assets back onto the balance sheet. That is one way to combat regulatory arbitrage.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Well, let me just ask this. Do you think it would make more sense to have the holding companies and the banks under the same regulatory agency?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I don't, actually. Now, with respect to smaller holding companies, particularly those that have only a bank--it is basically a shell and there is a bank, there are no other entities--the amount of additional holding company supervision is actually quite modest. As the bank holding company picks up additional activities--if it does any of its own capital raising, if it has even a small additional subsidiary, if it does some management at the holding company level--that is when an independent scrutiny of those activities seems to me valuable. As you get to an even bigger institution, an even more complex institution, it does seem as though the task becomes more specialized because you are now looking not just at immediate impacts on the bank--although that is important because we want to protect the deposit insurance fund--you now, as we have learned in this crisis, also need to examine how the whole entity, can be creating risk in and of itself. That involves different kinds of activities, different kinds of regulated entities that are, as you say, moving things back and forth or acting in parallel, and that is where I think you do need a different approach which looks at the holding company as an integrated whole, supplementing and complementing the rigorous functional regulation that takes place in the subsidiaries.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Yes. Please be very quick, because I want to get in my second question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","OK, I will. I would say the one area, as I mentioned earlier. I do think there are times where there are activities going on in the bank and the holding company that are the same types of activities but they are subject to different levels of supervision. We ought to try to fix that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I would just say two things. We have suggested in prior testimony that large institutions have their own resolution plans so that they could be liquidated very quickly if they got into trouble and that a key to this would be greater legal separateness of the insured depository institution and what is in the insured depository institution versus what is not. Our resolution process is very complicated now with these large institutions because of the interrelationships between the bank and the nonbank activities. It is hard--you are right--to sometimes tell the difference. There is a provision called 23(a), which is designed to protect banks from being used as sources of strength for the holding company. We are consulted by the Federal Reserve Board regarding requests for exceptions to the 23(a) restrictions. However, the Fed has the sole authority to approve these requests that can move more higher-risk assets into banks where they are funded with insured deposits. So in terms of an incremental step, and I think that this is no surprise to the Federal Reserve Board, we would very much like to have a statutory role in the 23(a) approval process because this does increase our exposure.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me interrupt here. I want to make sure I get Senator Bennett in before the vote.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Not at all, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I thank you very much, Senator Merkley. We will leave the record open for further questions, by the way, for all of you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much. Probably, given the time, this will be more of a statement that you can ponder than questions that I want answers to, but I would like to get some answers later on. It will come as no surprise that I want to talk about ILCs, and no one has discussed the ILC charter in their written testimony. Let us point out that the growth of ILCs over the last 20 years has been one of the great successes in the financial services markets. They are the best capitalized and safest banks in the country. They were in no part a contributor to the financial crisis. They provide credit in places that it has not been available before, niche markets, a diverse set of products, and the Administration's proposal says, let us eliminate them. Now, I find that incredible, that something--we talk about Conseco, Lehman Brothers, CIT. All had ILCs, and as they were wound down, the ILCs were the assets that were the crown jewels. The ILCs were the assets that had the most value. And yet the proposal is, let us eliminate them. Let us eliminate the charter. Now, Mr. Tarullo, you made a comment that the center of this crisis is too big to fail and much of this discussion has been in that area of ``too big to fail.'' May I respectfully suggest that the center of the crisis is not ``too big to fail.'' ``Too big to fail'' is a manifestation that came out of the center of the crisis, and to put it in my very much layman's terms, the crisis was caused because of this game of musical chairs with respect to risk. And we built more and more risk into the system because while the music was playing, more and more institutions passed the risk on to somebody else thinking, to use the phrase that Sheila used, I have no skin in this game anymore, this game being this particular instrument. And you go with the change. It starts with the borrower. He has no risk whatsoever because there is no equity in the house. He is getting a 100 percent loan. Sometimes it is a liar loan. The broker who arranges the loan has no risk in the game because he passes it on to the lender. The lender has no risk in the game because he passes it on to the GSE. The GSE has no risk because with the rating agency that has no risk has rated it, and he can pass it on, securitize it, to somebody else. And at every step in the way, in the path, somebody makes money, on a fee, on a commission, whatever it might be. And when the music stops, it turns out that everybody had risk in the game because the whole thing collapses. And I would like to know a regulator who can focus on that question, not how big you are, but where are you in this chain of musical passing on of risk, musical chairs, if you will, that says somebody can say, no more loans in the beginning. No more liar loans. To brokers, no, you can't pass this on. You have to have some kind of a risk if you get involved in brokering this loan so you will then by market pressure do your job better to see to it that you don't pass it on. To the lender, you maintain some kind of risk as the chain goes forward. The GSE, you maintain some kind of risk. The rating agencies, you will get a risk. But no one had any risk and the bubble, therefore, grew and grew and grew because everybody was making money with no exposure. And that is the problem that I want to solve with this restructuring rather than working around some of the turf battles that we have talked about. Now I will go save the republic and you can respond to","Speech"," "
"Chairman Warner"," Senator Warner . Does anybody want to respond?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I would just say a word, Senator, since this will be recorded. I actually agree with everything Senator Bennett said, except I think too-big-to-fail actually plays exactly into the narrative that he gave us. He was talking about the GSEs which were the biggest institutions of all that in the end were regarded ``too big to fail?'' It was the GSEs. It is not the only problem, but I think it is a very important problem. I should be careful about speaking for people on the panel, but certainly making sure that risks are properly assessed by entities--and I would add, making sure that compensation systems and entities accurately reflect the risk that employees are assuming--are important pieces of a reform package.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I will just say, speaking for myself, I would agree that I don't to eliminate the ability to choose a State charter instead of a Federal charter, including an ILC charter. We don't think this was a driver or a contributor to this crisis. We were unaware that the Administration was going to propose that. But again, speaking for myself, I don't see that the ILCs were in any significant way involved in what was going on.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you. Let me go ahead and ask my question and then I will call on Senator Schumer. Thank you,","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer"," I want to go back to where Chairman Dodd started and Senator Tester went with his direction. I am still struggling with this question of whether we do a single end-to-end depository regulator. I think some of you all have raised some legitimate concerns. I know folks on the second panel will perhaps have a different view. Paul Volcker has got a different view. Past chairs have had a different view. I think, Chairman Bair, your point was valid. How do you make sure that you don't infringe upon your insurance function? I do think you could achieve that by having backup authority and your ability to continue to go in and check particularly those institutions that got into trouble, to check on your ongoing role both as an insurer and what Senator Corker and I have talked about, an expanded resolution authority. I also tend to think that the notion of an enhanced Systemic Risk Council that would include the Fed, that would include the Treasury, that would include the FDIC and this end-to-end bank regulator as well as the SEC and others would give you that ability to have those variety of voices heard. And I would also just want to raise one other point that we have talked a lot this morning about, the chartering and the ability to change charters, and perhaps prohibiting that. I think you all have raised appropriately those questions. But since each of your organizations have had a licensing division, there is also the question of a selection of a charter when you start an institution. I guess my first question would be, having that very nature of that choice at the beginning, not switching midstream, but that selection choice at the beginning, doesn't that create regulatory arbitrage? Don't you by default find out who is going to offer you the best deal on the front end and go to that, within your respective agencies, that licensing operation? Doesn't that create the arbitrage issue?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, first, Senator, Sheila and I don't have any authority to charter institutions. The banks we supervise are State chartered. I would say, though, that--and she can respond to this better than I--because we have similar regulatory requirements----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","If we could do it fairly quickly, because I do have another question I want to ask----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Sure. Some of the regulatory requirements are for all institutions and the FDIC has to decide whether to grant insurance to each depository institution, no matter by whom chartered, that wants to be insured. There is a way to contain that kind of arbitrage while permitting the useful, innovative kinds of experimentation that States have engaged in, such as allowing creation of NOW accounts, for example.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Dugan, Mr. Bowman, do you want to----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I would agree. We do have a licensing function and I would just say that just because you have a choice when you begin operating, it is not necessarily arbitrage. There are differences that go along with the charters in terms of what banks can do and how they can do it, and some prefer to have local, State Government regulation even though we have local examiners on the ground. There is a choice, but the FDIC does grant deposit insurance to all of them. I don't think that is where the arbitrage issue that we have confronted most has been. It has been after banks have been in operation where someone is facing a problem and they seek to change their charter to avoid a downgrade or an enforcement action. That is the thing that I think troubles all of us a great deal.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Bowman.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Yes, I would agree with that. I mean, in terms of people choosing a charter at the outset, the thrift charter is somewhat unique in terms of some of the limitations that are placed upon the kinds of business that an entity would want to engage in. Our thought is that people choose a charter based upon their business plan. In terms of others who are attempting to switch charters because of some perceived favorable difference between, say, a State charter and a Federal charter, within the State charters you have got 50 to choose from, or 52 to choose from. The Federal charter, you have two, the Federal thrift charter and the national bank charter. Anyone who is looking to avoid or evade some kind of supervisory action or enforcement action, I think as we have talked about here, we as a collective group, interagency basis, have tried to take steps to avoid that from happening or to slow it down, to make sure that it doesn't happen for the wrong reasons.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","One common theme from all of you has been-- and I think accurately--reflecting that a great deal of the source of the crisis has come from the nonbank financial sector. Another issue I am struggling with and would like to get all of your comments on is, assume whichever way, consolidating a single entity or maintaining the current structure, how do we get our arms around this nonbank financial arena? Clearly, one approach the Administration has talked about is on the consumer end, the consumer product end, looking at specific financial products coming from this array of institutions. Another is that if they kind of bump up to the level of becoming systemically risky, the Council, or in the Administration's proposal the Fed would have oversight. What I am not clear on is should these nonbank--this nonbank financial sector have some level of day-to-day prudential regulation, and I have not seen anybody propose where that--one, is it needed, and two, where that day-to-day prudential regulation in terms of safety and soundness would land. Comments?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","You have prudential supervision of banks because of deposit insurance and other vehicles as part of the safety net. With the nonbanks, you do not have that. They are not federally insured.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Should you have some?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I don't think you need to. I don't think you need to go that far. I think the consumer abuses for the smaller entities were really more of a significant driver, the lax underwriting which then spilled over into the larger institutions because of the competitive situation it created. But no, I don't think you do. I think if you have the ability to impose prudential requirements on systemic institutions or systemic practices, then I don't think you need institutional----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","So the Council up here for systemic and the consumer down here, but no need for----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","I generally think that is a daunting challenge to regulate the hundreds of thousands of different financial providers all on a safety and soundness basis. But I think the Administration would do so and have the authority to do so for consumer protection, as you suggested. It doesn't get at what really is, and was, a fundamental issue. To the extent they engage in very banklike functions and there is a safety and soundness issue, like an underwriting standard or downpayment requirements, I would argue that is not really a consumer protection function in its traditional sense----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","It almost goes to some of the comments Senator Bennett was making about making sure you have got skin in the game----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes. That is the consumer having skin in the game. But my point is, part of the mortgage legislation that passed the House last year had some common standards that I would say are prudential standards that apply. I think that would have been helpful for mortgage providers, but not necessarily all financial providers. So I think there may be some instances where some of that is warranted.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","But wouldn't Senator Bennett's approach, that if you originated a product, then you have to keep it in there, that is not so much just protecting the consumer, but it may be also protecting this--putting some requirements of safety and soundness on the institution----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","----quasi-prudential.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I would say a couple of things. First, I do think that the question of where regulation stops, how broadly the perimeter is cast, is an important one going forward. We know that we are not going to have the same problems as we had a few years ago. There are going to be new problems, and that, I think, is what everybody is addressing. How do we stop it? I would have thought that one of the important roles of a Council, of some sort of an interagency council, is precisely to attend to issues that don't seem under anybody's regulatory umbrella at that particular moment. If----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Beyond just being whether they are systemically risky, down to----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think you point out the problem. You have systemically risky institutions addressed, you have regulated institutions that are already regulated, and then you have consumer. But if you have a practice which is troublesome, then there ought to be a mechanism for somebody to be making an evaluation of that practice. And then perhaps if the Council saw that one of its members had authority to regulate, it could suggest it. Congress could also think about giving some sort of default or back-up authority to the Council in the event that no one had----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Very quickly, because the senior Senator from New York is anxious.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","I think, Senator, that you really have hit the nub of the issue, which is the ability to regulate or somehow oversee this group in between the Council and the CFPA. Trust me that whatever scheme might be brought up or passed into legislation, there are very, very creative people out there who are going to look at that legislation, the regulations that are drafted by it and they are going to find a way to get around it, whether it is at the State level, the Federal level, whatever else. People create businesses every day. They have a business model of where they want to engage in a particular activity. I think the preference for a lot of people is to engage in a particular activity with a minimum of regulation attached to it. So it is a very, very difficult issue.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Senator Schumer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank all of you for being here, very important subject. We have all gathered here today with one common goal, to make our financial regulatory system strong enough to prevent another severe financial crisis from happening. And I have read the written testimony. If I were in your shoes, I would probably make the same arguments. But some might argue there is a bit of turf protection here. That is natural, but it shouldn't be the dominant consideration as we move forward. Mr. Bowman, in all due respect, almost everyone regards the OTS as having failed in its responsibilities. We have seen institution after institution after institution poorly regulated, and you are saying, keep the OTS. So I think even though, probably again, if I were sitting where you were, with hard-working men and women working for you, I would say, keep my agency, keep all the powers, don't do any consolidation, I think we in the Committee have to see the testimony as coming from at least partially that perspective. So I would ask you this. There are reasons for one strong, powerful, efficient regulator, and I think people who are objective, who don't have any turf considerations, when they look up from on high, tend to think that should happen in the banking area. There is more discussion in the Systemic Risk Regulator. I think there is a good argument that the insurer should be separate from the regulator because there are different concerns. So let me ask you this, though, all of you. Here are four arguments for a consolidated regulator. One is that a consolidated regulator would prevent charter shopping, so a bank can't flip its charter and pick up its own regulator-- Countrywide did that, remember that, Mr. Bowman? A hodgepodge of different regulators adds to conflicts in regulation and creates confusing burdens for the banks. We have all heard from institutions who were told one thing by one regulator and another thing by another regulator, each of whom has authority. Third, a single regulator could keep better tabs of industry-wide risks, dangers, and developments. That is pretty apparent. And fourth, a single consolidated regulator can eliminate agency and regulatory arbitrage and gaps, and no bank could escape from being held accountable for violations or poor practices. So my question to you is, do you disagree that one consolidated regulator would avoid these four problems, or have these four benefits, even if you think other mechanisms might be better for other reasons? Who wants to go first?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I will start, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I would say that each of the four things you mentioned is an important aim. Some of them, like avoiding charter conversion arbitrage, can be addressed short of a single regulator. That is one thing that the four of us at this table have tried to do already. The only thing I would add to what you say is there are also some costs to going the single regulator route. So one of the costs is that the Fed, for example, loses some insight into how banks are actually functioning, how they are moving money, why the volatility of money is what it is. I think, also, another potential cost is you have a single all-encompassing regulator and sometimes it loses perspective because it is the only game in town----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Right. Look, I wouldn't deny there are arguments on the other side, but you would agree that these four arguments make some sense for a consolidated regulator?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Right. I think a couple of them are stronger than others, but yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Mr. Dugan is shaking his head. You agree?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, I would agree with that. Those benefits are definitely there and real, I think. This is the right equation. You have to ask, what are the costs, and again, I think there are certain things that the Federal Reserve brings to the table in terms of closeness to the markets and expertise from the open market operations that would be difficult, but not impossible, to replicate, but that are real, and you have to consider that. And second, as I have mentioned earlier with my colleague for the FDIC, it is hard to be----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Dugan","----good at it if you are not doing it all the time, and so you have to take those things into account.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Ms. Bair.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes. I think on the monitoring, if you look at the jurisdictions that had a single regulator, they really weren't any better. If you have a single monopoly regulator, that can contribute to regulatory laxity as opposed to having competition among regulators. Also, regarding regulatory arbitrage it is not just a matter of picking bank charters. If you don't include securities firms, derivatives dealers, hedge funds, and insurance companies, you still have the ability to choose a business model, on a legal model that would fall outside of the existing regulatory regime. So unless you include all of the various types of financial firms, I think you are going to still have some degree of arbitrage.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Right. Mr. Bowman.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Yes, Senator Schumer. I would agree that the single form of regulator really hasn't proven to be any more effective in terms of what we have now. And I would also be remiss to point if I did not point out that since 2008, 79 financial institutions, State chartered financial institutions have failed----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","----15 national banks, and 11 thrifts. I think I also need to point out that OTS chartered Countrywide in March of 2007. We had the market impact in August of 2007, and 5 months later, Countrywide was sold to Bank of America. The ability of we as the regulator to impact the events at Countrywide in a 10-month period was very, very limited.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK. I have another question if I might, Mr. Chairman, and this relates to the point Mr. Bowman just made. As you said, 54 out of the 69 banks that have failed this year were State chartered banks. This one thing, I mean, I guess it is a historical anomaly, but why the Fed supervises State chartered banks and Mr. Dugan supervises federally chartered banks. I mean, when I first got to the Banking Committee in 1981, I didn't understand that. It just sort of happened, I guess. And so let me ask both, first Mr. Tarullo, it is true that most of this year's failed banks were not regulated by the national supervisor, the OCC, or the national thrift supervisor, OTS. Explain to me--and then Ms. Bair could answer, as well--could you explain to me why the FDIC and the Fed should keep State chartered banking supervision, particularly if we are giving the Fed more responsibilities in other areas? If you think those functions should be kept apart from the proposed National Bank Supervisor, why shouldn't we at the very least merge FDIC and Fed supervision of the State chartered banks, if you are not going to have the same supervisor? Mr. Tarullo.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Excuse me. Could I just, Senator Schumer, just ask the panel all to try to answer quickly because we do want to try to get the second panel, at least get their statements in.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","You know what, I will ask unanimous consent that each panelist be asked to answer that question in writing, because I didn't realize we had a second panel and I was the last one here. Thanks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","It looks like we are going to have to reschedule the second panel, so I am anxious for you all to respond to Senator Schumer's question.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Mr. Chairman, I am deeply grateful.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I would start by saying, as you noted, the national banks would be supervised by the OCC as well as chartered. State banks that are members of the Federal Reserve System are supervised by the Fed as their Federal supervisors, and if they are nonmember banks, then their primary Federal regulator is the FDIC. I think that there are two answers to the question. One is, as you suggest, history. The Comptroller was started in 1863 to create a new national charter and we have had a dual banking system ever since. I think there is probably some concern on the part of State Banking Commissioners that they not have as their overseer at the Federal level the same entity that charters national banks----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","That is a little bit of what we would say in Brooklyn is turf.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","It is, there is no question. But I think their concern is, Senator, whether or not there would be the same kind of treatment of national and State chartered institutions. Second, the question is, are there gains from having the FDIC and the Fed supervising banks as well as performing their other functions, and I would suggest that there are.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I would want to comment on the previous statement that 54 of the 69 banks were State-chartered. There are a lot more State-chartered banks, and a lot of these are very, very small institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","A lot of the biggest failures were under not Mr. Bowman, I don't blame him, but his predecessor's watch.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","We also have provided a lot of support for the larger institutions, as well, on an open bank basis. So I think that all needs to be taken into account. I do think--Senator, I know it is confusing that we have these multiple regulators and it is frustrating because it is hard to explain to the public. On the other hand, as a deposit insurer, we find it extremely helpful to have people on the ground in banks all the time. It helps us a lot. It gives us a window into seeing what is going on in banking, what emerging risks there might be. You are right, we could perhaps pick some of that up through a backup supervisory process, but I think if we were going to shift to that model, give up primary regulation of State chartered banks and go up just to that, we would have to be much more robust and on-site with our backup examination to keep those data points continually into our risk assessment of what our risks are. So that would, in turn, add to regulatory burden. So I think that supervisor perspective we get by regulating State-chartered banks is very helpful to us in our insurance function.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Senator, if I could just add to the confusion, as you know, the OTS is the back-up regulator for State chartered savings associations, so you have a Federal regulator regulating the same charter at the State level.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I would like to thank the panel for a very interesting morning and one that has been very helpful, I know, to all the Members. I want to also apologize to the next panel, Mr. Ludwig, Mr. Carnell, and Mr. Baily. I understand staff will be back to you about rescheduling. We do want to hear your views. I know some of the second panel views perhaps were more sympathetic to the single end-to-end depository regulator and we want to make sure we get those views on the record and get a chance to press questions, as well. But thank you very much of the first panel and we will reschedule the second. The hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Let me inform my colleagues here, my good friend, Richard Shelby, is stuck in an airport in Birmingham trying to get back, and so I left a message for him that when he arrives about 10 or 11 this evening, that Senator Corker will call him and read him the entire testimony today. He would like that. He would appreciate that.","Statement","OPENING STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN CHRISTOPHER J. DODD"
"Chairman Dodd","So what we will do here is I will make a few opening comments and I will ask if either of my colleagues would like to be heard at all and we will get right to our witnesses. We thank them for joining us here today in this hearing on ``Prudential Bank Regulation: Should There Be Further Consolidation?'' I know we have had a lot of informal conversations with each other over many, many months on this subject and many others related to the reform of the financial regulatory structure. As I have said over and over again, while I think some of us are getting closer to firmer ideas, I believe most of us here are still very anxious to hear from people who bring a particular knowledge and expertise, as our witnesses do here today, on this subject matter. So we are interested in your thoughts. We all understand here how important this subject matter is. We also understand how important it is that we do it right and that we realize we are doing things here that have not been done in years, and so as we chart forward, we want to make sure that we are doing so carefully and thoughtfully. So while I know there are those who are impatient, that while we haven't answered all the questions, even though the problems that emerged a year ago have not been entirely solved, I think it is important that we do it carefully and right, and that is our determination on this Committee. This afternoon, we will have a chance to hear from four very knowledgeable witnesses on the subject matter. I have read all of your testimony. I think it has been tremendously helpful. I think you go beyond, in some cases, talking about the single prudential regulator or the consolidation of regulation to other areas, as well, so while we are talking about that subject matter, certainly my colleagues don't need any advice from me on the subject matter, but clearly, the expertise is at this table. We would invite questions regarding a wide subject matter, in addition to the one that is the title of the hearing today. So with that, this afternoon we examine how best to ensure the strength and security of our banking system. I would like to thank our witnesses again for returning to share your expertise after the last hearing was postponed. Today, we have a convoluted system of bank regulators created by an almost historical accident. I think most experts would agree that no one would have designed a system that worked like this. For over 60 years, Administrations of both political parties, Members of Congress across the political spectrum, commissions, and scholars have proposed streamlining this irrational system. Last week, I suggested further consolidation of bank regulators would make a lot of sense. We could combine the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision while transferring bank supervision authorities from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve and leaving them to focus on their core functions. Since that time, I have heard from many who have argued that I should not push for a single bank regulator. The most common argument is not that it is a bad idea, but rather, consolidation is too politically difficult to achieve. That argument doesn't work terribly well with me, nor, I suspect, with many, if not most, of my colleagues. Just look what the status quo has given us. In the last year, some of our largest banks needed billions of dollars of taxpayer money to prop them up and dozens of smaller banks have failed outright. It is clear that we need to end charter shopping, where institutions look around for the regulator that will go easiest on them. It is clear that we must eliminate the overlaps, redundancies, and additional red tape created by the current alphabet soup of regulators. We don't need a super- regulator with many missions, but a single Federal bank regulator whose sole focus is the safe and sound operation of our Nation's banks. A single operator would ensure accountability and end, I think, the frustrating ``pass the bucket'' excuses that we have been faced with over these many, many months. We need to preserve our dual banking system, and I feel just as strongly about that point as I do the earlier point. State banks have been a source of innovation and a source of strength, tremendous strength, in our communities. A single bank regulator can work, I think, with the 50 State bank regulators. Any plan to consolidate bank regulations would have to ensure community banks are created appropriately. Community banks did not cause the crisis and they should not have to bear the cost or burden of increased regulation necessitated by others. Regulation should be based on risk. Community banks do not present the same type of supervisory challenges that large counterparts do. But we need to get this right, as I said a moment ago, which is why you are all here today. I am working again with Senator Shelby and other Members of the Committee and colleagues here to find a consensus that we can craft on this incredibly important bill. So with that, unless one of my other colleagues wants to be heard for a few minutes on opening up, I will turn to our witnesses. Our first witness--and I will introduce all of them briefly here--Eugene Ludwig, is the Chief Executive Officer of the Promontory Financial Group. Before assuming that responsibility, Gene served as the Vice Chairman and Senior Control Officer of Bankers Trust Corporation, which he joined in 1998. He served as the Comptroller of the Currency from 1993 to 1998, and prior to joining the OCC, was a partner in the law firm of Covington and Burling. Martin Baily is a Senior Fellow for Economics at the Brookings Institution. Dr. Baily also serves as the Cochair of the Pew Task Force on Financial Sector Reform and is a senior advisor to McKinsey and Company. He served as Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors under the Clinton administration from 1999 to 2001, and prior to that was a member of the same Council from 1994 to 1996. Richard Carnell is an Associate Professor at the Fordham University School of Law. He previously served as the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Treasury from 1993 to 1999. And prior to that, Mr. Carnell was also a Senior Counsel to this very Committee, from 1989 to 1993. Richard Hillman is the Managing Director of the Financial Markets and Community Investment Team of the U.S. Government Accountability Office. He has been with GAO for 31 years and his team looks at the effectiveness of regulatory oversight in the financial and housing markets and the management of community development programs. We are honored that all four of you are with us today. We thank you for your service, your past service, and your willingness to participate in today's conversation. All of you have been before this Committee many times in the past and I will not limit you in a strict fashion to the time, but if you would try to keep it in that 5 to 7 minutes-- and I know your testimony goes on longer than that, and the testimony, the full testimony and comments and supporting data, we will include as part of the record, as well. Gene, we welcome you back to this Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Chairman Dodd, and to Ranking Member Shelby, who is not here, and other distinguished Members of this Committee, I am honored to be here today and I want to commend you and the staff for the thoughtful way in which you have examined the causes of the financial crisis and the need for reform in this area. Under your leadership, Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby, the bipartisan and productive traditions of the Senate Banking Committee have continued. In this regard, it should be noted that the need for an end-to-end independent consolidated banking regulator, the subject you have asked me to address today, has been championed over the years by Members of the Senate Banking Committee, including its Chairman, as well as Treasury Secretaries from both sides of the aisle. Consistent with this tradition, the Administration's white paper is directionally helpful and commendable. While refinements to the white paper are needed, this is an inevitable part of the policymaking process. I also want to commend the Treasury Department of former Secretary Henry Paulson for having developed its so-called ``Blueprint,'' which also has added important and positive developments to the debate in this area. Lamentably, the financial regulatory problem we face is not just the current crisis. Over the past 20-plus years, we have witnessed the failure of hundreds of U.S. banks and bank holding companies, supervised by every one of our regulatory agencies. By the end of this year alone, well over 100 U.S. banks will have failed, costing the Deposit Insurance Fund tens of billions of dollars. Before this crisis is over, we will witness the failure of hundreds more. In the face of this irrefutable evidence, it is impossible to say there is not a very serious problem with our regulation of financial services organizations. There are three things, however, this problem is not. It is not about the lack of talented people in our regulatory agencies. It is not about weak regulation or weaker bankers. The problem is in large part--the problem stems from a dysfunctional regulatory structure, a structure that exists nowhere else in the world and no one wants to copy, a structure that reflects history, not deliberation. The recent financial crisis has accentuated many of the shortcomings of the current regulatory system. Needless burdens that weaken safety and soundness focus, lack of scale needed to address problems in technical areas, regulatory arbitrage where the ability to select or threaten to select a weaker supervisor tears at the fabric of solid regulation, delayed rulemaking, regulatory gaps, limitations on investigations, where one agency cannot seamlessly examine and resolve a problem from a bank to its nonbank affiliate, and diminished international leadership. What is needed and what would resolve these problems is an end-to-end independent consolidated banking supervisor. Now, there have been a number of misconceptions about what a consolidated end-to-end institutional bank regulator is and what it is not. First, an end-to-end supervisor is not a super- regulator along the lines of Britain's FSA. The end-to-end consolidated institutional supervisor would not regulate financial markets like the FSA, would not establish consumer protection rules like the FSA, would not have resolution authority, would not have deposit insurance authority or any central banking functions. The consolidated end-to-end institutional regulator would focus only on the prudential issues applicable to financial institutions, and this model has been quite successful elsewhere in the world. I think this is really quite important. For example, the Office of the Superintendent of Financial Institutions, OSFI, in Canada, and the Australian Prudential Regulatory Authority, called APRA, in Australia have been quite successful consolidated supervisors even in the current crisis, where Canadian and Australian banks have fared much better than our own. There has been a second misconception that a consolidated regulator that regulates enterprises chartered at the national level cannot fairly supervise smaller community organizations and that it would do violence to our dual banking system. I might say as an aside, I, like the Chairman, believe the dual banking system is alive and well and an important fabric of our banking system and this would not do violence to it. In fact, interesting enough, even today, the OCC supervises well over a thousand community banking organizations whose businesses are local in character. That is, the national supervisor supervises over a thousand small banks. In fact, it is the majority of the banks it supervises, the vast majority, and they choose that as a matter of their own predilection, not by rule. Indeed, today, all our Federal regulators regulate large institutions and smaller institutions. A new consolidated supervisor at the Federal level would merely pick up the FDIC and Federal Reserve examination and supervisory authorities. To emphasize, all the consolidated supervisor would do is take the Federal component and move it to another Federal box. It would not change the regulation or the fabric of that supervision. Third, some have claimed that a consolidated institutional supervisor would not have the benefit of other regulatory voices. This would clearly not be the case, as a consolidated institutional supervisor would fulfill only one piece of the regulatory landscape. The Federal Reserve, Treasury, SEC, FDIC, CFTC, FINRA, FINCEN, OFAC, and the FHFA would continue to have important responsibilities with respect to the financial sector. In addition, proposals are being made to add additional elements to the U.S. financial regulatory landscape, the Systemic Risk Council and a new financial consumer agency. This would leave multiple financial regulators at the Federal level and 50 bank regulators, 50 insurance regulators, and 50 securities regulators at the State level. It seems to me that is a lot of voices. Fourth, some have also claimed that the primary work of the Federal Reserve--monetary policy, payment system, and acting as the bank of last resort--and the FDIC--deposit insurance--would be seriously hampered if they did not have supervisory responsibility. The evidence does not support these claims. One, a review of FOMC minutes does not suggest much, if any, use is made of supervisory data in monetary policy activities. In the case of the FDIC, it has long relied on a combination of publicly available data and examination data from the other agencies. Two, there are not now, to my knowledge, any limitations on the ability of the Federal Reserve or the FDIC to collect any bank supervisory data. Indeed, if need be, the Federal Reserve or the FDIC can accompany another agency's examination team to obtain relevant data or review relevant practices. Three, if the FDIC or the Federal Reserve does not have adequate cooperation on gathering information, Congress can make clear by statute that this must be the case. And four, even if the FDIC were not the supervisor of State chartered banking entities, the FDIC would continue to have back-up supervisory authority and be able to be resident-- resident--in any bank it chose. Finally, I would note that it is important that the new consolidated supervisor be an independent agency for at least three reasons. First, banking supervision should not be subject to political influence. Second, the agency and the agency head needs the stature of the Federal Reserve, SEC, or FDIC to attract talented people and to be taken seriously by the other agencies. Third, and this, I think, is critically important, Congress, in fulfilling its oversight function--its critical oversight function--must hear the unfettered truth about the banking system from the head of its supervisory agency, not views filtered through another department or agency. And indeed, I would go further. I think it is incredibly difficult for you to fulfill your oversight responsibilities with an alphabet soup of regulators. Indeed, having regulators that have clear missions, it seems to me, makes it possible for you to exercise your critical function in a more effective way. If one pushed these together even more, as has been suggested by some, I think it becomes almost unmanageable for Congress. In sum, our country greatly needs a consolidated independent end-to-end institutional regulator.

"Mr. Baily","Well, thank you, Chairman Dodd and Members of the Committee, to give me a chance to talk about this issue. The summary of my testimony is, number one, I think that the best guide to financial reform is the objectives approach, which divides up regulation into microprudential, macroprudential, and conduct of business regulation. So we have to make sure that all parts of the financial sector are adequately supervised, we don't have gaps in regulation. We also want to make sure we don't have duplicative agencies. After all, there were plenty of regulators. There were rooms full of regulators. They didn't prevent this crisis. My second point is that the quality of regulation must be improved regardless of where it is done, and I don't want to denigrate anybody in the regulatory agencies, but I do think there is a problem that they may not always be well enough paid, have enough experience, or have the kind of stature that they need to deal with our very complex financial sector, particularly the large global banks. I don't think we want a situation where people are in Government jobs for a while and then they move over to the financial sector, viewing that as sort of where they are going to make their money. I think we want the regulatory jobs to be desirable and stable jobs and get the best people we can. I agree with the Chairman and very much with Gene Ludwig that we need a single Federal microprudential regulator, combining the supervisory functions currently carried out at the Fed, the OCC, the OTS, the SEC, and the FDIC. I think this regulator should partner closely with State regulators. You mentioned the importance of the community banks, and I agree with you on that. I would say, however, that some of the State chartered nonfinancial institutions were a source of a lot of the bad mortgages that were made, so I think having the right partnership between the Federal regulator and the State chartered enterprises is important. I think there should be a sharing of information there and perhaps of standards and appropriate methods and data. I do think, and this is going a little beyond the immediate discussion of this hearing, but I do think the U.S. does need an effective conduct of business regulator. That is an important part. As Gene said, that has been combined in the U.K., where the FSA was both the prudential regulator and the conduct of business regulator, and cobbling it all, the whole lot that was done there, I think that is a mistake. I think having a separate conduct of business regulator is a good idea. My own view is it would be nice to have that in a single agency, and I think the SEC is probably the place to put it, although the SEC, I must say, did not do a very good job in this crisis. But I think potentially the SEC should be the place that looks after small shareholders and also looks after consumers, so it would have a CFPA division within the SEC. Now, I know there is a case for having a separate consumer agency and I am not diametrically opposed to that. I think there are some advantages to the consolidation of having conduct of business regulation in one place, but a good CFPA on its own would be fine. Now, this structure that we are describing takes away from the Fed an important part of its existing power, which is what has been to supervise the bank holding companies, most of the large banks and a number of the smaller banks. I think that is the right thing to do. I agree with Gene. I don't think this is something that the Fed has done particularly well. They are obviously paying a lot more attention to it now than they used to, but historically, I don't think that is something that they have done very well. I share that view with my colleague, Alice Rivlin, who I think has testified to this Committee, and she was there and saw the point that Gene Ludwig made, which is that the prudential people haven't typically had a lot of say on Open Market Committee meetings. That hasn't been a main thing. I do think it is very important that the Fed, as the lender of last resort to the financial sector, does have to have information about what is going on in the banks. I think that was a significant failure in the U.K., where the FSA and the Bank of England were so separate and were not talking to each other, and I think Mervyn King, the head of the Bank of England, thought it was inappropriate for him to talk too much to the FSA. He wanted the independence of the Bank of England when they were making monetary policy. You know, I see his argument, but I think that was a big mistake and one of the things that got them into trouble. So I think we should have a lot of lines of communication shared between the regulators and the Federal Reserve so that they can set monetary policy with the adequate amount of information and that they are aware of what is going on in the banks, and if they need to be a lender of last resort, that is not suddenly sprung on them. But I think they don't have to be the people that are doing the day-to-day supervision. Another point I would like to make in this regard is that the big bank holding companies, or the big banks, as we know, both investment banks or the traditional commercial banks, are run as single entities. So the idea that you had a bank holding company which was sort of a separate entity from the bank itself really is not the way things operate. These were run from the top and these banks would sort of come up with a new line of business, something that was going to be profitable, and they would discuss it, and then as someone was walking about the door, they would sort of say, well, which legal entity shall we put this in, and the answer to that was typically, well, where would they get the most favorable tax treatment? Where would they get the most favorable regulatory treatment? It is not as if these things were really different entities. So I think another advantage of having a single prudential regulator is that they would regulate these businesses top to bottom as single companies, which is what they are. I have used up my time. The last thing I want to say is to reinforce the point that Gene made. I think we both had the same reaction when we attended the hearing in August. You know, it is natural for regulators to say, well, don't close my agency. Mine is all right. When you came back and some of the other Members of the Committee came back and said, well, shouldn't we consolidate, shouldn't we make this a more rationally organized regulatory structure, the answer came back, well, the U.K. had trouble and they had this single regulator, so we don't see why that should do any good. That prompted, I think, both of us to go take a look--Gene probably knew already, but I actually went to take a look at regulation around the world, not covering every country, but trying to cover several countries, and particularly the English-speaking countries which tend to have some similarity of their institutions, and you are right. Canada, I think, did a much better job. They do actually have quite a few different agencies, so they weren't my ideal. I think Australia, which actually the Paulson Blueprint pointed to, is to be commended. They took quite a while. They decided, what is the best way to regulate. They took their time in doing it. They consolidated in an appropriate way. What happened in the U.K.--and I grew up in the U.K., I am fond of the U.K., but they didn't do this very well--Gordon Brown came in as Chancellor of the Exchequer and he said, it is crazy to have all these agencies. I think he was right about that. That the functions that these different companies are performing are crossing boundaries and we want to have a single agency. But they hadn't made any preparation. They hadn't really laid the groundwork for doing it. They hadn't figured out how to do it well. And, in fact, the FSA remained really quite divided. There were a lot of different subagencies within that, so they weren't communicating well, and as I said earlier, they weren't communicating with the Bank of England. So I think the examples that were given last time to say, oh, other countries--a single agency doesn't work in other countries, I think that is wrong. I think if you look in the right place, you will find that having a single prudential regulator is pretty much what is the right choice to make, based on international experience. Let me stop there. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MARTIN N. BAILY, SENIOR FELLOW, ECONOMIC STUDIES, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Dr. Baily. Dr. Carnell? Thank you very much, Doctor, for being with us.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, our current bank regulatory structure is and remains a source of serious problems. Its defects are significant and longstanding. The system is needlessly complex, needlessly expensive, and imposes needless compliance burdens on banks. It impedes--it blunts regulators' accountability with a tangled web of overlapping jurisdictions and responsibilities, and it gives credence to the old saying, when everyone is responsible, no one is responsible. The system wastes time, wastes energy. It hinders timely action by regulators. It brings policy down to the lowest common denominator that four agencies can agree on. And it takes a particular toll on far-sighted action, action aimed at preventing future problems. That is because so often in policymaking, there is someone who says, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. So it is a lot easier to get agreement when you wait until you are confronted with a problem than when you are trying to look ahead and head off problems to begin with. Now, there is a straightforward solution to the problems we see from our fragmented regulatory system, and that solution is to unify the supervision of FDIC-insured depository institutions, banks and thrifts, in a single agency. Treasury Department Lloyd Bentsen offered that solution here in this room 15 years ago and it made sense at the time. I worked with him in preparing that proposal, and I think the events of the last 15 years bear out the wisdom of that approach. This new agency would take on the existing bank regulatory responsibilities of the OCC, OTS, Federal Reserve, and FDIC. The Federal Reserve would retain all its existing central banking functions, including monetary policy, the discount window, and the payment system. The FDIC would retain all its deposit insurance powers and responsibilities, including back- up examination and enforcement authority. On top of that, under the approach I propose, the Fed and the FDIC would be on the board of the new agency, let us say a five- or seven-member board with those two agencies represented. The Fed and FDIC could have their examiners participate in examinations conducted by the new agency, and they would have full access to supervisory information. So the Fed and FDIC would get all the information they get now and their examiners could be part of teams in all FDIC-insured banks, which is more access than they customarily enjoy now. This straightforward structure would be a major improvement over the current fragmented structure. It would promote clarity, efficiency, accountability, and timely action. Equally important, it would give the bank regulator greater independence from special interest pressure. That is, this new agency would regulate the full spectrum of FDIC-insured institutions. There wouldn't be the sort of subspecialization category like we see with thrift institutions. Now, if you look at the thrift debacle, for example, you see that thrift regulation was better when it was done by agencies that had a broad jurisdiction than when it was done by specialized thrift-only regulators. So, for example, at the Federal level, we had thrifts regulated by both the FDIC, which regulated the traditional savings banks, and we had thrifts regulated by the specialized Federal Home Loan Bank Board. FDIC-regulated thrifts were much less likely to fail and, if they did fail, caused smaller losses than the Home Loan Bank Board-regulate thrifts, and we see the same thing at the State level. At the State level, in about two-thirds, three-quarters of the States, the State Banking Commissioners supervise thrifts, and in those States, the losses to the insurance fund were much lower than we saw in States with specialized thrift regulators, and that is basically because the thrift regulators had no reason for being if there wasn't a thrift industry, and so they looked for every way to keep thrift institutions going, even when, in fact, it was unrealistic at that point. The result was a failure to deal effectively with troubled thrifts, much larger losses to the Deposit Insurance Fund. A unified structure would have another major advantage. It would recognize the reality of how banking organizations actually operate, and Dr. Baily already touched on this, as well. Under the existing system, each agency looks at only part of the organization. But in these organizations, you may, in fact, have the various parts doing business with each other extensively, and to evaluate risk, you need to look at the whole, think about the whole, and it sure helps in doing that to be responsible for the whole. So the fragmented system hinders the agency from getting the full picture. Here is how Secretary Bentsen described the problem. Under our current system, any one regulator may see only a limited piece of a dynamic, integrated banking organization when a larger perspective is crucial, both for effective supervision of the particular organization and for an understanding of broader industry conditions and interests. Mr. Chairman, if I could, I wanted to speak a bit to the question of holding company regulation, which came up earlier. First, I want to note something that may not be widely appreciated, and that is that holding companies as a major subject of regulation, that thing is unique to the United States. In other countries, the regulation focuses on the bank. Regulators look out, reach out, but it is not like we have got people devoting their careers to the Bank Holding Company Act. And here is what two of the leading experts, Pauline Heller and Melanie Fein, say. Bank holding companies have no inherent necessity in a banking system. They developed in the United States only because of our unique banking laws which historically limited geographic location and activities of banks. Their only material purpose has been to serve as vehicles for getting into things banks couldn't get into directly. So this puts it into perspective. There is nothing magical. There is nothing high priestly about bank holding company regulation. There is no need for a separate holding company regulator. A bank regulator can fully handle all the functions of a holding company regulator, policing the banks' transactions with the banks and looking at overall risk. In conclusion, Secretary Bentsen, speaking from this table in 1994, underscored the risk of continuing to rely on what he called ``a dilapidated regulatory system that is ill-defined to prevent future banking crises and ill-equipped to cope with crises when they occur.'' He observed in words eerily applicable to the present that our country had just emerged from its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, a crisis that our bank regulatory system did not adequately anticipate or resolve. And he issued this warning, which we would yet do well to heed. If we fail to fix the system now, the next financial crisis we face will again reveal its flaws, and who suffers then? Our banking industry, our economy, and potentially the taxpayers. You have the chance to help prevent that result. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RICHARD S.

He was a wonderful Member of the Senate and a very good Secretary of the Treasury as well. So thank you for being with us. Welcome, Mr. Hillman. Nice to see you, and thank you for being here. Thank you for your service to the GAO, 31 years. Congratulations on that contribution.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Hillman","Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to discuss issues relating to efforts to reform the regulatory structure of our Nation's financial system. In January 2009, we reported on gaps and limitations in our current structure, and we presented a framework for evaluating proposals to modernize the U.S. financial regulatory system. Given the importance of the U.S. financial sector to the domestic and international economies, we also added modernization of the outdated regulatory structure as a new area to our high-risk list because the fragmented and outdated regulatory structure was ill-suited to meeting the challenges of the 21st century. My statement today, which is based on prior reports that we have completed, focuses on how regulation has evolved and recent work that further illustrates the significant limitations and gaps in the existing regulatory structure, the experiences of countries with other types of varying regulatory structures and how they fared during the financial crisis, and our reviews on certain aspects and proposals to reform the regulatory system. I would like to make the following points: First, the current U.S. financial regulatory system is a fragmented and complex arrangement of Federal and State regulation that has been put into place over the past 150 years but has not kept pace with major developments in financial markets and products in recent decades. My prepared statement details numerous examples from our prior work identifying major limitations of the Nation's fragmented banking regulatory structure. For example, in July, we reported that less comprehensive oversight by various regulators responsible for overseeing fair lending laws intended to prevent lending discrimination may allow many violations by independent mortgage lenders to go undetected. That same month, we also reported that regulatory capital measures did not always fully capture certain risks and that none of the multiple regulators responsible for individual markets or institutions had clear responsibility to assess the potential effects or the build-up of systemwide leverage. Recent proposals to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system include some elements that would likely improve oversight of the financial markets and make the system more sound, stable, and safer for consumers and investors. For example, under proposals under the Administration and others, new regulatory bodies would be created that would be responsible for assessing threats that could pose systemic risks. Our past work has clearly identified the need for a greater focus on systemwide risks in the regulatory system. In addition, the Administration and others are proposing to create a new entity that would be responsible for ensuring that consumers of financial services are adequately protected. Our past work has found that consumers often struggled to understand complex financial products, and the various regulators responsible for protecting them have not always performed effectively. As a result, the creation of a separate consumer protection regulator is one sound way for ensuring that consumers are better protected from unscrupulous sales practices and inappropriate financial products. However, our analysis indicates that additional opportunities for further consolidating the number of Federal regulators exist that would decrease fragmentation, reduce the potential for differing regulatory treatment, and improve regulatory independence. For example, the Administration's proposal would only combine the current regulators for national banks and thrifts into one agency while leaving the three other depository institution regulators--the Federal Reserve, FDIC, and the regulator for credit unions, NCUA--intact. Our work has revealed that multiple regulators who perform similar functions can be problematic. When multiple regulators exist, variations in their resources and expertise can limit their effectiveness. The need to coordinate their actions can hamper their ability to quickly respond to market events, and institutions engaging in regulatory arbitrage by changing regulators through reduced scrutiny or their activities or to threaten to change regulators in order to weaken regulatory actions against them. Having various regulators that are funded by assessments from the institutions they regulate can also in such regulators become overly dependent on individual large institutions for funding, which could compromise their independence in overseeing such firms. As a result, we would urge the Congress to consider additional opportunities to consolidate regulators as it deliberates reform of our regulatory system. Finally, regardless of any regulatory reforms that are adopted, we urge the Congress to continue to actively monitor the progress of such implementation and be prepared to make legislative adjustments to ensure that any changes in the U.S. financial regulatory system are as effective as possible. In addition, we believe that it is important that Congress provide for appropriate GAO oversight of any regulatory reforms to ensure accountability and transparency in any new regulatory system, and GAO stands ready to assist the Congress in its oversight capacity and evaluate the progress agencies are making implementing any changes. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to discuss these critical issues and would be happy to respond to any questions at the appropriate time.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RICHARD J. HILLMAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, FINANCIAL MARKETS AND COMMUNITY INVESTMENT TEAM, GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. Let me thank all of you on behalf of the Committee for your testimony and your observations. They have been very, very helpful this afternoon. Let me pick up on the issue of the community banks and the issue of a single regulator, because I think this is where maybe the most contentious political problems arise. I want to underscore the point--I think, Gene, you made it, others may have made it as well--that we have a lot of community banks that are operating under Federal charters and, in fact, are regulated at the Federal level. I think you mentioned 1,000 or a number like that. And at a time, obviously, when they could have easily, under the present system, decided to migrate from that to a State charter--they may have had their own reasons for not doing so, but the fact that so many have stayed with a Federal regulator indicates a relatively high degree of satisfaction in terms of how they were being handled, in the midst of that same institution handling the Chases, the JPMorgans, and Bank of America and other large institutions. So you have the largest number of community banks in many ways maintaining a regulatory structure where there is duality. But it is of concern, and I think we need to address it in ways that are practical. There have been some suggestions, something along this line, and I would like to maybe get a little more in the weeds on this. How do you envision, if we had a single regulator, a division within that regulator to be able to handle the concerns of the community banks, particularly ones that would be State chartered, how they would handle that in a way that would give them some degree of satisfaction that they are not going to be lumped together in a way that would diminish their capacity to be able to function and get lost in the shuffle? How do you do that? I would ask all of you, and if you have got any ideas on that, I would be interested in your thoughts.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Well, Mr. Chairman, I think that it is important for the new regulatory agency to have departments that are specialized in dealing with institutions of a particular size. The Comptroller's office currently has three segments: one deals with small banks, one midsized, one large. I think that there are specialized techniques, ability to simplify supervision for community banks, and I think it is important. In that regard, I think the same kind of sensitivity to small bank supervision can be found both at the Federal Reserve and the FDIC. Remember, the only thing that one would do in terms of this new agency would be to move the Federal component of the supervisory authority to the new agency. It would not change the component. But I think one can have a separate division that focuses on simplifying it. I think that Congress, in writing these rules itself, ought to mandate that simplified treatment--that one of the responsibilities of the new agency is to reduce burden wherever possible, particularly in terms of community and regional financial institutions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Dr. Baily.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Yes, I agree very much with what Gene said. I think that can be handled within a single regulator. The Federal Reserve currently supervises the bank holding companies, and you think of them as the big ones. But, actually, some of them are pretty small. They have got quite a range. So they have been supervising both big and small banks. So I think it is certainly possible to have a separate division within the prudential regulator that looks to the needs of community banks, and I think it is very important that small banks not be overburdened with regulation. One wants different requirements, perhaps, different capital requirements for a bank that has large overseas operations, subsidiaries. That has become--it seems too big to fail, although I hope we can overcome that problem. The needs there are very different than the community banks, and I think that should be part of the legislation taking account of that.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I should have asked this of Gene as well. In your examination of global examples, you mentioned Australia and Canada, and I do not know this, so I apologize for my ignorance on this. I do not know what the Australian banking system looks like. Is there duality there at all? Or is this all one system? Is there any place you looked at that has a comparable duality of systems that would----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Well, there certainly are countries that have small banks. Germany has a lot of small banks, actually many of them State-owned banks that ended up buying quite a bit of CDOs as a matter of fact. So they did not always make good decisions. Typically, in Canada, you have some small banks, but really the market is dominated by about five or half a dozen very large banks. So I do not think they are quite comparable to the U.S., which, as you say, or somebody said earlier, grew up because of geographical limitations. I do not know whether you want to add to it.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Do you have anything on that, Gene?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","First, Canada does have a Federal system, and there are some smaller institutions. But there is no place on Earth that really quite has the number of commercial banking institutions that we do. Having said that, the point is well taken that Germany does have a good many landesbanks, and I think a survey of the world would reveal other consolidated supervisory mechanisms that deal with small banks and large banks and do it effectively. And I think Canada is probably a pretty good example, actually, though they are not as numerous.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, Germany is sort of the antithesis of ours. That is a highly decentralized system in many ways in Germany.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Carnell","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Yes, three things. First, Secretary Bentsen's legislative proposal included a statutory requirement establishing a community banking division within the agency seeking to institutionalize a sensitivity to the ways community banks are different and the ways they should not be treated just the same as larger institutions. And I think--and this is my second point--that something like that, even though in a sense it is just an outline of an idea, it sends a signal that Congress cares about it, that it is something that needs to be done. I think that is a signal that the agency will clearly hear. And then, third, in any event the new agency would have every incentive to foster a healthy community banking system. The agency has no reason to favor large over small, and there are advantages to the agency when bankers come in, for example, to talk to Members of Congress, that people are having a positive experience with the new agency. So there is absolutely no reason for the regulator to hold back from doing the best job it can. There is no reason why a unified regulator would do any less of a good job than what we see now where an agency like the OCC regulates from the largest banks down to some of the smallest. Finally, you mentioned duality, and in case you were asking about a dual banking system, that is not something that you see abroad. That is, to my knowledge, a quirk of U.S. regulation having to do basically with some developments in the 1860s and 1870s.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Hillman","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Hillman","There clearly are ways to provide a voice for State banks or community banks and still achieve great consolidation of the banking regulatory structure. I agree with Rick that one of the ways in which you could achieve that would be to establish a division within that prudential regulator to serve the needs of community and State member institutions. Another way of achieving that goal would also be, like the FDIC currently has with its board structure, to ensure that membership of that board might include members that have a background or might have been a prior community banker in the past. That would give that regulator the opportunity to have that voice heard at the highest levels of the institution.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Good idea. Good suggestion.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank each of you for your testimony. I know Gene and Marty we have talked with--a great deal about this and certainly appreciate the two of you coming in. I am going to ask some questions that do not necessarily reflect my point of view but just to probe. I am open on all of these issues and am still, like many Members on this Committee, trying to figure out what is the best route or have you all propose something, and maybe a hybrid of that is best, who knows? But hopefully we will get to that--I know we will-- before we regulate. You mentioned the issue of having an alphabet soup of people coming to talk to us, and it is not unlike having witnesses come before our Committee with differing points of views in many ways. I have to tell you, I have enjoyed that. Each of the regulators, sometimes gleefully, sometimes not, points out the deficiencies of the other regulator. And I have to tell you, there is some merit in that. Just for what it is worth, you know, to have a captive regulator, much like we have with the GSEs, which would be the case with all banks, to me, could be very problematic. I think having feet on the ground sometimes gives you a sense--I know in my business it was very important to be in various States where we were building. As Senators, we go back home to our States to not be Washingtonized, and there is just some benefit of having feet on the ground, as the FDIC has argued and as the Fed has argued. And then the OCC to me is the most procyclical--which what we are talking about is a super OCC. Let us face it. They are the most procyclical organization that we have. They move quickly in a direction that creates bubbles, and now they are out throughout the country. Anybody that has got a commercial real estate loan or anything like it is being criticized, and so they are creating, I think strongly creating a self- fulfilling prophecy. So I would love to hear your comments about the RUBs being helpful in some cases and the competition being helpful, but also what would be in this to keep the OCC--super OCC, if you will--from being so procyclical as they are now.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Well, Senator, a couple of comments. I agree with your comment that if one were to homogenize the entire regulatory system down to one, there would be something that would be lost. But we are not homogenizing it down to one. First, the FDIC itself has back-up supervisory authority, which means the FDIC would have on-site continued responsibilities. Second, as I mentioned, both the FDIC and the Fed would have serious information gathering and review authorities.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","But that does not happen now. I mean, they do not share information now. I know you said we could put that in law, but that is problematic.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Well, I am not honestly sure that is the case. There are certainly claims that that is the case. If it is the case, it is heart-stopping because in the midst of this crisis, one would assume that the information the Fed and the FDIC and other agencies need to do the job would be forthcoming or they would be squawking, I mean big time, to you and others. In addition, we are talking about a systemic regulator. There is the SEC, the CFTC, FINRA. There are all these other agencies, and in terms of giving you the kind of diversity you need to hear other points of view, you will still have the 50 State bank supervisors that can be called up. So you get quite a--even with a simplified Federal regulatory mechanism, you get quite a cacophony of other voices that I think is available. As to your comment on procyclicality, I think that there is the nature of all regulators, and I think that actually if you looked at all the agencies, both at the Federal and State level, you would find that in times of stress they become tougher. You see the calls at the G-20 and others for more capital right now, sort of in a crisis.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Which creates a bigger crisis.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Which has a tendency to be procyclical, which is not desirable. The Spanish had it right in terms of their-- through their cycle provisioning and through their cycle capital rules, which I am very hopeful that will be adopted in this country. But I do not think that is limited just to the OCC. It is something, I agree with you, that deserves criticism because an evenhanded effort and a push to an evenhanded effort is highly desirable.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And let me just--I know my time is about up. The clock must have been on 2 minutes today.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Your questions are so eloquent.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","OK. There you go. If you would--and I know Marty is getting--and this is my last, just to advance this a little bit, the procyclical piece to me is a huge problem that you do not necessarily create by your formula, but it is something that has not served us well. The same thing happens in 1990 and 1991, and we just do a really poor job of it. There is nothing in your proposal that, for instance, changes--I mean, much of this is about rearranging the deck chairs and just getting different people--it is almost a family squabble. We sometimes refer to the insurance industry's issue the same way. But what they do is also very important, and, you know, the--for instance, the counterparty risk, I mean, is this--is there anything about any of this that changes their ability to really look to those deficiencies that really are the heart of the problem here, that really are causing us right now to be doing what we are doing? And, Marty, you may answer that, and I will stop.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Well, I agree with you very much, Senator, that simply creating a single prudential regulator is not going to solve all our problems. The deficiencies of our system are greater than that, and there were a lot of private failures. We need to try to improve private incentives so that people do not get to play with other people's money and they take on the risk if the risk is there. So I agree with you completely. This is not by any means going to solve all our problems. I think it does help, though, because it allows for the kind of consolidated regulation that can, if necessary, stand up to the big banks and make sure that they are following the right rules. It can respond, it has got the resources and the stature to respond to innovation because one of the problems with regulation is you are always sort of one step behind what the private market is trying to do. And we want to encourage that innovation, but at the same time, we do not want it to be in the direction of making things less safe. So on the procyclicality side, we need to get rid of that. First of all, I think we need higher capital requirements so that in good times there is plenty of capital, and in bad times we can sort of cushion that shock. So that needs to be part of the reform, too, is how we deal with cyclicality, and there are some proposals there for so-called ``contingent capital'' or ``convertible capital'' that allow you to do that. So I think that should be an important part of the regulatory changes. I just think also on the diversity of views, the way I would put it is that we need to make sure that our prudential regulator is accountable. I mean, there are a lot of people-- again, I do not want to impugn anybody in particular, but some regulators made some very bad decisions in this process. And, you know, do they still have jobs? Maybe they should not. We need to set up this structure in a way that preserves accountability whether it is a single prudential regulator or more than one.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Mr. Chairman, could I just add two quick points here?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, certainly.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","First, that the agency, Senator Corker, would incorporate a diversity of views because under what I am proposing it would have the Fed and the FDIC on its board. They would share in making policy. But even so, they are likely to have some disagreement with what comes out, and they will let you know about the disagreement. You would have more diversity within such a board than you would at most any independent agency and the rest of the Government. Second, it is key in preventing crisis to look ahead and fix the roof while the sky is still blue, not to wait until the thunderstorm is brewing up. Now, as for being procyclical--and I am building on that point--the Federal Reserve has actually tried to get rid of one of the existing two capital standards: the leverage limit. It has tried at least twice in the past 15 years. The existing capital standards were set in 1986 and 1992. We had years of enormous, unprecedented prosperity, record profits, and nothing was done to raise capital standards that had been set as the second best during a crisis. So I think the existing system, including the Fed's role in it, does not look good at all there.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Chairman Dodd, Senator Warner and I had a summit last night down at Johnny's Half Shell, and----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Why weren't we invited?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","This whole issue, I think, of leverage is one that certainly we need to look at. You know, we actually urge people in this country to use leverage, but we penalize equity. And I hope that as we move through this, that is something that we will look at more closely. I am sorry to take so much time.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Not at all.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, gentlemen, very much for your testimony. It seems that you are coalescing around the advice of the single consolidated regulator, and I just want to understand what the landscape will look like afterwards in simple terms. There will be essentially two banking regulators--the FDIC and the Federal regulator. Is that your approach, Mr. Ludwig, focused on----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Well, first there would be an----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","No, I know the SEC is there and other things.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","But in terms of bank lending, you would have a highly professionalized institutional regulator, and to Senator Corker's concerns about procyclicality and also--I do not think it would be a super OCC. One of the problems with the current alphabet soup is nobody is large enough, professional enough that there is really the kind of study, focus, or stature for these supervisors to be able to go head to head adequately on things like derivatives, emerging new capital structures, et cetera. So I think that you would have two that would be at the Federal level close to supervision, but the Federal Reserve by nature, with its information gathering, study, and concern would be actively involved in thinking about these issues and prescribing solutions. And the new systemic council or systemic enterprise would also be very much a backstop to the banking supervision, as it would be a backstop to other regulatory issues throughout the Federal and State systems.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, let me just take a step further and focus on the point that Professor Baily made about the top-to- bottom bank holding company regulation. Would that be the Federal Reserve, or would that be the new----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Oh, no, that absolutely has to be the new institutional supervisor. The notion, the stopping at the border, I think Mr. Baily said it really quite eloquently. Stopping at the border is absolutely pernicious, because if you have an examination issue and you really want to follow that through, you cannot basically have a situation where it migrates to another enterprise and the investigator cannot get to it, cannot see it, cannot enforce it. It must be holistic.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","No, I accept that, but typically bank holding companies today are deposit-taking institutions, investment banks, proprietary traders, wealth management, et cetera. SEC has a responsibility, the CFTC. So just give me an idea of how this new Federal regulator who has got top-to-bottom responsibilities interacts with SEC, CFTC, and everybody else. That would have to be done, correct?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Yes, it would, and to the point that there would not only be one. It would have the ability to investigate in detail and would have the responsibility to be an expert in all the financial issues that are important to the institution. But it would have, if you will, a colook, a coexamination, coconcerns from these other agencies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","You know, it goes to the point that was made, which is that when everyone is in charge, who is in charge? And we saw that so many times.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","But it would be primarily in charge, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","So it would be very clear that this regulator would be the primary regulator of all these functions, even if they feel under the range of CFTC or SEC.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","In my view, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Yes, in my view, also. Now, I do think the systemic regulator, whether it is a council or whether it is the Federal Reserve--I think myself I would prefer it to be the Federal Reserve, but whichever--does have, I think, the need to look across our whole financial sector because the prudential regulator is basically saying, Is this institution safe and sound? And we then have a consumer protection agency that is saying, ``Is it behaving itself with respect to the consumer?'' But we need to have a systemic regulator that says, ``Do we have within our financial system a buildup of risky assets? Are we seeing a huge rise in risks being taken?'' Paul Volcker remarked that one of the clearest signs that a financial institution was going to get into trouble was that it was building a fancy new headquarters. So I think, you know, if you see somebody making lots of money doing something that--that may be because they are very good, or it may be because they are taking a lot of risk.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Just a quick question. The FDIC is supported by its own fundraising activities, to put it mildly. One of our problems, frankly, is that we have underresourced at critical moments our bank regulators, our SEC. It goes to the point that you have all made. Where is the expertise? Where are the computer systems? How can you keep up with five Ph.D.s when you are, you know, a recent law school graduate? So should we have this agency dedicated funding, not through the appropriations process?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","It should be dedicated funding by the industry. I do not think it needs to cost the taxpayer a nickel, and it ought to have, as is true today with the Federal Reserve, plenty of deep pockets to be able to do its job correctly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","If I may, one final question. We have talked about one Federal regulator for Federal institutions. Should there be one Federal charter? Should we eliminate the Federal thrift charter, the Federal savings bank charter, et cetera?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","I do not think you need to do that. I think the issue of the Federal thrift charter is an issue that is fundamentally steeped in the housing policy of the United States. That is, do we want to foster housing as a special goal. That decision need not be made if you have a single consolidated institutional supervisor.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, gentlemen.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","My inclination might be to create a single charter for these Federal institutions. I do not think I will fall on my sword on that one, but that would be my inclination. And to go back to Senator Corker's point, we do have a lot of provisions in our tax law and our laws to promote homeownership, and I think that is a good idea. I think homeownership is a good thing. But as part of that, we also promote borrowing. I mean, we really do, and maybe we have gone too far in that direction.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Just one final point. Professor Baily, you made, I think, a very cute observation. Most of the decisions where to stick these functions were a function of regulatory preference and tax law. And as we sort of look at reforming our regulatory system, I do not think we can be sort of oblivious to tax provisions that----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","----can form behavior more than our regulators. And as we go forward systematically, I think we really have to look at the Tax Code as well as the Federal regulations and Federal banking law.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","That is very good. And good suggestions, by the way.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the panel. It is a little challenging. You have raised a lot of the issues I was hoping to. I guess that is the challenge of being far down the table here. But I will try to re-ask the same questions perhaps. As somebody who has been an advocate, as I think some of the panel knows, of a single end-to-end regulator, you know, I want to go back to what the Chairman raised around some of the, I think, legitimate concerns that the community banks and smaller banks have offered, and I would be happy to have any member of the panel comment on this. I do think there is--the notion of a separate division makes some sense, but in any large organization is not the bias going to be toward the larger institutions? Is the best personnel going to want to seek out serving the larger institutions? And could you--what other protections could we ensure to make sure that the smaller banks do not get the short end of the stick? And I believe a couple of you mentioned-- Martin, you mentioned as well that you could have different regulatory standards. And I guess I would like you to touch a little bit on that. How do we make sure that if we were to go with the single end-to-end regulator you would not be imposing the same overly burdensome set of regulations on a very small community-based bank that you might be on a major bank holding company?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","First, I would say----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Oh, I am sorry, Martin.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","No, no. Go ahead. No, please, you start, and it gives me more time to think.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","First, I would say, Senator, that I do think that it makes sense to enact protections so that community banks--one, it is a comfort that they are protected in terms of having a simplified, specialized regulatory approach that best suits their needs. Having said that, my own experience at the OCC, where there are--in my day, I think over 2,000 community banks. It may be actually true today. I used the word a thousand--is that you do have the quality people at the agency devoting their attention to the community banking sector. Indeed, one of the advantages of having a consolidated regulator is, as people come up, you have similar talent available for both sides of the aisle, and you find--today, for example, the gentleman in charge of small bank supervision at the OCC was a large bank supervisor during his time, and he is one of the most talented people there. I think you will find that interplay. The danger, I think, works the other way, that if you separate the two, you will only have second-class supervisors at the smaller institutions as opposed to having the cross- fertilization you do with the larger institutions. The other thing I think worth pointing out is just because you are smaller or larger does not necessarily mean you are more complex or less complex. Some of the smaller institutions by choice get involved in fairly complex issues, and there is going to be a tendency as we go into the future, because of the Internet, because of technology, because of the structured products available, that smaller institutions will indeed get involved with these more complex activities, and the supervisor not only needs to supervise that adequately, A, but it also needs to have the sophistication to help the small bank with these products. I think it is perfect doable, and I think you will just have a higher-quality supervision generally. One cannot also overstate in this whole discussion the pernicious nature of regulatory arbitrage. I know that is not your question. But both having----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","That was my next question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","As a supervisor, whether it is your examiners that get threatened by the offhand, intended remark of some bad actor banks saying, look, we do not have to put up with this, we can move to another regulator, and how that--even if you are being tough at headquarters to do the right thing, how that can degrade the quality of supervision generally. That is not just theoretical, but if you have to do it every day, it is real.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Before Marty answers, I do think that is a valid point, that we sometimes look at the arbitrage in terms of banks that have actually switched charters and some of those that were very much engaged in the crisis, but I think that is a very important point you raised, that if simply the implied threat of switching may end up utilizing that regulatory arbitrage and consequently not having the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","When I was Comptroller, Senator, I had bankers in my office when they were unhappy threaten me, and my examiners, I know, had to live it in the field during their time, and I think most folks who have experienced that would have that, and that is really--it degrades the quality of supervision.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","I would like to reinforce that view, and I think it is why--you know, in general, I am a big fan of competition as a means of making things more efficient and creating diversity, but competition among regulators can have this downside of regulatory arbitrage. Let me comment on the point about maybe different requirements. You know, Senator Dodd mentioned that it may be difficult politically. That shouldn't govern what decision is made. It may be difficult politically to do consolidation, so I think one thing that needs to be sure to be in the legislation is that we satisfy the community banks that we are looking after them, because otherwise, there is going to be a lot of resistance to this legislation. And obviously, as individuals, we all like the devil we know, so to speak, and people want to hold on to the regulator they have, and that is another reason they are resistant to this consolidation. So I think it is very important that we carve out for the community banks a sense that they will be looked after, they won't be subject to burdensome regulations. On the other end of the scale, for the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Can you speak to that for a moment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Yes----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I know my time is running out, but just how could we put in place, or what kind of guidelines so that you wouldn't perhaps have the same level of burdensome regulation for a small community bank versus a major bank holding company?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Well, I think I would defer to my colleagues on the details. The part of it that I think I would like to comment on is the capital requirements. I actually don't like the idea of designating Tier 1 institutions. I don't like the idea of trying to cap the size of institutions. But clearly, we need to do something so that we don't end up bailing out these great big institutions. So having a sort of sliding scale, that the bigger you are or the more interconnected you are or depending on the kind of activity you do, that the capital requirements and potentially the extent of supervision--how often, the nature, the information you have to report, how frequently you have to report it--those kinds of things could increase as an institution becomes larger or more important to the system, and I think that is also a way of taking some of the burden off of the community banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","If I might, Senator, I would reserve the right to come back to the Committee with a list of suggestions, because I come from a small town myself, and I am a huge believer in community banks. I think it is one of the great benefits here in the United States, one of the great forces for good and innovation, and I think the consolidated supervisor at the end of the day will do more to support community banking than the current system.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","And it may even get down to not simply capital requirements, but literally forms and volume of forms they have to----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Right. Right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I know my time is expiring. One final point, Mr. Chairman. I won't ask the question, but I just want to follow up on Senator Reed's comments, and again, it is part of what the panel has made mention of. When we have seen these kind of closed doors take place that you have had before this panel, clearly the most visible example of that with the enormous scandal of Mr. Madoff and the fact that regulators were not able to go beyond their prescribed jurisdiction, and that clearly--thank goodness we have not had that same kind of travesty take place in the banking system, but this fact that we have got one focus looking at the bank holding company level, another looking at the bank depository piece, could create that same kind of--and as Senator Reed mentioned, the securities piece--failing to have that single end-to-end regulator that can look at the whole bank holding company and all of its operations would prevent that.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just, before I turn to Senator Merkley, it is a related question. Maybe Mark asked this in a way. Maybe he addressed it when I stepped out for a second, and that is on the issue of assessments, for instance. I don't know if you raised that or not, but do you see some? Because, clearly, if I am sitting back as a community banker, I am going, well, wait, yes, it is nice to have the division in all of this, but am I going to be assessed? I presume you wouldn't be, but I wonder if you would address that question, because clearly it is one of the concerns I would have. Could you address the issue of assessments?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","I think you must have a system that is countercyclical, while our current system is procyclical, and one that doesn't penalize the best community banks, which the current system does, and pay for the sins of the bad ones. So the system of assessments that funds this agency has to be one that takes into account not increasing the assessment for community banks and certainly not increasing the assessment for any banks in the storm, and I think that is achievable in terms of the way the institution is funded.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Legislatively, in some way, though, right?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Yes, sir. So, for example, the reserves on deposit at the Fed are currently used to fund the Federal Reserve's regulatory activities, I believe. One could use the reserves similarly to fund the regulatory activities of the new consolidated supervisor, if that was Congress's predilection, or part of it could be used to make sure that the community banks had a particularly fair opportunity to pay what was appropriate for them. I think there is a lot of plasticity in the way one could construct this to be fair and countercyclical in terms of the funding mechanism.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for your testimony. When Mr. Bernanke was before us, he made an argument that the Fed should be the principal entity both for monetary policy, prudential policy, consumer policy, and systemic risk-- everything----","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","and I raised my concern that some of these would be in conflict with each other and he made the best case he could that they fit very well together. I think the article that was in the Washington Post on Sunday that pointed out some of the failure to address consumer issues over a significant period of time in many ways goes to my concerns. I believe that what I am hearing from you all is summed up in part by what is in the GAO report, that the twin peaks model is viewed as advantageous by some because the two principle objectives of financial regulation, systemic protection and consumer protection, are fundamentally in conflict, and putting these objectives in different agencies institutionalizes the distinction and ensures that each agency focuses on a particular objective. It goes on. But does that fundamentally underlie the perspective that all four of you are bringing to the table?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Well, I think--I am an admirer of Ben Bernanke. I am not a close friend of his, but I have known him for a long time and I admire the way he handled this crisis. As I said in my testimony, I don't think the Fed--I am also an admirer of Alan Greenspan, who is a friend of mine, and I don't think-- leading up to this crisis, I think they made some very substantial mistakes when they didn't give enough consumer protection and they didn't react to some of the bad lending that was going on. So I think there were certainly a lot of mistakes that were made prior to this crisis that would have mitigated it. So, you know, I understand why, obviously, the Fed wants to hold on to the authorities it has, but I think what we are suggesting is that you take away the prudential regulation part, because that may be in conflict. You make sure that it still has access to the information it needs, but it is no longer the prudential regulator. I think the thing that the Federal Reserve has done well is monetary policy, not that they haven't made any mistakes, but if you look over the last, oh, 20, 30 years, I think they have done a good job, and typically when you pick people to serve on the Fed, you tend to pick economists or people with expertise in monetary policy, and that is the thing they should do, and I think they should also, since monetary policy is key to the stability of the economy, I think they should also be concerned with systemic stability. But I don't see why--they certainly haven't done a great job on prudential regulation and I don't see--what is the point of the Chairman of the Federal Reserve sitting around worrying about details of credit card regulation? That is what he is doing right now, and I think that is a mistake and not a good use of his time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Does anyone else want to comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Yes. A couple of things, Senator Merkley, if I could. First, the Federal Reserve argument that it needs to be a primary Federal bank regulator to do its monetary policy responsibilities are just not credible, based on facts at several levels. First, right now, the Federal Reserve only has supervisory responsibility for 13 percent of FDIC-insured assets and 10 percent of FDIC-insured institutions, so it is not a significant proportion at all. And then on top of that, our whole commercial banking system only accounts for 18 percent of credit market assets. Gone are the days when banks held 50 percent of those assets, as would have been true when I was born. There is just a big change in the growth of other financial markets and it is just out of touch with reality for someone to suggest that that Fed connection to being a primary Federal bank regulator is essential.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","I want to get into some other questions before I run out of time here, but Mr. Carnell, to follow up, you made a comment in regard to bank holding companies, that they exist to allow banks to get into businesses that are, and I am not sure if I caught this quite right, but incompatible with banking or very distinct from banking. Should we be eliminating bank holding companies? I mean, do they serve a-- what purpose do they serve----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Well, just so----","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","----more risk than value?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","I don't think we need to eliminate them, but I do think our system has put much too much emphasis on them. I think our focus in banking policy should be on what can banks do and how should they go about doing it. I wouldn't want to leave the impression that bank holding companies had this role as letting do something nefarious. I mean, we are talking about things like opening an office in the next county, opening a bank in the next State. These were things that restrictive laws of 50 years ago didn't allow. And then getting into nonbanking activities, many of which are not allowed in the bank or Congress has passed a law saying they could be in the same corporate family. So it is not that the activities were inherently problematic, but it is that we have this enormous growth of holding company regulation that is really unrelated to any real need other than the fact that we sort of built it up in these loophole-based ways.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","If I might, Senator, go a little farther, I would say that the comment--I forget whether it was Senator Corker or someone made, that, in fact, what happens when you have to make a decision at the corporate level, you ultimately decide what box to put it in for capital reasons or tax reasons, et cetera, and what happens then at the supervisory level--so I find something wrong in the bank. I can't go to that other entity. That other entity is not being supervised, and in fact, if you look at this current debacle, a great deal of the problem in the larger financial institutions was not in the technical bank. The bank was infected by it. It was actually in the nonbank affiliates that were hard to get to and it was hard to look at the animal as a whole. And if you are really going to be an effective supervisor--after all, everybody has the same interest, a healthier institution--you have got to do the whole piece.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you all. I am over my time. I will just close by echoing concerns about the community banks and also about our credit union system, where they have rules that have constrained their risk, not using prepayment penalties, having interest rate caps, and so forth. They are a little nervous about being rolled into a system with an unfamiliar regulator and perhaps paying fees disproportionate to the risk they impose on the system, and so our community banks and our credit unions may--are a little disturbed that they might not have been so much of the problem but may get rolled into a disadvantageous set of rules, and so of great interest. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","One of these things that is going to be important for us, this is not being punitive. I think that is one of the things we are getting into, this notion that because some have been good actors and bad actors, I think we have some history of that. So I think it is really important as we look at all of this, this is not to punish some or discipline some, but rather to try to think in 21st century architectural terms. How do we create an architecture and a structure that makes sense in all of this? And the only thing I was getting at on the assessment issue, because I think putting aside the question of who was responsible for what, just given the magnitude and size and complexity of institutions, I mean, the idea that you would level sort of the same assessments across the board because you have one regulator, to me would be offensive. I mean, you have got to clearly make some distinguishing features. But I hope we can stay away from the punitive quality here as we look at all of this. We can go back and examine, how did we get here and what we are trying to do, and I think all of us agree that, in part, it was this patchwork out there that contributed, certainly, among other things. It is not the only thing. I think somebody made that point, that there are a lot of issues we need to look at. This is one of one. And it isn't going to solve everything, either. I think Bob Corker made the point, and I agree with him on this, is the assumption that if you solve this, you would solve the problem, I think would be false. But clearly I want to get away--because I think you can see that developing, that argument that somehow we are laying--we are blaming institutions by putting them in this. That is not the argument at all. The question is whether or not this makes sense. Let me raise one other question I have for you, and then I will see if anyone has interest in a second round. I wonder if you agree with the Administration's proposal regarding the systemically important financial companies that have a parent or significant affiliate engaged in commercial activities, whether they should be regulated as a bank holding company and forced to divest commercial activities. This is a big issue that is going to be before us. It sort of follows on with Jeff's question, I think, that he raised. Does anyone want to jump into this one? Professor, you sound like you have got some strong views on this, so----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","I do. I think this is a very troublesome aspect of the Administration's proposal. I should emphasize that I am troubled mainly on its use of political capital. I don't know that--I don't think the substantive stakes are very large here. I will make that more clear in a moment. Go back to the point I made earlier about how bank holding company regulation as a really big deal is unique to the United States. It is a historical quirk of our system. It is something the Federal Reserve got hold of in a context where the Congressional objectives were completely different from what we have now and the Fed was able to expand its authority and make it into a very big deal. Let me actually just make that a bit more clear. The bank holding--there is something in my written statement about this, but the Bank Holding Company Act was passed in 1956 in a populist effort to limit bigness and also to split up some affiliations, like Bank of America and TransAmerica were affiliated at the time. But basically we had--Chairman Wright Patman of the House Banking Committee believed that everything was too big, including $100 million banks, and so he responded with the Bank Holding Company Act. He got trade association support for people who were concerned about banks getting into their business. We are not talking about something that was a safety and soundness statute in its origin. It was a kind of populist antimonopoly statute in its origin. We see safety and soundness come in as a criterion in 1970 as a basis for exceptions on some things. But this was not originally a safety and soundness statute. It was not a statute relating to bank policy. And yet it becomes what my old boss, Jerry Hawk, Under Secretary of the Treasury, said, a matter of theology, where there are people invested in a certain kind of outcome here. And so what they are wanting to do, then, is to conform the existing nonfinancial owners of financial institutions to sort of a very pure version of how they would like things to come out. Now, in fact, nonfinancial institution ownership has saved the taxpayers money. Ford Motor Company put about $1 billion, as I recall, into a thrift institution that had acquired trouble. So there has been positive results. I don't think there have been significant negative results. And this ownership, like General Electric and so forth, was not a source of the current crisis. So the idea of making a big deal out of this is sort of like, as we have seen from some quarters, is sort of like trying to protect us from the Mexican mafia by building a wall on the Canadian border. It is just not related to the major problems.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you for that observation. I want to make the point, I just mentioned to Senator Merkley as he was walking out, I heard him say credit unions. Credit unions are not part of this consideration at all. We are talking about banks. And before we start getting inundated with e-mails and messages from across the country, credit unions, you are OK on this.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let the word go forth from all of this. Senator Corker, any----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","No. I think you have just given evidence as to where the real political clout is.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I referred earlier to sot of a super-OCC, and I realize it is sort of that, what you are proposing. As we have looked at the resolution mechanisms that need to be in place so that we don't have the same kind of problem, I think we all understand part of the reason we had the problems we had was there was no resolution mechanism for highly complex bank holding entities and one of the only solutions was to prop them up artificially. So the OCC has argued strongly to keep in place the ability to use taxpayer monies to prop up institutions that fail. The FDIC, on the other hand, has argued strongly against that. I happen to have fallen on their side of the equation and think that having any institution that is too big to fail creates tremendous problems, and I really appreciate what Paul Volcker has said about that recently. But hand-in-hand with this is the notion of how we resolve--in other words, we have the regulator--how we resolve that. You all have already made a great case for this type of arrangement that you want to have. I don't think there is any point in going down that path anymore. I understand what it is you would like to see happen. But what should we do as a it relates to a resolution mechanism and how should that be set up?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Well, Senator Corker, I couldn't agree with you more that resolving the largest institutions is a critical issue and I am not in favor of propping them up. That is, if we don't resolve them, we basically create two problems. One is we have public utilities if we don't have an ability to resolve them. And we also disadvantage the community and regional institutions. Rather, this whole structure ought to be one that creates sufficient stability and focuses in a professional way on proper supervision so as to minimize burden and increase the ability of all these institutions to support the economy of the United States. And where one of these institutions is not doing its job correctly and it gets into problems, we have to have a private sector component here--this is really a private sector activity--where it fails, and we have to have the ability to fail it without creating a systemic crisis. If we don't have that, I think we also have the danger that these largest institutions end up controlling the economy and the Governmental mechanism, not vice-versa.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Can I throw in a comment? I think Gene is absolutely right and you are right. We don't want to have institutions that are too big to fail. We want to be able to have a mechanism by which they can go bankrupt when they make bad decisions. Otherwise, this is not a good system at all. But realistically, I mean, if an airline goes into bankruptcy, you can still have the planes fly, or if a railroad goes into bankruptcy, you can still have the trains go on the tracks. The trouble with a financial institution is that it may get to a certain point where it really can't function without some kind of funding or some kind of support to keep it going. Now, to some extent, that was the justification for giving money to General Motors. You needed money for the suppliers, and I don't want to get into that case which I don't know the ins and outs of. But clearly, we need a mechanism, whether it is a bankruptcy or a resolution mechanism, that has a certain amount of money available to make sure that you don't just close the doors and people can't get at their money. Now, what is in the Treasury proposal is a sort of open-ended checkbook that somebody can write a check for any amount to prop up an institution. So I think that is--I don't agree with that. I think that Treasury proposal is too open-ended, and I think the House and the Senate need to make sure taxpayers are protected and that they have a control over the purse. But I don't think we can, at the same time, just say, no, we are never going to put taxpayer money in again, because the fact of the matter is we will come into another financial crisis and we will end up putting in a lot of money, and it is better to have a resolution mechanism or a special bankruptcy court that has the resources to let this thing down gently, although letting it down.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Senator, be wary of anyone who puts a lot of stress on the notion that we need a new resolution mechanism. By and large, we had the resolution mechanisms that we needed. I could be a little more specific about that, but just to put it in the perspective. There certainly are some things that could be helpful here, but basically, we had the mechanisms. There were two problems. First, the system had been allowed to go in the direction of internal weakness to such a degree that problems piled up and happened quickly. But mainly----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And how did that happen, by the way?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Well, I mean, we are talking about a decade in which--or more specifically, from about 2002 to 2007 in which market participants became increasingly complacent about credit risk and where regulators were not taking the opportunity to strengthen things like capital standards while the sky was blue and the sun was shining, take advantage of that time to build bank capital up. Those would be some examples of things that could have been done in the context. But the key thing is that most of the laws we needed were already in place, and in the case of something that is a bank or thrift, the Federal Deposit Insurance Act is the model for the world in terms of doing resolution, and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And we used it, but what about in the other examples of how they kind of--I won't name the entities, but our largest entities in the country, what about in those cases?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Well, if you----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","What type of mechanisms existed that we didn't use?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Well, I should emphasize that many of the largest entities in the country are bank holding companies where the biggest part of the firm is the bank. So the law was there available for that. Now, with a bank holding company----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Or the FDIC to come into the bank component itself.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","That is correct, and let me just emphasize that this does not require--it certainly doesn't require a pot of taxpayer money and it doesn't necessarily--FDIC money is not the only thing that is available, because you can--the FDIC needs to satisfy insured deposits. But other creditors can have a haircut applied to their claims and you close the bank one day and it opens the next business day with a new charter, but the same tellers and so forth there. Now, as for the nonbank part of organizations, we do have the bankruptcy courts. There are some changes that would make sense for bankruptcy courts dealing with nonbank financial institutions, for example, to make sure that you can't shop for the court that you think is best, say shop between New York and Delaware or something like that, to make sure that these cases go to judges who have some expertise and some other things to expedite that. But basically, the law is there.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I would like for you, if you would, to schedule some time to come in and talk about some of the tweaks on the bankruptcy side. And again, I just want to point out that in many ways on this regulatory piece, we are looking at sort of rearranging the deck chairs, and I think the suggestions that each of you have made have been very helpful, but even after you make those changes, it is that lack of--it is that procyclical thinking that drove us to where we were. The sun was shining and so we were continuing to do more and more instead of reserving up more. And I still haven't heard of a way--it seems like to me that what we are going to do is create sort of a super-regulatory entity, but we still haven't yet figured out a way to cause them to actually not be procyclical. So again----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","If I could come back to you on that one, Senator, it is a very difficult challenge, and I do not mean to suggest that there is any simple solution to the problem that you--the challenge you pose there. I do emphasize in my testimony the importance of looking at the incentives that regulators have, because the fact is: bank regulators had the tools that they needed, but they did not take action that they could have here. Part of it is a foresight problem, but part of it is also an incentive problem. That is, if you look at it from the standpoint of the particular people making the decisions, what makes sense from their standpoint? Now, in a four-regulator system where there is squabbling over turf, where there is competition for regulatory clientele, it is tougher to look ahead--if you are the person who is looking ahead and said--to take the example--let us go for higher capital standards now, let us raise the standard in terms of your exposure to systemic risk from other institutions. If you look ahead and you are doing the thing that is not considered obvious at the time, you are more open to criticism. And in a multiregulator system, the friction among regulators provides something of a disincentive there. On top of that, where you need to do joint rulemaking with regulators--and that is a requirement under various laws--you know, you run into other ones who say, ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Since you want people to be wary of folks like me that think----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","I do not mean you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Well, you should, because I think you need to have a certain amount of money available. However good a system you set up, a big financial institution is going to get into trouble at some point in the future. That has always been true, and I suspect it is going to be true again. We can improve regulation as much as we like, but somewhere somebody is going to get into trouble again. And I think we need to make sure that we have a mechanism, whether it is--I think it should be a special bankruptcy court. I do not think you can just pick any judge. I mean, this has to be a judge with special expertise. Or you have a resolution mechanism, and there has to be a way-- you know, this is not just FDIC, because this is not just banks. It is financial institutions more generally. And we have to have a way in which we can keep them operating and that they do not bring the rest of the system down while we are doing it. And if we do not set up that now, then you are going to end up--taxpayers are going to cost a lot of money down the road.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","Two points, Senator. One is that these systemic problems are really, by and large, governmental problems. They are not institutional problems. So when you say who is going to be looking out, one of the reasons you want to have somebody with a systemic responsibility for looking for systemic problems--i.e., bubbles--that is independent is because if you look historically, it has really been governmental problems into which institutions are dragged, by and large. The second thing is the point you made and the point that Rick made about a single consolidated regulator being less given to arbitrage and, therefore, more likely to be conservative. To some degree, the proof of the pudding is in Canada and Australia. In both those systems, they are both English-speaking countries with consolidated prudential supervisors, and that is all they did. And in both systems, they were quite conservative as regulators in terms of their institutions. Now, I just came back from Canada. I was up a couple weeks ago and spent some time with their finance minister and their head of the central bank and their bankers. And they will all say that their supervisor was a restraining force on them getting into a lot of the problems that our institutions got into. Senator Reed . Senator Warner.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Chairman, I will not ask a question. I would just like to make a request to the panel, because it is clear that the panel has got a lot of ideas here. As I think I said earlier, I would love to see more specificity about how we can ensure community banks, smaller banks, are inside a single end-to-end regulator, from assessments to less regulatory, less paperwork. What are the protections we could give beyond division, number one? Number two, Senator Corker and I believe that there needs to be expanded resolution authority at least to bank holding companies, with the FDIC, and the FDIC has raised--and I know you have addressed today, but has raised the concern that if they were--if we took away their prudential supervision, would back-up supervision be enough to have them have their pulse on the status of all of the institutions that they might cover in this expanded jurisdiction. So I would love to have some specific suggestions on how we could address that concern. And then, third, obviously, you know, the Federal Reserve will make the point that, as lender of last resort, they still need to keep their hands in this pie in terms of at least with these larger institutions on the bank holding companies. And I think you have made some very--the whole panel has made a number of valid points about the bank holding companies, but I would love--and, again, Martin, you made the comment about the fact that FDIC and the Fed would be on the board. But what are other ways that we could ensure that the Fed, as lender of last resort, would not lose the expertise that they have? Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, gentlemen. I just have one or two quick questions since I have got the opportunity with this panel, which is rare. Going back to the landscape after we adopt a single regulator, at least hypothetically, should the Federal Reserve continue to have any regulatory authority with respect to State member banks if that is all they are doing in the regulatory sphere? Mr. Ludwig.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","I would not think so, Senator. I think there is huge advantage to having, just like companies, entities that do things that they do well and focus on them. I think it is better for oversight for the Congress. I think it is better for the agencies themselves. And I think to Martin Baily's excellent point, monetary policy is so essential in central banking functions. Do we really want our Chairman of the Federal Reserve sitting around thinking about either consumer rules or bank supervision rules? Which are not unimportant, but how much can you do in a day? I think one of the problems we have with CEOs generally is how much can you actually accomplish in a day, and I think that is an enterprise that they should give up.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Another general question is that this is an opportunity, obviously, and a necessity to look across the board in terms of the Federal regulatory structure, and I think not just in concept of how you regulate banks, but the structure itself of the Federal Reserve. As we cut back, presumably, some of their responsibilities, does their present structure still need to remain the same with regional banks located sort of because the way America was in 1930, not 2010? Does anyone have any comments?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","I would not try to defend the location of Federal Reserve banks, including, you know, the old thing about why are there two in Missouri. But I do think the Federal Reserve banks play a valuable role in Federal Reserve policymaking. That is, they are not just regional offices that receive top-down directives from Washington. And I think in monetary policy and in a great many other things, they provide a diversity of perspective that is desirable. I would note, by the way, that where a significant proportion of supervisory personnel are currently located in Reserve banks, that same space could be used, if desired, by employees of the new agency, and you would still have, you know, interaction of proximity there. So I would keep the Reserve banks. I would encourage cross-fertilization like that. I do not think----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ludwig","I think that is an excellent--I mean, a consolidated supervisor does not mean that everything should be in Washington. And, indeed, with the majority of the banks being located everywhere, you would assume there would be substantial regional offices and duty stations really all over the place. But the advantage of being able to filter it back and have cross-fertilization I think is huge.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me ask you if there is a final comment by any of the panelists that you would like to make before I thank you very much and--yes?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carnell","Actually, I would like to say, if I could, some words in favor of a consumer financial protection agency. I support creating a new independent agency. As I would propose, it would have full responsibility for writing rules implementing consumer protection legislation, financial consumer legislation. And I would also agree with the Administration that it should have primary enforcement authority over nonbank lenders. Now, I differ with the Administration on a couple of points. I think it should have only back-up enforcement authority over FDIC-insured banks and their affiliates. I think that is enough. I think that will do the job. And I also do not support slashing the preemptive effect of the National Bank Act. The State regulators had primary responsibility for dealing with nonbank lenders that were the epicenter of predatory lending. They did a poor job, and yet what they talk about is national bank preemption, which was not the practical problem there. On top of that, I point out that the Supreme Court issued a major decision earlier this year, Cuomo v. Clearing House, that cut back on some of the preemptive claims made for the National Bank Act. So I do not think there is a need for action in the preemption area, certainly not what the Administration has proposed. But the agency is a good idea.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, gentlemen, very much for this excellent testimony, and thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Thank you for having us.","Speech"," "
