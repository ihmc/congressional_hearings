"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Let me thank our witnesses for being here this morning, and colleagues as well, and just to notify the room how we will proceed. Again, there are only a handful of us here, but we have eight witnesses, and so we have got a long morning in front of us to go through these issues. And what I would like to do is I will make some opening remarks, turn to Senator Shelby, and then as long as the room does not all of a sudden get crowded with a lot of Members here, I will ask Senator Reed and Senator Bennet if you would like to make a couple of opening comments, and we will get right to our witnesses, who have supplied very thorough testimony. And if they each read all of their testimony, we are going to be here until Friday, in a sense. But it is very, very good and very helpful to us. So we will proceed along those lines and hopefully have a good, engaging morning here on a very, very critical issue. So I welcome all of you to the hearing this morning entitled ``Enhancing Investor Protection and the Regulation of Securities Markets.'' The purpose of today's hearing is to examine what went wrong in the securities markets and to discuss how we can prevent irresponsible practices that led to our financial system seizing up from ever happening again and how to protect investors, including small investors, from getting burned by the kinds of serious abuses and irresponsible behavior that we have seen in certain quarters of the markets in recent years. We are going to hear about proposals to regulate the securities market so that it supports economic growth and protects investors rather than threatens economic stability. As important, today we will begin to chart a course forward--a course that acknowledges how complex products and risky practices can do enormous damage to the heart of our financial system, the American people as well, absent a strong foundation of consumer and investor protections. Half of all U.S. households are invested in some way in securities, meaning the path we choose for regulating this growth and growing segment of our financial system will determine the futures not only of traders on Wall Street but of families, of course, across the country. A year ago this coming Saturday, the collapse of Bear Stearns underscored the importance role that securities play in our financial system today. When I was elected to the Senate in 1980, bank deposits represented 45 percent of the financial assets of the United States and securities represented 55 percent. Today, the securities sector dominates our financial system, representing 80 percent of financial assets, with bank deposits a mere 20 percent. As the securities market has expanded, so, too, has its influence on the lives of average citizens. Much of that expansion has been driven by the process known as ``securitization,'' in which everyday household debt is pooled into sophisticated structures, from mortgages and auto loans to credit cards and student loans. In time, however, Wall Street not only traded that debt, it began to pressure others into making riskier and riskier loans to consumers. And lenders, brokers, and credit card companies were all too willing to comply, pushing the middle-class family in my State of Connecticut and elsewhere across the country who would have qualified for a traditional secure product into a riskier subprime mortgage or giving that 17-year-old college student, who never should have qualified in the first place, a credit card with teaser rates that were irresistible but terms that were suffocating. As one trader said of the notorious subprime lender, they were moving money out of the door to Wall Street so fast, with so few questions asked, these loans were not merely risky, they were, in fact, built to self-destruct. As we knew it, securitization did not reallocate risk. It spread risk throughout our financial system, passing it on to others like a high-stakes game of hot potato. With no incentive to make sure these risky loans paid off down the road, each link in the securitization chain--the loan originators, Wall Street firms and fund managers, with the help of credit rating agencies--generated more risk. They piled on layers of loans into mortgage-backed securities, which were piled into collateralized debt obligations, which were in turn piled into CDO squared and cubed, severing the relationship between the underlying consumer and their financial institutions. Like a top-heavy structure built on shoddy foundations, it all, of course, came crashing down. I firmly believe that had the Fed simply regulated the mortgage lending industry, as Congress directed with the law passed in 1994, much of this could have been averted. But despite the efforts of my predecessor on this Committee, myself, and others over many years, the Fed refused to act. But the failure of regulators was not limited to mortgage- backed securities. As many constituents in Connecticut and elsewhere have told me, auction rate securities, misleadingly marketed as cash equivalents, left countless investors and city pension funds across the country with nothing when the actions failed and the securities could not be redeemed. As this Committee uncovered at a hearing about AIG last week, the unregulated credit derivatives market contributed to the largest quarterly loss in history. In recent months, we have unearthed two massive Ponzi schemes, bilking consumers, investors, charities, and municipal pension funds out of tens of billions of dollars that two separate regulators failed to detect in their examinations. In January, I asked Dr. Henry Backe of Fairfield, Connecticut, to address this Committee about the losses suffered by the employees at his medical practice in the Bernard Madoff fraud. His testimony prompted Senator Menendez and me to urge the IRS to dedicate serious resources to helping victims like Linda Alexander, a 62-year-old telephone operator from Bridgeport, Connecticut, who makes less than $480 a week and lost every penny of her retirement savings. In an instant, the $10,000 she had saved over a lifetime evaporated because regulators has no idea a massive fraud was occurring right under their noses. This crisis is the result of what may have been the greatest regulatory failure in human history. If you need any further evidence, consider this: At the beginning of the credit crisis in 2008, the SEC regulated five investment banks under the Consolidated Supervised Entity Program: Lehman Brothers, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, and Morgan Stanley--names synonymous with America's financial strength, having survived world wars and the Great Depression. And though the seeds of their destruction have been planted nearly a decade ago, each was sold, converted to a bank holding company, or failed outright inside of 6 months--every single one of them. Our task today is to continue our examination of how to begin rebuilding a 21st century financial structure. We do so not from the top down, focusing solely on the soundness of the largest institutions, with the hope that it trickles down to the consumer but, rather, from the bottom up, ensuring a new responsibility in financial services and a tough new set of protections for regular investors who thought these protections were already in place. The bottom-up approach will create a new way of regulating Wall Street. For the securities markets, that means examining everything, from the regulated broker-dealers and their sales practices, to unregulated credit default swaps. It means ensuring that the creators of financial products have as much skin in the game when they package these products as the consumers do when they buy them, so that instead of passing on risk, everyone shares responsibility. And that means we need more transparency from public companies, credit rating agencies, municipalities, and banks. We are going to send a very clear message that these modernization efforts, the era of ``don't ask''--in these modernization efforts, the era of ``don't ask, don't tell'' on Wall Street and elsewhere is over. For decades, vitality, innovation, and creativity have been a source of genius of our system, and I want to see that come back. It is time we recognized transparency and responsibility are every bit as paramount, that whether we are homebuyers, city managers, entrepreneurs, we can only make responsible decisions if we have the accurate and proper information. We want the American people to know that this Committee will do everything in its power to get us out of this crisis by putting the needs of people first, from constituents like Linda Alexander, who I mentioned a moment ago, to millions more whose hard-earned dollars are tied up in our securities markets. Today's hearing will provide an opportunity to hear ideas and build a record upon which this Committee can legislate a way forward for the American people to rebuild confidence in these securities markets, and to put our country back on a sound economic footing. With that, I thank our witnesses again for being here, and let me turn to my colleague, former Chairman, Senator Shelby.","Speech",""
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. I think the greatest challenge in dealing with this financial crisis is understanding its multiple, complex, and interrelated causes. This hearing provides us an opportunity to examine some of the causes that relate to our securities markets and securities regulation. Without presupposing the specific causes of the financial crisis, I think it is appropriate to conclude that a broad failure of risk management in the financial system led us to where we are today. It appears that everybody assumed that someone else was monitoring the risk. Regulators assumed that financial institutions had properly assessed the risk of their own activities or assumed that other regulators were watching what those entities were doing. Financial institutions failed to adequately monitor risks across business units and failed to thoroughly understand the risks associated with new financial products. They did not adequately assess either their exposures to or the health of their counterparties. Very sophisticated investors assumed that someone else had done their due diligence. Less sophisticated investors assumed, unreasonably, that asset prices would only climb. The excessive reliance on credit ratings and the failure of the market to develop a clearinghouse for credit default swaps are just two examples of this widespread market failure. The disastrous consequences of this nearly universal passing of the buck should serve as the guidepost for us and the SEC as we consider reforms. I think there should be clear lines of responsibility for regulators. Only then can Congress hold regulators accountable for their performance. It is also important not to make changes to the statutory and regulatory framework that would further lull market participants into believing that regulators or other market participants are doing their work for them. We cannot build a regulator big enough to be everywhere at all times. Market participants need to do their own due diligence before and after they make an investment decision. They need to bear the costs of an unwise investment, just as they reap the benefit of a wise investment. In the end, I believe our markets will be best served by the combined efforts of diligent regulators and responsible market participants working under rules that are clear and consistent. Uncertainty about the rules impedes the market from working as it should. Ad hoc Government actions lead private capital to sit on the sidelines because a change in rules can radically change a market participant's expected return. A consistent legal framework is an essential component of a competitive capital market. Investors will avoid a market if they believe the rules may change in the middle of the game. A clear example of this dynamic is the world of accounting where many are calling for the suspensions of mark-to-market because of the adverse impact that it is presently having on the books of so many companies. Accounting rules should be designed to ensure that a firm's disclosures reflect economic reality, however ugly that reality may be. Changing the accounting rules now will simply compound investors' wariness about investing in a market where many firms have bad or illiquid assets on their books. I will be interested in hearing from today's witnesses on this topic and how the SEC can improve its efforts to protect our securities markets while also facilitating continued innovation and responsible risk taking. Chairman Dodd, I thank you for calling this hearing. I think you are on to something here.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY"

"Mr. Coffee","Well, good morning, and thank you, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and fellow Senators. I have prepared an overly long, bulky, 70-page memorandum for which I apologize for inflicting on you. It attempts to synthesize a good deal of recent empirical research by business school scholars, finance scholars, and even law professors, about just what went wrong and what can be done about it. I cannot summarize all that, but I would add the following two sentences to what Senators Dodd and Shelby very accurately said at the outset. The current financial crisis is unlike others. This was not a bubble caused by investor mania, which is the typical cause of bubbles. It was not a demand-driven bubble; rather, it was more a supply driven bubble. It was the product of a particular business model, a model known as the ``originate-and-distribute model,'' under which financial institutions, including loan originators, mortgage lenders, and investment banks, all behaved similarly and went to the brink of insolvency and beyond, pursuing a model. What is the key element of this originate-and-distribute model? You make lax loans. You make non-creditworthy loans because--because you do not expect to hold those loans for long enough to matter. You believe that you can transfer these loans to the next link in the transmission chain before you will bear the economic risk. When everyone believes that--and they correctly believed that for a few years--then all standards begin to become relaxed, and we believe that as long as we can get that investment grade rating from the credit rating agencies, we will have no problem, and weak loans can always be marketed. There is no time for statistics here, but let me add just one. Between 2001 and 2006, a relatively short period, some of the data that I cite shows you that low-document loans in these portfolios went from being something like 28 percent in mortgage-backed securities in 2001 to 51 percent in 2006-- doubling in 4 or 5 years. Investment banks and credit rating agencies are not responding to that change. That is the essential problem. This gives rise to what I will call and economists call a ``moral hazard problem,'' and this moral hazard problem was compounded by deregulatory policies that the SEC and other institutions followed that permitted investment banks to increase their leverage dramatically between 2004 and 2006, which is only just a few years ago. This is yesterday we are talking about. They did this pursuant to the Consolidated Supervised Entity Program that you have already been discussing, and it led to the downfall of our five largest, most important investment banks. All right. Essentially, the SEC deferred to self- regulation, by which these five largest banks constructed their own credit risk models, and the SEC deferred to them. The 2008 experience shows, if there ever was any doubt, that in an environment of intense competition and under the pressure of equity-based executive compensation systems that tend to be very short-term oriented, self-regulation alone simply does not work. The simplest way for a financial institution to increase profitability was to increase its leverage, and it did so to the point where they were leveraged to the eyeballs and could not survive the predictable downturn in the economic weather. So what should be done from a policy perspective? Well, here is my first and most essential point: All financial institutions that are too big to fail, which really means too entangled to fail, need to be subjected to prudential financial oversight, what I would call ``financial adult supervision,'' from a common regulator applying a basically common although risk-adjusted standard to all these institutions, whether they are insurance companies, banks, thrifts, hedge funds, money market funds, or even pension plans, or the financial subsidiaries of very large corporations, like GE Capital. In my judgment, this can only be done by the Federal Reserve Board. That is the only person in a position to serve as what is called the ``systemic risk regulator.'' I think we need in this country a systemic risk regulator, and specifically to define what this means, let me say there are five areas where their authority should be established. The Federal Reserve Board should be authorized and mandated to do the following five things: One, establish ceilings on debt-to-equity ratios and otherwise restrict leverage for all major financial institutions. Two, supervise and restrict the design and trading of new financial products, including, in particular, over-the-counter derivatives and including the posting of margin and collateral for such products. Three, mandate the use of clearinghouses. The Federal Reserve has already been doing this, formulating this, trying to facilitate this, but mandating it is more important. And they need the authority to supervise these clearing houses, and also if they judge it to be wise and prudent, to require their consolidation into a single clearinghouse. Four, the Federal Reserve needs the authority to require the writedown of risky assets by financial institutions, regardless of whether accounting rules mandate it. The accountants will always be the last to demand a writedown because their clients do not want it. The regulator is going to have to be more proactive than are the accounting firms. Last, the Federal Reserve should be authorized to prevent liquidity crises that come from the mismatch of assets and liabilities. The simple truth is that financial institutions hold long-term illiquid assets which they finance through short-term paper that they have to roll over regularly, and that mismatch regularly causes problems. Now, under this ``Twin Peaks'' model that I am describing, the systematic risk regulator--presumably, the Federal Reserve--would have broad authority. But the power should not be given to the Federal Reserve to override the consumer protection and transparency policies of the SEC. And this is a co-equal point with my first point, that we need a systemic risk regulator. Too often, bank regulators and banks have engaged in what I would term a ``conspiracy of silence'' to hide problems, lest investors find out, become alarmed, and create a run on the bank. The culture of banking regulators and the culture of securities regulators is entirely different. Bank regulators do not want to alarm investors. Securities regulators understand that sunlight is the best disinfectant. And for the long run, just as Senator Shelby said, we need accounting policies that reveal the ugly truth. We could not be worse off now in terms of lack of public confidence. This is precisely the moment to make everyone recognize what the truth is and not to give any regulator the authority to suppress the truth under the guise of systematic risk regulation. For that reason, I think SEC responsibilities for disclosure, transparency, and accounting should be specially spelled out and exempted from any power that the systematic risk regulator has to overrule other policies. Now, two last points. As a financial technology, asset- based securitization, at least in the real estate field, has decisively failed. I think two steps should be done by legislation to mandate the one policies that I think will restore credibility to this field. First, to restore credibility, sponsors must abandon the originate-and-distribute business model and instead commit to retain at least a portion of the most subordinated tranche, the riskiest assets. Some of them have to be held by the promoter because that is the one signal of commitment that tells the marketplace that someone has investigated these assets because they are holding the weakest, most likely to fail. That would be step one. Step two, we need to reintroduce due diligence into the process, into the securitization process, both for public offerings and for Rule 144A offerings, which are private offerings. Right now Regulation AB deregulated; it does not really require adequately that the sponsor verify the loans, have the loan documentation in its possession, or to have examined the creditworthiness of the individual securities. I think the SEC can be instructed by Congress that there needs to be a reintroduction of stronger due diligence into both the public and the private placement process. Last point. Credit rating agencies are obviously the gatekeeper who failed most in this current crisis. The one thing they do not do that other gatekeepers do do is verify the information they are relying on. Their have their rating methodology, but they just assume what they are told; they do not verify it. I think they should be instructed that there has to be verification either by them or by responsible, independent professionals who certify their results to them. The only way to make that system work and to give it teeth is to reframe a special standard of liability for the credit rating agencies. I believe the Congress can do this, and I believe that Senator Reed and his staff are already examining closely the need for additional legislation for credit rating agencies, and I think they are very much on the right track, and I would encourage them. What I am saying, in closing, is that a very painful period of deleveraging is necessary. No one is going to like it. I think some responsibility should be given to the Federal Reserve as the overall systematic risk regulator, but they should not have authority to in any way overrule the SEC's policies on transparency. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN C. COFFEE, JR., ADOLF A. BERLE PROFESSOR OF LAW, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY LAW SCHOOL"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Professor. Mr. Ryan, welcome.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","Good morning. Thank you for inviting me. I appreciate being here. Our current financial crisis, which has affected nearly every American family, underscores the imperative to modernize our financial regulatory system. Our regulatory structure and the plethora of regulations applicable to financial institutions are based on historical distinctions between banks, securities firms, insurance companies, and other financial institutions--distinctions that no longer conform to the way business is conducted. The negative consequences to the investing public of this patchwork of regulatory oversight are real and pervasive. Investors do not have comparable protections across the same or similar financial products. Rather, the disclosures, standards of care, and other key investor protections vary based on the legal status of the intermediary or the product or service being offered. In light of these concerns, SIFMA advocates simplifying and reforming the financial regulatory structure to maximize and enhance investor protection and market integrity and efficiency. Systemic risk, as Professor Coffee noted, has been at the heart of the current financial crisis. As I have previously testified, we at SIFMA believe that a single, accountable financial markets stability regulator, a systemic regulator, will improve upon the current system. While our position on the mission of the financial markets stability regulator is still evolving, we currently believe that its mission should consist of mitigating systemic risk, maintaining financial stability, and addressing any financial crisis, all of which will benefit the investing public. It should have authority over all markets and market participants, regardless of charter, functional regulator, or unregulated status. It should have the authority to gather information from all financial institutions and markets, adopt uniform regulations related to systemic risk, and act as a lender of last resort. It should probably have a more direct role in supervising systemically important financial organizations, including the power to conduct examinations, take prompt corrective action, and appoint or act as the receiver or conservator of all or part of systemically important organizations. We also believe, as a second step, that we must work to rationalize the broader regulatory framework to eliminate regulatory gaps and imbalances that contribute to systemic risk by regulating similar activities and firms in a similar manner and by consolidating certain financial regulators. SIFMA has long advocated the modernization and harmonization of the disparate regulatory regimes for investment advisory, brokerage, and other financial services in order to promote investor protection. SIFMA recommends the adoption of a ``universal standard of care'' that avoids the use of labels that tend to confuse the investing public and expresses, in plain English, the fundamental principles of fair dealing that individual investors can expect from all of their financial services providers. Such a standard could provide a uniform code of conduct applicable to all financial professionals. It would make clear to all individual investors that their financial professionals are obligated to treat them fairly by employing the same core standards whether the firm is a financial planner, an investment adviser, a securities dealer, a bank, an insurance agency, or any other type of financial service provider. The U.S. is the only jurisdiction that splits the oversight of securities and futures activities between two separate regulatory bodies. We support the merger of the SEC and the CFTC. We believe that the development of a clearinghouse for credit derivatives is an effective way to reduce counterparty credit risk, facilitate regulatory oversight, and, thus, promote market stability. In particular, we strongly support our members' initiative to establish a clearinghouse of CDS, and we are pleased to note that ICE US Trust opened its doors for clearing CDS transactions yesterday. Finally, the current financial crisis reminds us that markets are global in nature, and so are the risks of contagion. To promote investor protection through effective regulation and the elimination of disparate regulatory treatment, we believe that common regulatory standards should be applied consistently across markets. Accordingly, we urge that steps be taken to foster greater cooperation and coordination among regulators in all major markets. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF T. TIMOTHY RYAN, JR., PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much for that. Paul, welcome. It is nice to see you and have you before the Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stevens","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. On behalf of the Institute and our member funds, I thank you, Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and all the Members of the Committee for making it possible for me to appear today. We serve 93 million American investors, as you know, and we strongly commend the Committee for the attention you are devoting to improving our system of financial regulation. I believe the current financial crisis provides a very strong public mandate for Congress and for regulators to take bold steps to strengthen and modernize regulatory oversight. Like other stakeholders, and there are many, of course, we have been thinking hard about how to revamp the current system. Last week, we published a white paper detailing a variety of reforms, and in it we recommend changes to create a regulatory framework that provides strong consumer and investor protection while also enhancing regulatory efficiencies, limiting duplication, closing conspicuous regulatory gaps, and frankly, emphasizing the national character of our financial services markets. I would like briefly to summarize the proposals. First, we believe it is crucial to improve the government's capability to monitor and mitigate risks across the financial system, so ICI supports creation of a Systemic Risk Regulator. This could be a new or an existing agency or interagency body, and in our judgment should be responsible for monitoring the financial markets broadly, analyzing changing conditions here and overseas, evaluating and identifying risks that are so significant that they implicate the health of the financial system, and acting in coordination with other responsible regulators to mitigate these risks. In our paper, we stress the need to carefully define the responsibilities of a Systemic Risk Regulator as well as its relationships with other regulators, and I would say, Mr. Chairman, that is one of the points that Chairman Bernanke made in his speech today, to leverage the expertise and to work closely with other responsible regulators in accomplishing that mission. In our judgment, addressing systemic risk effectively, however, need not and should not mean stifling innovation, retarding competition, or compromising market efficiency. You can achieve all of these purposes, it seems to us, at the same time. Second, we urge the creation of a new Capital Markets Regulator that would combine the functions of the SEC and the CFTC. This Capital Markets Regulator's statutory mission should focus sharply on investor protection and law enforcement. It should also have a mandate, as the SEC does currently, to consider whether its proposed regulations promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. We suggest several ways to maximize the effectiveness of the new Capital Markets Regulator. In particular, we would suggest a need for a very high-level focus on management of the agency, its resources, and its responsibilities, and also the establishment of mechanisms to allow it to stay much more effectively abreast of market and industry developments. Third, as we discuss more fully in our white paper, effective oversight of the financial system and mitigation of systemic risk will require effective coordination and information sharing among the Systemic Risk Regulator and regulators responsible for other financial sectors. Fourth, we have identified areas in which the Capital Markets Regulator needs more specific legislative authority to protect investors and the markets by closing regulatory gaps and responding to changes in the marketplace. In my written statement, I identify four such areas: hedge funds, derivatives, municipal securities, particularly to improve disclosure standards, and the inconsistent regulatory regimes that exist today for investment advisors and broker dealers. Now, as for mutual funds, they have not been immune from the effects of the financial crisis, nor, for that matter, have any other investors. But our regulatory structure, and this bears emphasizing, which grew out of the New Deal as a result of the last great financial crisis, has proven to be remarkably resilient, even through the current one. Under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and other securities laws, fund investors enjoy a range of vital protections: Daily pricing of fund shares with mark-to-market valuation every business day; separate custody of all fund assets; minimal or no use of leverage in our funds; restrictions on affiliated transactions and other forms of self-dealing; required diversification; and the most extensive disclosure requirements faced by any financial products. Funds have embraced this regulatory regime and they have prospered under it. Indeed, I think recent experience suggests that policymakers should consider extending some of these very same disciplines that have worked so well for us since 1940 to other marketplace participants in reaction to the crisis that we are experiencing today. Finally, let me comment, Mr. Chairman, briefly on money market funds. Last September, immediately following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, a single money market fund was unable to sustain its $1 per share net asset value. Coming hard on the heels of a series of other extraordinary developments that roiled global financial markets, these events worsened an already severe credit squeeze. Investors wondered what other major financial institution might fail next and how other money market funds might be affected. Concern that the short-term fixed income market was all but frozen solid, the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department took a variety of initiatives, including the establishment of a temporary guarantee program for money market funds. These steps have proved highly successful. Over time, investors have regained confidence. As of February, assets in money market funds were at an all-time high, almost $3.9 trillion. The Treasury Department's temporary guarantee program will end no later than September 18. Funds have paid more than $800 million in premiums, yet no claims have been made and we do not expect any claims to be made. We do not envision any future role for Federal insurance of money market fund assets and we look forward to an orderly transition out of the temporary guarantee program. The events of last fall were unprecedented, but it is only responsible that we, the fund industry, look for lessons learned. So in November 2008, ICI formed a working group of senior fund industry leaders to study ways to minimize the risk to money market funds of even the most extreme market conditions. That group will issue a strong and comprehensive set of recommendations designed, among other things, to enhance the way money funds operate. We expect that report by the end of the month. We hope to place the executive summary in the record of this hearing, and Mr. Chairman, I would be delighted to return to the Committee, if it is of interest to you, to present those recommendations at a future date. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF PAUL SCHOTT STEVENS, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INVESTMENT COMPANY INSTITUTE"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much for that. We will welcome that addition to the Committee record, as well. Professor Bullard, thank you very much for joining us.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bullard","Thank you, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee for the opportunity to appear here today. I congratulate the Committee for its thorough and deliberate investigation into the causes of the current financial crisis. Recent events have provided useful lessons on the management of systemic risk, prudential regulation, and investor protection in the investment management industry. The performance of stock and bond mutual funds, for example, has demonstrated the remarkable resiliency of the investment company structure in times of stress. As equity values have plummeted, most shareholders and stock funds have stood their ground, notwithstanding that they have the right to redeem their shares at short notice at their NAVs. There is no scientific explanation for the stability of mutual funds during this crisis, but I believe it is related to this redemption right, as Paul was describing a moment ago. Mutual fund investors are confident that they will receive the net asset value of their holdings upon redemption and they appear to believe that the net asset value of those shares--the net asset value will be fair and accurate. This confidence in the valuation and redeemability of mutual fund shares reduces the likelihood of the kind of panic selling that creates systemic risk and may provide a useful lesson for the regulation of other financial intermediaries. The current crisis has exposed certain investor protection issues, however. Many investors in target date and short-term bond funds have experienced investment returns that are not consistent with returns typical of that asset class. If a fund uses the name Target Date 2010, for example, its equity allocation should fall within the generally expected range for someone on the brink of retirement. Similarly, a 529 plan option that is touted as appropriate for a 16-year-old should not lose 40 percent of its value 2 years before the money will be needed for college. Investors should be free to choose more aggressive asset allocations than those normally considered most appropriate for this situation. But funds that use a name that most investors will assume reflects a particular strategy should be required to invest consistent with that strategy. In contrast with other types of mutual funds, the performance of money market funds has raised systemic and prudential regulation concerns. Money market funds constitute a major linchpin in our payment system and therefore a run on these funds poses significant systemic risk. The management of this risk has been inadequate, as demonstrated by the recent run on money market funds following the failure of the reserve primary fund. There are important lessons to be learned from this experience, but not the lessons that some commentators have found. The Group of 30, for example, has recommended that the money market franchise be eliminated. Former Fed Chairman Volcker explained that if money market funds are going to talk like a bank and squawk like a bank, they ought to be regulated like a bank. The problem with this argument is that money market funds don't fail like banks. Since 1980, more than 3,000 U.S. banks have failed, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars. During the same period, two money market funds have failed, costing taxpayers zero dollars. I agree that a regulatory rearrangement is in order, but it is banks that should be regulated more like money market funds. Banks routinely fail because they invest in risky, long-term assets while money market funds invest in safe, short-term assets. Insuring bank accounts may be necessary to protect against the systemic risk that a run on banks poses to the payment system, but there is no good reason why banks should be permitted to invest insured deposits in anything other than the safest assets. And there is no good reason why money market funds that pose the same systemic risk to our payment system should be left uninsured. I note, Chairman Dodd, you may have picked up this morning on Chairman Bernanke's comments that some kind of interim insurance program may be an appropriate response to the crisis, and I have to disagree with Paul that the program will necessarily end in September. I posted an article on SSRN that deals with one thesis of how to approach money market fund insurance and I hope the Committee and staff will take a look at that. The current crisis has also exposed significant weaknesses in hedge fund and investment advisor regulation. For example, hedge funds are permitted to sell investments to any person with a net worth of at least $1 million, a minimum that has not been adjusted since 1982. This means that a hedge fund is free to sell interest to a recently retired couple that owns a $250,000 house and has $750,000 in investments, notwithstanding that their retirement income is likely to be around $35,000 a year before Social Security. Finally, the Madoff scandal has again reminded us of the risks of the SEC's expansive interpretation of the broker exclusion from the definition of investment advisor. It appears that Madoff did not register as an investment advisor in reliance on the SEC's position that managing discretionary accounts could somehow be viewed as solely incidental to related brokerage services. This over-broad exclusion left Madoff subject only to broker regulation, which failed to uncover this fraud. The SEC has since rescinded its ill-advised position on discretionary accounts, but it continues to read the ``solely incidental'' exception so broadly as to leave thousands of brokers who provide individualized investment advice subject only to a broker's suitability obligation. These brokers should be subject to the same fiduciary duties that other investment advisors are subject to, including the duty to disclose revenue sharing payments and other compensation that create a potential conflict with their clients' interests. And finally, I would just add to the comments on the question of systemic or prudential regulator. I agree with Professor Coffee's comments that there is something simply fundamentally inconsistent with the SEC's investor protection role and the prudential role that it has not served particularly well in recent times and that those roles should be separated. I agree that there should be a Federal Prudential Regulator, which is what I would call it, that oversees all of those similar characteristics, such as net capital rules, money market fund rules, banking regulations that share those prudential or systemic risk concerns. It is not clear to me, however, that the particular types of liabilities that insurance companies hold would be suitable for one common prudential regulator, but that is something we don't necessarily need to consider unless the Federalizing of insurance regulation begins to make additional progress. And I would also add that we need to keep in mind that there is a significant difference between customer protection and investor protection. I think when Paul was talking about a Capital Markets Regulator, the way I would think of capital markets as being a way of talking about a regulator as investor protection regulator, which would serve fundamentally different functions, especially in that it embraces risk and looks to the full disclosure of that risk as its principal objective as opposed to what might be viewed as customer protection, which is really to ensure that promised services are what are delivered in a fully disclosed and honest way. These and other issues are addressed in greater detail in my written submission. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MERCER E.

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. Mr. Pickel, we thank you for joining the Committee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Pickel","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Shelby and Members of the Committee. Thank you for inviting ISDA to testify here today. We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss the privately negotiated derivatives business, and more specifically, the credit default swaps market. I have submitted written testimony, and as you noted, Mr. Chairman, it is a lengthy submission and so I would like to summarize some of the key remarks that I included in that testimony. I think first and foremost, we need to understand that the benefits of the OTC derivatives business are significant for the American economy and American companies. They manage a broad range of risk using these instruments that are not central to their businesses, allowing them to manage these financial risks typically so that they can focus on the business that they run. So a borrower borrowing on a floating basis can use an interest rate swap to manage its exposure to exchange fixed for floating obligations. Currency exposure--many companies have significant operations around the world and have significant currency exposure and use currency swaps, OTC currency swaps, to manage that risk. ISDA itself uses currency swaps to manage its overseas exposure. Commodity exposure--airlines have significant exposure to fuel costs and they typically look to utilize OTC derivatives to manage that exposure. And finally, credit exposure--using credit derivatives, credit default swaps, exposure to suppliers or to customers where credit is a significant concern, companies can use these products to help manage that risk. These products also create efficiencies in pricing and wider availability of credit, particularly credit default swaps. They facilitate lending at lower rates, and they are critical to have available, and have them widely available, as we come out of this recession. I think they will be an important part of the ability of firms to manage credit risk as they look at these important credit issues that we face in this financial crisis. As far as the role of the credit default swaps and OTC derivatives generally in the financial crisis, first of all, I think, and this Committee has certainly heard testimony, the fundamental source of the crisis is imprudent lending, particularly in the U.S. housing sector, but extending to other markets, as well, credit cards and commercial lending as an example. We must distinguish between the credit default swap business and the collateralized debt obligation business. There has been reference to the originate to distribute model. That certainly applies to the securitization process and to the CDO process. In the credit default swap business, a company, a bank that has lent money may use a credit default swap to hedge its exposure on that credit. In that process, it will be maintaining its lending relationship with the borrower and it will also be taking on credit risk and paying a fee to the company that is selling protection. So it is distinctly different from the originate to distribute model. We certainly have heard testimony, and this Committee heard testimony last week on the AIG situation. I think we need to spend some time and this organization needs to spend some time talking about that. AIG obviously was significantly involved in credit default swaps. It was the means by which it took risk. But we must understand the poor choices, the adverse policies, and the misunderstood risk that were involved there, and this Committee heard a lot about that in the testimony last week, particularly from Mr. Polakoff from the Office of Thrift Supervision. These were the source of their problems, these misunderstood risks and poor decisions. They were contrary to the best practices in the industry and to the experiences of swap market participants for the past 20 years. The fundamental decision that AIG made was to take on exposure to the housing market. They did that, yes, via credit default swaps. They also did that, as the Committee heard last week, in other means, as well, through their securities lending business, in which they actually continued to lend and take exposure to those markets into 2006 and 2007, when the worst of these securities were generated through the lending process. They also had a very myopic view of loss. They were only looking at the payout potential, the possibility they would actually have to pay out on these transactions. There was no consideration of the implications of the mark-to-market losses that they could face and to the effects on their capital and their liquidity. They seem to have completely ignored the possible effects of that. They relied on their AAA rating and refused to provide collateral from the start of their trading relationships. It takes away the discipline that collateral provides in that trading relationship. Collateral is extensively used in the OTC derivatives business to help manage risk and also introduce discipline to the trading relationship. They agreed, on the other hand, to provide collateral on the downgrade of their credit rating. That led to a falling off of a cliff, effectively, leading to substantial liquidity problems which eventually led to the decision to intervene. So yes, these decisions and policies are important to understand and we need to take steps to make sure that this does not happen again, but those relate to the decisions they made and not to the products themselves. The products, in fact, have performed as the parties intended. In fact, just yesterday, the Senior Supervisors Group, which is a group of senior supervisors from the G-7 countries, talked about how the CDS product had performed multiple times over the course of last fall and into this year in helping to settle transactions, credit default swaps that parties had engaged in, and they acknowledged that this process has been extremely effective. And then finally, this is a very important week in the credit default swap market. I believe Mr. Ryan referred earlier to the fact that one of the clearinghouses that has been talked about for many, many months has now actually begun to clear transactions, and that is a very significant development. And later this week, ISDA itself will introduce some changes to the standard contract that will facilitate the settlement of these trades in the future and will also facilitate moving more transactions onto a clearinghouse. So that is a very important development. There is much to be done by ISDA, by the industry, in close consultation with this Committee and other committees in Congress as well as the regulators here in the United States and globally and we are committed to be engaged in that process. We look forward to working with you as you analyze the causes of this financial crisis, and based on that analysis, consider changes to our regulatory structure with a goal to obtaining greater transparency, greater disclosure, and greater coordination among regulators. Thank you again for your time, and I look forward to your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ROBERT PICKEL, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much, Mr. Pickel. Damon Silvers. Damon, it is good to have you with us. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Good morning, Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby. Thank you for inviting me here today. Before I begin, I would like to note that in addition to my role as Associate General Counsel of the AFL-CIO, I am the Deputy Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel created by the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 to oversee the TARP. While I will describe in my testimony aspects of the Congressional Oversight Panel's report on regulatory reform, my testimony reflects my views alone and the views of the AFL-CIO unless otherwise noted and is not on behalf of the panel, its staff, or its chair. The vast majority of American investors participate in the markets as a means to secure a comfortable retirement and to send their children to college, as you noted, Mr. Chairman, in your opening remarks. While the spectacular frauds like the Madoff Ponzi scheme have generated a great deal of publicity, the bigger question is what changes must be made to make our financial system a more reasonable place to invest the hard- earned savings of America's working families. Today, I will address this larger question at three levels: Regulatory architecture, regulating the shadow markets and the challenge of jurisdiction, and certain specific steps Congress and regulators should take to address holes in the investor protection scheme. First, with respect to regulatory architecture, the Congressional Oversight Panel in its special report on regulatory reform observed that addressing issues of systemic risk cannot be a substitute for a robust, comprehensive system of routine financial regulation. Investor protection within this system should be the focus of a single agency within the broader regulatory framework. That agency needs to have the stature and independence to protect the principles of full disclosure by market participants and compliance with fiduciary duties among market intermediaries. This has been noted by several of the panelists prior to me. This mission is in natural tension with bank regulators' mission of safeguarding the safety and soundness of the banks they regulate, and that natural tension would apply to a Systemic Risk Regulator that was looking more broadly at safety and soundness issues. Because of these dynamics, effective investor protection requires that any solution to the problem of systemic risk prevention should involve the agency charged with investor protection and not supercede it. I have a more detailed document on issues associated with creating a Systemic Risk Regulator that I will provide the Committee following the hearing. I should just note that in relation to this, it is my belief that more of a group approach to systemic risk regulation rather than designating the Fed as the sole regulator would be preferable. Among the reasons for this are the issues of information sharing and coordination that other panelists raised, but most importantly, the fact that the Federal Reserve in its regulatory role fundamentally works through the regional Fed banks, which are fundamentally self-regulatory in nature. Several of the prior witnesses have mentioned some of the problems with self-regulation on critical issues. Furthermore, a Systemic Risk Regulator, as we have learned through the TARP experience, is likely to have to expend public dollars in extreme circumstances. It is completely inappropriate for that function to be vested in a body that is at all self-regulatory. While the Fed could be changed, its governance could be changed to make it fully a public agency, that would have implications, I believe, for the Fed's independence in its monetary policy role. Now, we have already in the Securities and Exchange Commission a regulator focused on investor protection. Although the Commission has suffered in recent years from diminished jurisdiction and leadership failure, the Commission remains an extraordinary government agency whose human capital and market expertise needs to be built upon as part of a comprehensive strategy for effective re-regulation of the capital markets. This point flows right into the issue of jurisdiction and the shadow markets. The financial crisis we are currently experiencing is directly connected to the degeneration of the New Deal system of comprehensive financial regulation into a Swiss cheese regulatory system where the holes, the shadow markets, grew to dominate the regulated markets. The Congressional Oversight Panel specifically observed that we need to regulate financial products and institutions, in the words of President Obama, ``for what they do and not what they are.'' The Congressional Oversight Panel's report further stated that shadow institutions should be regulated by the same regulators that currently have jurisdiction over their regulated counterparts. So, for example, the SEC should have jurisdiction over derivatives that are written using public debt or equity securities as their underlying asset. At a minimum, the panel stated, hedge funds should also be regulated by the SEC in their role as money managers. There is a larger point here, though. Financial re- regulation will be utterly ineffective if it turns into a series of rifle shots at the particular mechanisms used to evade regulatory structures in earlier boom and bust cycles. What is needed is a return to the jurisdictional philosophy that was embodied in the founding statutes of Federal securities regulation: Very broad, flexible jurisdiction that allowed the Commission to follow changing financial market practices. If you follow this principle, the SEC should have jurisdiction over anyone over a certain size who manages public securities and over any contract written that references publicly traded securities. Applying this principle would require at least shifting the CFTC's jurisdiction over financial futures to the SEC, if not merging the two agencies under the SEC's leadership, as I gather some of my fellow panelists believe is necessary. Moving on to substantive reforms, beyond regulating the shadow markets, the Congress and the Securities and Exchange Commission need to act to shape a corporate governance and investor protection regime that is favorable to long-term investors and to the channeling of capital to productive purposes. First, strong boards of publicly traded companies that the public invests in--having strong boards requires meaningful accountability to long-term investors. The AFL-CIO urges Congress to work with the SEC to ensure that long-term investors can nominate and elect psychologically independent directors to company boards through access to the corporate proxy. Second, effective investor protection requires comprehensive executive pay reform involving both disclosure governance and tax policy around two concepts. Equity-linked pay should be held significantly beyond retirement. And two, pay packages as a whole should reflect a rough equality of exposure to downside risk as well as to upside gain. Part of this agenda must be a mechanism for long-term shareholders to advise companies on their executive pay packages in the form of an advisory vote. Finally, Congress needs to address the glaring hole in the fabric of investor protection created by the Central Bank of Denver and Stoneridge cases. These cases effectively granted immunity from civil liability to investors for parties such as investment banks and law firms that are actual co-conspirators in securities frauds. Now, to address very briefly the international context, the Bush administration fundamentally saw the internationalization of financial markets as a pretext for weakening U.S. investor protections. That needs to be replaced by a commitment on the part of the Obama administration, the Congress, and the regulators to building a strong global regulatory floor in coordination with the world's other major economies. However, Congress should not allow the need for global coordination to be an impediment or a prerequisite to vigorous action to re- regulate U.S. financial markets and institutions. Obviously, this testimony simply sketches the outline of an approach and notes some key substantive steps for Congress and the administration to take. While I do not speak for the Oversight Panel, I think I am safe in saying that the Panel is honored to have been asked to assist Congress in this effort and is prepared to assist this Committee in any manner the Committee finds useful. I can certainly make that offer on behalf of the AFL-CIO. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DAMON A. SILVERS, ASSOCIATE GENERAL COUNSEL, AFL- CIO"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Mr. Doe, we thank you for joining us, the Municipal Market Advisors.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Doe","Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and Committee Members, is a distinct pleasure that I come before you today to share my perspective on the municipal bond market. My firm, Municipal Market Advisors, has served for the past 15 years as the leading independent research and data provider to the industry. In addition, from 2003 to 2005, I served as a public member of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, the self- regulatory organization of the industry established by Congress in 1975. There are nearly 65,000 borrowers in the municipal market that are predominantly States and local governments. Recent figures identify an estimated $2.7 trillion in outstanding municipal debt. This is debt that aids our communities in meeting budgets and financing society's essential needs, whether it is building a hospital, constructing a school, ensuring clean drinking water, or sustaining the safety of America's infrastructure. A distinctive characteristic of the municipal market is that many of those who borrow funds--rural counties and small towns--are only infrequently engaged in the capital markets. As a result, there are many issuers of debt who are inexperienced when entering a transaction and are unable to monitor deals that may involve movement of interest rates of the value of derivative products. According to The Bond Buyer, the industry's trade newspaper, annual municipal bond issuance was $29 billion in 1975; whereas, in 2007, issuance peaked at $430 billion. In the past 10 years, derivatives have proliferated as a standard liability management tool for many local governments. However, because derivatives are not regulated, it is exceptionally difficult, if not impossible, to identify the degree of systemic as well as specific risk to small towns and counties who have engaged in complex swaps and derivative transactions. Municipal issuers themselves sought to reduce borrowing costs in recent years by selling bonds with a floating rate of interest, such as auction rate securities. Because States and local governments do not themselves have revenues that vary greatly with interest rates, these issuers employed interest rate swaps to hedge their risk. Issuers use the instruments to transform their floating risk for a fixed-rate obligation. A key factor in the growth of the leverage and derivative structures was the prolific use of bond insurance. Municipal issuers are rated along a conservative rating scale, resulting in much lower ratings for school districts and States than for private sector financial and insurance companies. So although most States and local governments represent very little default risk to the investor, the penal ratings scale encouraged the use of insurance for both cash and derivatives in order to distribute products to investors and facilitate issuer borrowing. So instead of requiring more accurate ratings, the municipal industry chose to use bond insurance to enhance the issuer's lower credit rating to that of the higher insurance company's rating. The last 18 months have exposed the risks of this choice when insurance company downgrades, and auction rate security failures, forced numerous leveraged investors to unwind massive amounts of debt into an illiquid secondary market. The consequence was that issuers of new debt were forced to pay extremely high interest rates and investors were confused by volatile evaluations of their investments. The 34-year era of the municipal industry's self-regulation must come to an end. Today, the market would be in a much better place if: First, the regulator were independent of the financial institutions that create the products and facilitate issuers' borrowing. Municipal departments represent a relatively small contribution to a firm's revenue, and this inhibits MSRB board members from seeking regulatory innovation. Second, if the regulator were integrated into the national regime of regulation. Since the crisis began, we have discovered a limited market knowledge here in D.C., in the Federal Reserve, Treasury, Congress, and the SEC. I might add that when the crisis began to emerge in August 2007, we were immediately contacted by the New York Federal Reserve and the Federal Reserve itself, and are quite impressed in the last 18 months with their vigilance and interest in this sector. So integration, we believe, would speed market recovery by the shared information. Third, the regulator's reach and authority needs to be extended to all financial tools and participants of the municipal transaction. This meant ratings agencies, insurers, evaluators, and investment and legal advisors for both the cash and swaps transactions. This need has become more apparent as we uncover the damaged issuers, and States such as Alabama, Tennessee, and Pennsylvania are suffering relative to interest rate swaps. Fourth, if the regulator were charged with more aggressively monitoring market data with consumers' interests in mind. When I think of consumers, I think of both investors and the issuers. In 2008, there were specific instances of meaningful transactions and price irregularities that should have prompted regulatory investigation to protect consumers. The good news is that this new era of regulatory oversight can be funded by the MSRB's annual revenue in 2008 of $20-plus million, collected from the bond transactions themselves, and can be staffed by the current MSRB policy and administrative infrastructure. I should be clear. The innovations of derivatives and swaps have a useful application and have been beneficial for those for which they are appropriate. However, it is also important that these instruments become transparent and regulated with the same care as the corresponding municipal cash market. It is critical to get this right. There is simply too much at stake. Thank you for having me here today, and I look forward to participating in the questions of the session.","Statement","STATEMENT OF THOMAS DOE, CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MUNICIPAL MARKET ADVISORS"

"Mr. Turner","Thank you, Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby.

"Chairman Dodd","Yes, let me make that clear. There is a lot of additional documentation, and some of you may want to add as well, and so all of that will be included as part of the record. We thank you for that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Turner","It is only 17 pages, so it is a little bit quicker read than Professor Coffee's. Senator Dodd, I think you are right. There are really three root causes of this problem: people made bad loans, gatekeepers sold out, and a lack of regulation or regulators missing in action, quite frankly. And it is not the first time. As an auditor in the Southwest, in Denver, I lived through this with the S&Ls, had to do restructurings, workouts at that point in time. And those issues were all existent then, and we are back to a repeat. So, as Mr. Doe and Mr. Silvers indicated, I think it is especially important that this go-round the Committee get it right. I know that there is some push to try to get something done by an August recess. I would say it is more important to hit this target. We have seen the markets are serviced, a trustee of two large institutional investors. We have seen legislation come out that has not instilled that confidence to date. And we need to get it right this time so we instill that confidence and do not see a market of 5,000, quite frankly. So I would ask you to take your time, whatever is necessary, sooner better than late, but I am not sure this is one that can be both fast and right. Senator Shelby, you asked someone to comment on the mark- to-market accounting. Being the one accountant, the one green eyeshade on this, let me say I could not agree more with you. The mark-to-market accounting that we are debating now is the same issue we debated two decades ago during the S&L crisis, and as the 1991 GAO report stated, the failure of the banks and the S&Ls during that travesty, to turn around, take marks down in a timely manner resulted in lax regulator action, people not getting on top of managing the assets and problems quick enough, and contributed to a significant increase in the cost to the taxpayers of that bailout. And so I would again urge you to push for transparency here, not step on those accounting standards, and let us get the real numbers. When you look at banks like Citigroup, who are trading at a stock price for less than what you can buy a Happy Meal these days at McDonald's, we know that the market clearly is not viewing those financials as credible, and we need to get that credibility back into the system. Certainly, as my fellow panelists mentioned, there are also gaps in regulation. Without a doubt, the credit derivatives market--we all know about that. You certainly have all heard about that as recently as this last week. But it was not so much the failure of a regulatory system, although things need to be fixed, as it was a failure of regulators to act. The Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the SEC, both had risk management offices. The Federal Reserve had examiners day in, day out at Citigroup, and this was not the first time Citigroup became, for all practical purposes, insolvent and in need of a bailout. When I was at the Commission two decades ago, the exact same thing happened. And you ask, How can the Fed turn around and allow that to happen? I remember being in a meeting with banking regulators and the Chairman of the Fed some time ago, and I was asked, along with the Chairman of the SEC at the time, What is wrong if the banks are allowed to fudge the numbers a little bit? Now I think we know. If you turn around and ask me is that who you are going to make our systemic regulator, I would turn around and say, ``I would hope not.'' Rather, I think the notion that Professor Goldsmith, the former SEC Commissioner, has advocated as the council or commission--I think Damon talked on it as well--is a much better approach. You have got to give us this in investors, someone regulating that we can trust in. The notion of prudential supervision needs to be a notion that dies. What we want is actual regulators doing their job. That is what we are turning around and paying them for. Now, while certainly the SEC has fallen off the track here recently, I must say that over the years it has been very successful in its mission to protect investors and gain their confidence. I think investors would be ill served and very concerned if some other regulator with a mission other than investor and consumer protection, first and foremost, was given that leading role to protect them. As the Committee crafts a solution, I simply believe a focus on a systemic regulator in and of itself and doing regulation around just a systemic regulator does not get the job done. I think a more comprehensive single bill is the right way to go after that. And in doing so, I think you should focus on a few key principles that you need to ensure are established: independence in the system, transparency, accountability, enforcement of law, and making sure those responsible for doing the job have adequate resources. Following these key principles, as more specifically spelled out in the written statement, I think there needs to be a closure of the regulatory gaps such as with credit derivatives; SEC oversight over the investment banks; certainly the mortgage brokers who brought this problem upon us; greater accountability established through governance and investor rights, including private right of actions, as Damon has mentioned, for credit rating agencies; assisting others in the commission of fraud. Regulators simply cannot do it all and will never have enough resources, so we have to give institutional investors a chance to get justice and recover money when there has been fraud involved. We need to enhance transparency and disclosure, not only by the issuers but also by the regulators. The testimony last week where the Fed would not give us the names and the details behind the credit derivatives and who are really getting bailed out at AIG was most concerning and disappointing. There needs to be improvements in self-regulation, and there obviously needs to be better enforcement of the laws and regulation. But in the end, no agency here, neither the CFTC, SEC, the banking regulators, can do it without adequate resources. For example, the Office of Compliance and Inspections at the SEC, you are asking them to inspect 16,000 mutual funds, 11,000-plus investment advisers with 440 people. It simply cannot be done. At a minimum, the SEC needs $100 million to get the type of technology that just brings them up to what we use on the street in the market. If they do not even have those tools, there is no way they can supervise and stay on top of it--$100 million in technology, and then they need about another $85, $90 million, just to bring staffing up to the levels they were 4 to 5 years ago. And they need it now. They do not need it on October 1 of 2010. That needs to go into the budget now, not a year and a half from now. So I would certainly urge--and I know this is not the Appropriations Committee, but I would certainly urge the Senate to find a way to get them the resources. Without that, you are asking them to go into a gunfight with an empty gun, and we all know what happens then. So, with that, I will close and be happy to answer any questions. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you very much, Mr. Turner, and what I will do in terms of time--and I will not rigidly hold people to it, obviously, but try and do 5 or 6 minutes, and it will give us a chance at least to get a round. If you go over that, don't worry about it so much. We will just try to move along, because, again, we want to get our witnesses involved. The temptation here is to focus on sort of one aspect of this. There are a lot of issues, obviously, across the spectrum from obviously credit default swaps, transparency, corporate governance issues, conflicts of interest, credit rating agencies--just a lot of matters to pick out, so I am going to try and ask a broader question and then ask each one of you to comment on a broader question. And I think I know the answer to this one, having listened to all of you and I looked at your testimony. But I would like to ask, beginning with you, Dr. Coffee--and I think you identified this. But if you could make one recommendation as we are looking at this--and obviously we have got our hands full here in the coming weeks. By the way, I take the point that was raised, either by Mr. Doe or Mr. Turner, of getting this right and, obviously, there is a sense of urgency, but I think the Committee would agree that we want to get it done, we want to work at this very hard, but we do want to get it right. And so striking that balance between moving with some haste but not to such a degree that that becomes the goal rather than producing a product here that has been well thought out. But if you could make one recommendation that you feel is the most important legislative or regulatory action that the Committee could take to improve investment protection or the quality of securities regulation in the light of the financial crisis we are experiencing, what would it be? What is your one recommendation for us? Just go down the line.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I would tell you that you should endorse----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I need that microphone on.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I would tell you that is the twin peaks model for securities regulation, that is, having separate peaks--one, the systematic risk regulator, the prudential supervisor. I do not think the SEC is the best agency for that. By training or culture, it is a lawyer-dominated agency focused on enforcement and disclosure, which it does well. It is not able to deal with financial institutions, at least in terms of its first-line responsibilities. Someone else can do that better, presumably the Federal Reserve. But as was said by other people today, I think there is always the danger that the cultures of securities and banking regulation are so different, and if you put them all in one agency, the centralized regulator, much like the British model, the FSA, you are going to have tensions and tradeoffs between investor protection and the protection of bank solvency. Thus, I think you have to have a separate investor protection agency. You could merge the SEC and the CFTC, or you could transfer financial futures to the SEC. That is going to be costly in terms of the political process. I do not know whether it is feasible. But the first step, I would say, is to try to have a systematic risk regulator and to not give it the authority to override the disclosure regulators on questions of accounting or on investor protection. So that is the structural issue from 40,000 feet, and I would start there.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Gene Ludwig I have talked to, and he has talked about a similar twin peaks structure that you have just described. Are you familiar with his thoughts on this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","Well, this term ``twin peaks'' has been used by a number of people. Around the world we see two models: the centralized regulator, which is what the U.K. has, and it has not worked that well there, either; and we have the twin peaks models which Australia, the Netherlands, and other countries have. We in the U.S. have a unique fragmented system that is virtually Balkanized, with a different regulator for every class of institution. We have got to move one of those two, and I am telling you that the twin peaks model, I think, is vastly superior.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","OK. I agree with you. Tim Ryan.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","This is unique. We basically agree with the professor. I mean, we have not worked out most of the details on both aspects of the twin peak, but we know that the No. 1 recommendation we have today--and actually, the country needs it. We need confidence in the system. There is no confidence today. We need a systemic risk regulator for the major institutions, and we would urge you to do that in a timely fashion. And we would define ``timely'' by the end of this year, and to do it right. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Stevens.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stevens","We, as you know, endorse with some cautions the idea of a systemic risk regulator, but if you push me to say what one thing, Mr. Chairman, I would say that we need a capital markets regulator that is really at the top of its game. This problem would not have grown unless the securities markets made available, through packaging and reselling and all the rest of it, a vast opportunity to take these mortgages and distribute them to financial institutions globally. I in 30 years have been a close observer of the SEC, and I think it is a remarkable agency. But it has seen challenges in keeping up with the growth and the complexity and the linkages, the internationalization of our capital markets. What we need to do is give it the right tools, give it the right range of authority, and make sure there is a very strong management focus there that keeps it on its mission. And I agree with you, investor protection is mission one, but it also has a very important regulatory role, and so it needs to understand and be able to keep pace with these market changes in the way that has, I think, proven to be very, very difficult. So that would be my recommendation.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","OK. Professor Bullard.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bullard","Mine would be to--probably to expand on what Professor Coffee was saying, I think that from an investor protection point of view, what is important to understand is that investor protection actually assumes that we want investors to take risk. And, therefore, investor protection is about making sure that the risks that they take are consistent with their expectations. That is fundamentally inconsistent with a prudential oversight role. Prudential oversight is what you want when somebody buys life insurance and expects the money to be there if their spouse dies. They invest in a banking account, and they expect those assets to be there. They buy a money market fund, and they expect that to be a safe investment. That is antithetical to investor protection risk because there sometimes the disclosure of the truth undermines the confidence that you need that those people rely on to keep their investments in banks--to keep their assets in banks and money market funds. So I would say those have to be separated, and investor protection needs to be, again, as I mentioned earlier, kept distinct from customer protection, which again is not something that needs to be regulated with an eye to promoting risk taking--that is, risk taking based on high expected value investments. And then, finally, I would say that I am a little concerned about mixing the systemic issue and the prudential issue. The way I have always thought about prudential oversight is that you are making sure that the promises made with respect to generally liabilities on one side are matched by the kind of assets that are created to support those liabilities. Systemic oversight is where you assume that prudential regulation, being necessarily imperfect, will sometimes lead to a breakdown, and the question is: What is the role of the Government going to be to prevent that breakdown under a prudential system, which will happen sometimes, and what will it do when it steps in? I think that that is a fundamentally separate function from prudential regulation, and that is why-- and I am not sure what a systemic regulator is as apart from a prudential regulator. But that is something, I think, that it would help to have more clarity on.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, Mr. Pickel.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Pickel","I think the requirement for greater coordination among the regulators is very important. I think that one of the things we are looking at here in the financial crisis is the ability to connect the dots across different products and across different markets, both nationally and globally. I think that is the root of some of the suggestions for the systemic risk regulator. But I think it could also be achieved, as I think Mr. Silvers and Mr. Turner suggested, through greater coordination or some collection of supervisor who would look at these issues and connect those dots.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Silvers.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","I find myself in the unusual position of having really nothing to disagree with in what I have heard so far at the table. I would say, though, that the single item that I would put to you, I would put differently than my co- panelists have done so far. I think that conceptually the thing you want to be most focused on is ensuring that we no longer have a Swiss cheese system, that we no longer have a system where you can do something like insure a bond, either in a completely regulated fashion, in which there are capital requirements and disclosure requirements and pre-clearance, or in a completely unregulated fashion through essentially a derivative and where you have none of these things; that the content of what a financial market actor does should determine the extent and type of that regulation. Closing regulatory loopholes, ending the notion that we have shadow markets, I think is the most important conceptual item for Congress to take up, because, otherwise, if it continues to be possible to essentially undertake the same types of activity with the same types of risk but to do so in an unregulated fashion, we will replay these events with a fair degree of certainty. And I believe that much of what the discussion about structure here has been is all about how we do that ending of shadow markets and regulatory gaps. I think in certain respects, some of the how is less important than actually getting it done. I would say, though, that I really strongly endorse what Mercer said about the different functions of regulation, that there is investor protection, disclosure and fiduciary duty oriented; there is consumer protection, although I think, Mercer, you had a different phrase for it, but protection around the public buying financial services which does not want to take risk; and then there is safety and soundness regulation. Those things are different, and it is dangerous to blend them.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Mr. Doe.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Doe","As I have listened to my fellow panelists, I am reminded of a book called ``Why Most Things Fail'' by a U.K. economist named Paul Oremerod, where he draws comparisons between species extinction models and those of corporate and market failures. And in it, he cites two conditions where we have failure of a species. And one is when it gets soft and is not challenged. The second is when there is not incremental learning that is constantly being done. And I think what I have gathered in the last 18 months-- and, again, in our small niche in the municipal bond industry, which is smaller than others that have been addressed here today. But it is that the idea of a regulator that has an inspired inquisitiveness and a sense of purpose so that they are eager to pursue an understanding of the markets that they regulate. If there has been one--and this is where I hope that if we have a consolidated or a sharing of information across the different asset classes or the different products, whether they be cash, whether they be swaps, whether they are equity, whether they are fixed income, that this provides an opportunity of being able to identify the first hints of failure that might occur in a system, and that way we might be faster to act. I think what is very interesting about, again, the industry that I have been involved with in the municipal bond sector is that when innovation of products finally makes its way into the public sector, it is almost the last place, again, because the revenue relatively is small compared to the other asset classes in the taxable markets. But I think it becomes magnified because you are starting to deal now with the public trust in the most intimate form. And I think so that when we start looking at regulation, it is, again, how do you inspire that trust, but how do you inspire that inquisitiveness of the regulator, and maybe it is the pride that is associated with doing the job that they feel that they are really able to accomplish something and make a difference. And I think that is what we are all trying to do here. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Last, Mr. Turner.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Turner","I actually think if I could just pick up a magic wand and do one single thing here, it would make sure that inside the agencies, the regulators, we had competent people who were in the right mind-set to go do their jobs. Bad loans, the Fed had the law that you all passed in 1994 giving them clear-cut authority to go eliminate those. They did not do it. Enforcement agencies have not done enforcement. The bottom line here is much of this could have been prevented without a single additional piece of legislation being done if people had just done their jobs back here. And I would urge you, go back, let us make sure we get the right people in, and then let us make sure, quite frankly, there is more active, proactive oversight by the appropriate committees of those responsible. Aside from that, I would turn around and say the No. 1 thing in the system has to be independence. These agencies have to clearly understand they are independent and free to go do what they need to do to protect investors and consumers. There should have been independence in the credit rating agencies. They clearly sold out. The e-mails and all show it. That was not there. There needs to be independence in the compliance officers in these businesses, in these banks. Clearly, that was not there. So aside from making sure you got people doing the job, we can have one peak, we can have two peaks. We can have 52--the 14,000 peaks that we have got in Colorado. But if you have got bad people sitting on the top of each of those peaks, it is not going to matter what you legislate here.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","With that encouraging note, let me turn to","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Turner, we are glad you are here. Thank you. Thank you very much. Professor Coffee, I would like to direct this to you, if I could. Thank you, and welcome to the Committee again. You spend a lot of time here, and we welcome you, and you have added a lot to us. You recommend giving the Federal Reserve Board authority to regulate capital adequacy, safety and soundness, and risk management of all financial institutions that are ``too big to fail.'' Is this suggestion based on a careful examination of the Federal Reserve's track record as a prudential supervisor up to this point, which I think is lacking? Did you take into consideration the fact that the Fed already has responsibility for monetary policy, bank supervision, and lender-of-last- resort functions? And are you concerned about the implications of the fact that, as you noted, the Fed is not politically accountable in the way other agencies are? I know that is a lot of question, but you are a distinguished professor and you can handle it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","Those are all good points.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Can you bring your microphone up a little bit? It is not on yet.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","The problem is that the Fed is not perfect. It is far from perfect. I think it is better positioned than agencies like the SEC. The SEC is focused on transparency and enforcement, not on prudential supervision, and the second-tier functions of an agency are the functions that are most likely to be captured by the industry. Also, frankly, there no longer are any investment banks. They have all moved someplace else. There is nothing left for the SEC to exercise prudential supervision over. Therefore, I have got to think we have to start, warts and all, with the Federal Reserve as the only body that has this capacity and has the orientation and has the competence. It may not always have performed well. Your point about political accountability is very important, and that is why I keep insisting that investor protection should not be subordinated and should be given to a very independent agency, the SEC or the SEC/CFTC, because I do not think you can count on the Fed with its orientation to ever be a champion of the investor's rights. The culture is one of secrecy, and you saw this all in the AIG. I think AIG is representative of the problems you will have if you depend upon the Fed for transparency. But I do not think the SEC is going to do much better than it did in the Consolidated Supervised Entity Program.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Professor Coffee, are you concerned that when you identify institutions as too big to fail, that will dull the market discipline of those firms which the market will view as having a Federal guaranty? Is that a concern always in the marketplace?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I am not testifying that every organization should be bailed out. I think the ones that most merit this are the ones that are so entangled that you get the true problem of systemic risk. Systemic risk is the danger of interconnected failures, the chain of falling dominoes. I am not telling you whether or not AIG should get more money. I am telling you only that where we have companies that are too entangled to fail, that is where we most need prudential supervision and a Systemic Risk Regulator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mark-to-market accounting, Mr. Turner wrote this up and I think he is right. Do you believe the current attacks on mark-to-market accounting, Mr. Turner, are motivated by a similar understandable desire to avoid taking painful write-downs?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Turner","I think, without a doubt, Senator Shelby, they are a problem here. You know, if you make a loan at $100 and you are only going to get $70 back, that is OK once or twice, but we did it millions and millions of times. The bottom line is they just aren't worth what they were, and to report to the public, to investors, regulators that you have got a balance sheet that is substantially different than what it is really worth is just flat out misleading, if not straightforward fraudulent.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Ryan, your testimony recommends a Financial Market Stability Regulator that, among other things, would have a direct role in supervising, quote, your words, ``systemically important financial organizations.'' What are the criteria, Mr. Ryan, that you would recommend for identifying systemically important entities, and do you believe that there would be any competitive implications for firms that are not so designated?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","Thank you for your question. We have given a lot of thought to a number of issues, and on some of these issues we do not have final decisions. I am talking now within the industry. For instance, we spent a lot of time talking about should we recommend the Fed immediately as the systemic regulator, and we have not come to that conclusion yet. If we had to do it right away, they are probably the best qualified to do it, but we think that the industry and the Congress, the American people, deserve a really comprehensive view. The same is true of who is systemically important. It is pretty easy to identify the early entrants because they meet the test that Professor Coffee has enunciated. They are too interconnected. They are very large. They are providing consolidated services to the citizens of this country and we need a better understanding of their interconnected aggregated risks. So the first group will be easy. The second group will be more difficult because they may not be so interconnected. They may not even be that large. But they may be engaged in practices which could have a very dramatic impact on our health. So our hope would be that we anoint a systemic regulator, maybe it is a new entity, maybe it is within Treasury, maybe it is the Fed, that we orient them in legislation toward preselection of the people who are very obvious, and that we give them the flexibility to include and actually to have people move out of systemically important status going forward. So once you are in it doesn't necessarily mean that you will stay in it. I think it is pretty clear, though, we all know the basic early entrants and they are our larger financial institutions. We, by the way, would not limit this by charter at all, so there will be banks, there will be insurance companies, there will be hedge funds, there could be private equity players. It is people who could have a dramatic effect on our lives.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Professor Coffee, why should we continue to prop up banks that are basically insolvent, some of our large banks that are walking dead, so to speak, give them a transfusion, and there is no end in sight? Why should we do that rather than take over some of their--guarantee some of their assets and whatever we have to do and wind them down?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","Again, it is a perfectly fair question and I am not telling you that every bank should be bailed out, not even every large bank. But if we are going to get the financial system working again, we have to move credit through banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","You can nationalize them. There still has to be a management.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I have never advocated that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","The government can't run a bank. It might be that if you want to name institutions that may not deserve further bail-outs, AIG is an example. It is not a bank and basically the government is spending $160 billion there to pay off the counterparties, most of whom are foreign banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Obviously poorly regulated.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I am saying that the key bank institutions are the only way we can get a corporate capital system moving again. The money has to flow through the system, and if they are part of the basic transmission belt, then there is a strong argument for ensuring their survival.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Ryan, you and your organization, the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, have advocated a merger of the SEC and the CFTC. You are not by yourself there. If a merger, should it go forward, should it occur simultaneously with whatever broader regulatory restructuring we undertake in this Committee? Should it be part of the overall comprehensive structure, restructure?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","I would sort your--because I think the biggest issue Congress has right now, you obviously have many, many issues on your plate and sorting them by priority is an essential component of your work right now, I am sure. So our recommendation is that you sort them with the systemic regulator being first and immediately come behind that with cleaning up the many regulatory agencies that have overlapping authority. If I was the new regulator, I may actually ask you to do those simultaneously so I would know my job. May I also----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","It would send certainty to the market, would it not?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","Yes, sir. I think that is possible. May I also just provide one comment based on your last question to the professor to my right?","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","Because I am probably--because I spent an awful lot of time in this Committee when I was the OTS regulator----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","You did.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","----dealing with the RTC, and what I learned through those 3 years brings me to a very firm view on opposition totally to nationalization of financial institutions. We have a process in this country through the FDIC where we, in a sense, nationalize. We call them bridge banks. We know that if you put very large institutions into bridge banks and they stay there for a very long period of time, the cost escalates enormously. You can look back to the RTC experiences. If we ask the government to take control of a large financial institution and run them, the cost of resolution is going to dramatically increase. The way we are doing it right now is much better. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","One last question, Mr. Chairman, if I can, to Mr. Silvers. Mr. Silvers, you advocate a greater role for long-term investors in the election, I will use your term, of psychologically independent directors on corporate boards. What measures would you take to ensure, sir, that these directors whose responsibilities would flow to all shareholders of the corporation are independent not only of management, which is important, but also the shareholder group responsible for their election?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Senator Shelby, I think that there are several specific ways of doing that. The first is that those mechanisms, as my testimony indicated, need to be tied to a certain amount of tenure as a shareholder. I think that is a way of ensuring that it is not captive to individuals who are looking for liquidity.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","What do you mean by tenure of a shareholder?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Holding, a holding period, that anyone who could use such a mechanism would have to be a fairly long-term holder so that you ensure that it is not used by people who are seeking a liquidity event as opposed to people who are seeking the long-term health of the corporation. Second, I think obviously that there needs to be, depending on exactly what mechanism one uses, that all discussions in this area have required that anyone who used such a mechanism would be either by themselves or as part of a group a significant set of holders. Certainly in large corporations, more than 1 percent of the shares, and in very large public corporations, it is a very large collection of money, or at least it used to be until recently market events. And then third, the most important protection here is a very simple one, which is that we are talking about a nomination mechanism, not an election mechanism. The majority of stockholders would have to vote for such a person, and the corporation, the management, at least under Delaware law, has the right to use pretty much limitless resources to campaign against them. I think that is the fundamental barrier. Senator Shelby, if you would allow me, I want to say a word or two to you about the Federal Reserve in response to your questions to Professor Coffee.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","I believe that the concerns you raise are profound and important ones and that they are profound in relation to the question of whether we want--the task we are asking a Systemic Risk Regulator to take on a fundamentally public task. The Oversight Panel that I serve on its regulatory reform recommendations specifically stated, if we are going to ask the Fed to take those obligations on, the Fed must be governed differently. I would be comfortable, personally, with that arrangement, with a greater degree of accountability and doing away with the self-regulatory aspects of some of what the Fed does. But I am convinced that that is probably not the best way to do this, and the reason why I am convinced about that is because, A, I am think that the Fed--there are tradeoffs with the Fed and the other things we ask the Fed to do. And the second reason is because, while I agree with Professor Coffee that the SEC is not suited to be the Systemic Risk Regulator, that that job is going to--as long as we have a twin peaks-type model where information about our markets is flowing from different directions within the regulatory system, that that coordination of information and openness to information is critical. If we ask one body to take it on, that is going to have an impact on the flows from the other bodies. The best answer, I think, in light of that is an agency with staff that is governed by the heads of our twin peaks or our three peaks. I hope we don't get to 14. How many hundred peaks are we talking about, Lynn?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","But an agency that is governed by the independent regulators but has its own staff and mission in this area. And I think the Fed would play a very large role there because they are----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","And they can't be overridden by the Fed?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Yes. That is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","That is important.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","I don't think we can give the power to override fully public bodies charged with issues like investor protection to the Fed. Thank you, Senator. I appreciate your indulgence.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much, and that is a question that many of us have raised, given the already full plate that the Fed has, in addition to roles they are taking on. The obvious problem is that if you move away from the Fed as the model, creating a whole new entity raises another whole set of issues and that is the quandary I find myself in. I don't disagree with Richard Shelby's point. We have all talked about it here at various other times. And then I quickly say to myself, so what is your alternative? And when I come to my alternative, I find myself almost in as much of a quandary. And so we find ourselves in this position of trying to make a choice between an existing structure in which I can see how this could fit--I think your point, as well--although you would have to make some changes in this thing, or trying to create something altogether new, which has also got its difficulties. But it is a very critical point, obviously, and one that we are talking about, obviously, at this point. Anyway, with that point, Senator Bennet, I thank you for your patience.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to start broadly and then ask a couple of narrow questions. Professor Coffee talked about the difference between the culture of the banking regulator and the culture of the securities regulator, which has been a theme that we have heard about in this Committee, and in thinking about the new structure, we want to make sure that that culture shifts, I think, so that we get the kind of oversight that all of us will feel comfortable with. In addition to that, there is the issue of no matter what structure you have, the constant innovation that goes on in the market and having some assurance that the regulator is keeping up with that innovation, as well. We want the innovation but we also want to make sure we understand it. And then Mr. Turner's observation that what is really critical, as it is with all human institutions, is that you get the right people in the job, and unfortunately, neither he nor we have the magic wand that he called for. But I guess the question I have is, are there thoughts from you, Professor Coffee or others on the panel, about what we could do in this legislation to assure that we have the kind of attention to the changes in the market knowledge about approach and the right people so that we can really get the job done?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","First of all, you and Senator Shelby are definitely focused on the proper issue. The Federal Reserve may have to change. You may have to give it a very different staff, a very different accountability structure. You are certainly going to want it to monitor, but I don't think you can ever make the Fed into a strong enforcement agency. I don't think you could ever make the SEC into a strong prudential supervisor. What I think you have to recognize is in terms of new market developments, the Fed has a more universal view. The SEC, at least as it stands today, doesn't have jurisdiction over swaps, over-the-counter derivatives, or futures. It is not going to know inherently what is going on in those areas. Yes, you could merge the SEC and the CFTC, but that compounds the political difficulties of achieving our solution by, I think, several orders of magnitude. And I would agree with the prioritization model that Mr. Ryan just discussed. First create the optimal kind of Systemic Risk Regulator, which may require changing the Fed, changing its accountability structure, giving it a permanent staff that would do the kind of monitoring we have in mind. But I think that is the smaller change than designing something totally from scratch.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stevens","Senator, could I comment on that? I know that many have not had a chance to absorb it, but I am very struck by what Chairman Bernanke had said today, because everyone is talking about his agency, of course, and he says, and I am quoting now, ``Any new systemic risk authority should rely on the information assessments and supervisor and regulatory programs of existing financial supervisors and regulators whenever possible.'' What that means to me is they don't want to take all these functions aboard themselves. They want a very strong Capital Markets Regulator. They want a very strong bank regulator. They probably want a very strong Federal insurance regulator that they can work with. The notion that they can pull all of that inside the Fed and at the same time accomplish their traditional missions is something I think, as I read the speech, and this is more subtext than text, is unsettling to the Chairman of the Fed, and with good reason, I believe. I would say also in commenting on Chairman Dodd's quandary, and I don't know if this is useful or not, but I spent a considerable period of time as Chief of Staff of the National Security Council and I have reflected a lot on that innovation in our government. It came online after World War II and our experience as a nation of the inability to coordinate and integrate the efforts of our Diplomatic Service, our Armed Forces, and the like at a time when we had burgeoning global responsibilities as the superpower in the aftermath of World War II. It is a Cabinet-level Council that is chaired by the President. It has a staff whose professionalism and abilities have been built up over time. And its function is there to collect information, to monitor developments, to integrate and coordinate the efforts of government. I think it is not out of the question that you could create a similar coordinating mechanism, and I think this is part of what Damon is pointing toward, at a very high level with the regulatory agencies that would pull all their expertise together, give the chairmanship of it to someone, and maybe that is the Chairman of the Fed, give it a permanent staff, and allow it to be monitoring and collecting data and doing the analysis, but in conjunction with those who are the front-line regulators and whose expertise has got to be leveraged. At least that is, I think, a reasonable concept on which to reflect.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","A completely unrelated question. I didn't come here to ask it, but the Ranking Member asked about mark- to-market and your answer is very clear. This is a place where I have gone back and forth. If our markets were lubricated and were doing what they were supposed to be doing, we wouldn't be sitting here talking about investing taxpayers' money the way we are talking about investing it to create stability in the market. And I wonder whether there are others here that have a different point of view on mark-to-market in this sense. It seems to me that there is a legitimate distinction between assets that are held by these banks that have no collateral behind them or very little collateral and assets that are held by our banks that have collateral but simply have no market right now and therefore aren't trading at all. I know there is a pure view that says that should tell you that the assets don't have value, but the thing I keep stumbling over is that some have collateral and some don't have collateral and shouldn't we be taking notice of that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","I do not, in general, share Lynn's complete enthusiasm for mark-to-market accounting. I think that there are a wide range of areas in financial accounting where historical cost accounting is actually more indicative of the life of the business than mark-to-market. However, the financial institutions, particularly those with demand deposits where in theory the funds can walk out the door, are ones that seem uniquely kind of attuned to mark-to-market principles. In the course of the work of the Congressional Oversight Panel, we have done two oversight--two hearings, two field hearings in relation to our mortgage crisis, which I believe and I think most economists believe is at the heart of what has gone wrong here in our economy, that underlies the financial crisis, and it is clear from those field hearings, in P.G. County not ten miles from here and in Nevada, that even at this late date, we do not seem to be able to get rational outcomes out of private ordering in terms of non-performing mortgages. We can't get the mortgage providers and the servicers to negotiate rational outcomes with homeowners. Now, I believe that this is related to the remnants of non- mark-to-market accounting in banking, that effectively loans that are never going to be worth--the banks are carrying loans that are never going to be worth full value, even though they are capped at high values maybe not at par, but at close to par. And the one thing that would force them to mark them down would be a rational settlement with the homeowner, because then you would have to admit what you actually had. Now, you asked about collateral. You walk through the subdivisions and not all of them are new. In P.G. County, you have got a lot of people who have been effectively exploited and stripped of their homes. That is Prince George's County, for those who are not Washingtonians, here in Maryland. You look at those properties. There may be collateral, but it will never support par value, never. It may return--it may recover value. It may, 10 years from now, if the last very serious real estate collapse is indicative, and I am afraid this is clearly worse, in many areas, it took 10 years to recover from the bust of the late 1980s and early 1990s. But returning to par in 10 years means you are never really worth par present value basis, you are not going to be there. And so I am in favor of sort of--I am kind of in the middle of the road on these issues, but I think we need to recognize that there could be very, very serious broad economic consequences of indulging the fantasy that subprime loans backed up by collapsed residential property are ever going to be worth par. They are just not. And the consequences of that pretense is actually throwing people out of their homes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Mr. Chairman, could I ask one more quick question----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Certainly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","----for Mr. Doe. I was very interested in your testimony. This is a line of conversation that Senator Warner and I have been having. I assume that your view is that there is Federal authority now to be able to intercede, either through the Treasury or the Fed, with the VRDO market in some way that may give hospitals, public hospitals, schools, and other municipal credit some relief from the lack of market that exists for variable rate debt----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Doe","Well, I think one of the key issues associated with that is that many of the issuers that have--that are confronted now with challenges of restructuring their debt in the variable rate market, as I pointed out in my testimony, these variable securities have links to interest rate swaps which have created all sorts of issues. And one of the things that these--the cost of termination of the swap transaction has become overly penal, and in some of these small towns and counties where it is arguably there was a mismatch in terms of appropriateness. And again, remember that the regulatory body of the municipal industry doesn't have purview--has limited purview, only on dealers and only on cash securities. So here you have these cash transactions linked to swaps. It makes it a little bit of a conundrum. But one of the things we think where the Treasury could step in and make a big impact is to provide subsidized loans to municipal issuers that would help them terminate those swap transactions, and then over time, the cost of those loans could be recouped in future transactions and discriminate fee, and I think that would be a really important step. So I think those are the people and the institutions that have been most adversely impacted.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","I would like to thank the witnesses for their testimony. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, gentlemen, for excellent testimony. Just as two preliminary points, first, I want to thank Professor Coffee for his kind words about our credit rating legislation. Thank you very much and thanks for your help. And then to Mr. Turner's point about the need for resources regardless of what we do, this omnibus we are debating contains an additional $38 million for the Securities and Exchange Commission and the proposed budget of the President is around a 13 percent increase over the 2008 marks going forward, so I completely concur. We can make all the structural and legislative changes in the world, but if they don't have the resources and the will to do the job, it won't get done. One of the impressions I had listening to your comments is that I think we were in this sort of false logic where regulators of all ilk were looking at the capital of institutions, saying we don't have to be too sensitive to their risk evaluation assessments because they have got capital. Of course, the capital was risk-based, so you are in this circle around where if you don't do a good job evaluating capital based on risk, then you don't have the capital, et cetera. Part of this goes to Basel, the efficacy or the effectiveness of Basel. I think that has to be looked at. And the other issue I think has to be looked at, too, is just the managerial capacity to run these organizations. I think one of the issues of size is do you really have the wherewithal, the computer systems, the structural managerial skills to run them? This is a long sort of preface to be saying that it appears that this, in my view, twin peaks model we will probably adopt in some form, that by default, perhaps the Federal Reserve will become the regulator, and unless we make some significant changes in the culture and the operating standards of the Federal Reserve, we might be exactly where we were before, that this sort of just looking at risks--not looking at risks, not looking really well at management. So I don't know if you have comments, Professor Coffee and gentlemen?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I think that is the danger. I think you are correct and I think it does justify what I think Senator Shelby was going for, some modification of the charter and the requirements and responsibilities of the Federal Reserve. I think the best way to protect transparency is to make sure that the SEC's authority to require full disclosure is not circumscribed. But I do think that we are now in the world where the price of all bank stocks has fallen so low, with Citicorp trading at $1.50, this is the time to pursue mark-to- market because the market doesn't believe these banks have any value. You might as well bring the accounting in accord with the reality as the market reflects it. I think your concern is that changes in the Federal Reserve is a sound concern, and I can't tell you, because I am not a Federal Reserve expert, of what the five things I would do first to the Federal Reserve are.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Does anyone else want to comment? Mr. Ryan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","We have been talking about resources, and many of the panelists have talked about whatever changes we make here, let us make sure that we have the right people doing the job, that they have adequate resources. One specific topic I think deserves the Committee's attention and Congress's attention is whoever is going to do this job has to have the technology resources to get the job done, because when we ask someone to be the systemic regulator for our most important financial institutions, we are also, I think, asking them to do a job that regulators have not really done well at all, which is to look over the horizon. They are pretty good at looking back and looking at what went wrong and let us see if we can fix it. But we are going to ask this new entity or the Fed to do a job that we have not really done before and they need to have the tools to do it. They really need to think about the technology demands, because right now, we do not have a full understanding of the aggregated or collective risks of all of these interconnected entities. We have the capacity to do it from a technology, hardware, software standpoint, but we don't really have that done. It is going to be very expensive and it is very important that you spend some time on that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","One of the points I would note is that when Chairman Donaldson became Chairman of the SEC, he tried to establish a risk assessment operation. That initiative was undone by his successor. But I think we should consider along those lines, Mr. Ryan, requiring the systemic regulator to have a rather independent risk assessment group that on a periodic basis will publish to the Congress and to the people what they consider to be the most significant pending risk and the likelihood. That might force discussion and maybe even sometimes action. Professor Bullard, and then Mr. Silvers and then Mr. Turner, and then I have one last point.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bullard","I just wanted to add that, again, to me, the systemic risk question is one of someone who has oversight over a range of prudential regulatory regimes. The Fed already is our systemic regulator. It may not have that aggregated information as Paul was talking about, but it has the discount window, it has the open market transactions, it has the ability essentially to create money, although the Treasury has shown remarkable ingenuity in creating money recently, as well. So it already serves in that role. I think it is a separate question as to as it sits back and decides where it needs to take action to affect credit markets, it sees some hot spots over here with respect to the support for some area, that it also should not necessarily be expected to be the prudential regulator that is in charge of monitoring what stands behind that particular area of our financial services, because those really are separate functions. The systemic regulator is one who can go in and fix it with ultimately taxpayer dollars and then tries to find situations where it can mitigate that risk and reduce it. The prudential regulator is the one who writes the rules that says, to back these kinds of liabilities, these are the kinds of assets we expect you to have, and I am not sure that those are necessarily ones that should be or have to be housed in the same agency.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Silvers, then Mr. Turner, then I have one final unrelated question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Senator Reed, first, I share your concerns about Basel II. I think that is clearly part of the causal fabric here for our crisis. There are three points about the sort of managerial and task challenges associated with systemic risk regulation. First, the Congressional Oversight Panel in its regulatory reform report suggested that the notion of intelligence, of looking over the horizon in relation to financial market systemic risk, should perhaps be delegated not to a regulatory body but to a panel of outside experts--some of my fellow panelists here might make good members of such a panel--whose sole job was to look ahead and that were not intertwined in the politics of the regulatory landscape. Second--and this is a concern that Senator Shelby raised-- our view was it would be a very bad idea to name who is systemically significant. In fact, it is not only a bad idea in terms of moral hazard, but it is actually impossible to do; that in a crisis people will--institutions will turn out to be systemically significant that you had no idea were. And Exhibit 1 for that is Bear Stearns. And there are other times, calm times, when very large institutions may be allowed to fail, and probably should be; and that rather than naming institutions, we ought to have the capacity--and this comes to your point--the capacity for the systemic risk regulator to work with other regulators to set ratchets around capital requirements and around insurance costs to discourage people getting essentially too big to fail and to set up the financial basis to rescue them if they do. Finally, there is, I think, some--I am not a Fed expert, but I think there is some confusion about where the money comes from for bailouts and rescues and so forth. The Fed does not have the authority, as far as I know--although you all maybe can educate me. The Fed does not have the authority to simply expend taxpayer dollars. The Fed lends money. It is the lender of last resort. In a true systemic crisis, as we have just learned, we get beyond the ability of liquidity to solve the problem, and in that circumstance we start expending taxpayer dollars. It is hard not to look at the TARP experience and what preceded it and not conclude that the ad hoc quality of those experiences did not build public confidence or political support for what had to be done. Given all of that, I think we need to understand that when we ask a body to take on the role of systemic risk regulator, that also means we are asking them to take on the role of rescuer, and potentially to expend taxpayer dollars. And that I think requires a set of governance mechanisms and capacities, to your question, Senator, that we have yet really to build. And it also requires, I think, a careful balance between genuine public accountability and transparency, on the one hand, and genuine independence from the all too eager desire of everyone around to bail out their friends.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Turner, do you have comments?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Turner","Just like Damon, I would say Basel II needs to be re-examined. I expressed concern almost 8 years ago to the Fed that it would not work, and I think if it stays the way it is, it will contribute to further problems. I think Sheila Bair has been very insightful on that in that regard. As far as managing the risk, I have actually had to run a large international semiconductor company, and in the technology area, we had a lot of risk, and it changed very dramatically, much faster than what it even does in the banking industry. And what we found was, if we are going to be successful in managing the risk, we could not do it with the same people that we had necessarily running the operational, the manufacturing side of the company. You needed a group of people that were much more focused on the future and where things were going. They needed to be looking not just ahead, but much further ahead, and have a pulse not only what was going on but where that turned around and took you. After Donaldson formed the Risk Management Office, I went and visited with him for a while. Certainly that type of mentality plus the tools were not in that group at that point in time. I have not seen that at the Fed in my dealings with the Fed over the last couple decades either. I am not sure you can get that without a major wholesale change, and so I come back to--having gone through this and having to manage risk myself, I come back to probably what Damon has said, and probably the best way to put this together across the broad spectrum would be to create the separate organization, chaired with the board of the major chairmen of the major agencies, but with real staff and real resources and focused on that aspect of the business. I just do not think we are going to get it if you put it inside one of these agencies. And, in fact, think about it. We have had risk management-- a Risk Management Office in the Fed, in the OCC, in the SEC, and it has not worked. And why would we turn around, given what this devastation and travesty has cost us all, why would we go back and say let us try it again? You know, this is not one where I give people another swing at the bat.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Chairman, you have been very kind. I have one question, if I may.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I will address it to Professor Coffee, because it might be way off the beaten track. In fact, it sounds like an extra credit question in a law exam.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","So here it goes. Whatever happened to Rule 10b-5? I mean, I have been listening to discussions of potential fraud in the marketplace, securities that had no underlying underwriting. And I grew up thinking that material omissions as well as material commissions gives the SEC in every capacity, as long as it is a security, to go in vigorously to investigate, a private right of action, and yet I have been before the Committee now for 2 and 3 years, and I do not think anyone has brought up, you know, Rule 10b-5 actions. Can you just sort of----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","I am glad you asked that question because it is a good question, but there are two major limitations on Rule 10b-5. As you have heard from others on this panel, it does not apply to aiders and abetters, even those who are conscious co- conspirators in a fraud. That is one limitation that Congress can address. And, two, when you try to apply Rule 10b-5 to the gatekeepers, whether it is the accountants or the credit rating agencies, you run up against the need to prove scienter. It is possible to have been stupid and dumb rather than stupid and fraudulent, and that is basically the defense of accountants and credit rating agencies. I think you need to look to a standard of scienter that will at least create some threat of liability when you write an incredibly dumb AAA credit report on securities that you have not even investigated, because you do not do investigations as a credit rating agency. You just assume with the facts that you are given by management. So I do think there is some need for updating the anti- fraud rules for the reasons I just specified.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Warner.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. A fascinating panel. First of all, I commend you for asking that ``What is the one take-away?'' question from each of these gentlemen. And while I think there was a consensus that we need to get rid of this shadow market, we need to make sure we get rid of this Swiss cheese approach to regulation, I think we will be challenged, taking some of these broad overviews and taking them into specific legislation.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","And I appreciate your asking that question. I want to follow up, before I get to my quick question, on Senator Shelby's comments along the notion of the institutions that have posed this systemic risk, the ``too big to fail'' excuse, and Damon's comments about perhaps not publishing those that are systemic risks, but this problem we are in the middle of the crisis now of too big to fail. And I would be curious perhaps in a written question to the Members--I know Senator Shelby has, I think, provocatively raised a number of times the issue of, well, how much more on Citi and should we go ahead and let it go through some kind of process? And the quick response normally being, well, no, that is too big to fail. Well, I would love to hear from the panel, perhaps in written testimony, if you were to see the transition, dramatic transition--and I know we are sometimes afraid of the terminology, whether it is ``receivership'' or ``nationalization,'' some other way to get it out of the current ditch that it is in--you know, how you would take one of these institutions that fall into this ``too big to fail'' category that appears to have real solvency issues and get it through a transition? And I perhaps would work with the Senator on submitting that type of written question. So we have seen, you know, the big take-aways on how we regulate and where we put this prudential or systemic risk oversight. We have seen the question of how we deal with the current challenging institution. I want to come with my question, and I know our time is about up, but I will start with Mr. Pickel, but would love to hear others' comments on this, and that is, maybe come at this from the other end. Even if we get the risk right, with the great people that Mr. Turner has advocated, where and how should we look at the products? I would argue that intellectually I understand the value of derivatives and the better pricing of risk. I candidly would love somebody to say, How much societal value have we gained from this additional pricing of this risk when we have seen all of the downside that the whole system is now absorbing because, to use your terms, you know, actions by AIG and others of misunderstanding of the products and not taking appropriate hedging? I guess I have got a series of questions. How do we prevent the current products or future products from being abused? Should we have standards whereby if an AIG, a future AIG, either misunderstood or went beyond protocols, that that would set off more than an alarm bell and would require some kind of warning? Is it simply enough to say we are going to move toward some level of a clearinghouse? Is clearing alone enough security? As some of the European regulators have talked about for those products and contracts that do not go through a clearinghouse, should there be needs of additional capital requirements? You know, I am all for innovation, but in some cases I think under the guise of financial innovation and financial engineering, we have ended up with a lot of customers, including customers that Mr. Doe represents in terms of some of the muni market, getting in way over their head. And I just fear on a going-forward basis that regulation and transparency alone may not solve the problem. So rather than coming at it at the macro level on regulation or on the specific issues that I think Senator Shelby has wonderfully raised about how do we unwind one of the ``too big to fail'' institutions, I would like to look at it from the bottom up on the products line, starting with Mr. Pickel and then anybody else can comment.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Pickel","Yes, I think as far as the products themselves, if you look, for instance, at the credit default swap market, there is information that has been published by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation through their trade information warehouse, which encompasses 80 to 90 percent of credit default swaps engaged in around the world. And the information there is that virtually all the trades in that warehouse, essentially all, 100 percent, are done involving at least one dealer party who is, in fact, a regulated institution, and actually 86 percent of them are between two dealer institutions. So you have got that structure of the institutional regulation there, of the oversight of those individual firms looking at the activities of those firms. And I think the Committee, again, heard testimony from the OTS last week admitting some shortcomings in their enforcement and in their execution of their authority, but perhaps we should look at making sure that they have got the ability to understand and get more detail on the products that those individual entities are----","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Just a quick question, Mr. Pickel. But those 86 percent of institutions that are involved in using these products, are you saying the market knows all the terms and conditions and that we have got a transparent market there?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Pickel","The parties who engage in those transactions have access to information and have the transparency to engage in those transactions. I think you also have regulators who have the authority--whether they have exercised it and what they have done with that, we should discuss further. But they have the authority to understand what those institutions are doing. I think the other thing is--and we have got a very good example of this in the credit default swap market, an effort that goes back to September 2005, started by now---- Treasury Secretary Geithner, to pull in the regulators in a global initiative, regulators from around the world, as well at that time 18 major credit default swap players, dealers, and also buy-side entities as well, to talk about issues that were serious and needed to be addressed in the credit default swap market at that time. And significant progress was made very quickly, with the implicit threat--or, actually, explicit threat, I think, from the regulators, that if you do not get your act in order on these backlogs and assignment issues, that they will actually stop people from trading. So the regulators indicated that they would take that action, and the industry responded. The experience that we have gone through in settling credit default swaps over the past 6 to 8 months has been significantly facilitated by the foresight of Secretary Geithner at that time to anticipate these problems. So that was an important step at that time. So I think looking at those kind of public-private interactions where regulators and the industry work together to identify these issues is very important going forward as well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Stevens, I would love to hear from you, Mr. Ryan, and Mr. Silvers.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stevens","Thank you, Senator. I think it is a really excellent question, and I have asked myself this, and it is not intended as a competitive observation. If Franklin Roosevelt were to come back today and he would find we had these enormous pooled funds that were outside, virtually outside of any form of regulation, I think he would say, ``I thought we solved that problem in 1940.'' We need to make sure that the evident developments--and these are not secrets--the evident developments, major developments in our capital markets are addressed as they arise. Hedge fund investing is no doubt a tremendous innovation that can be of great value. But there were trillions of dollars in hedge funds that had no form of regulation. I think that is something that Congress was aware of, certainly the SEC was aware of. You could say the same about the major pooled funds in the money markets that will be part of the subject of our report when it is issued. Money market mutual funds are about a $4 trillion intermediary, but we're only about a third of the money market, which has many other pooled funds. So I think it is a problem--and this is how I envision it-- of making sure that the capital markets regulator is staying even with market developments, and that is going to require not only nimbleness at a regulatory level, but, frankly, Mr. Chairman, it requires--it puts a burden on Committees like yours, because in many instances it is going to require the tough work of closing regulatory gaps, providing new authority, and even providing new resources. I do not think, however, that the answer, Senator is creating a new agency that only looks at products, because those products arise and exist in the context of a larger marketplace, and they need to be understood in that context.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Ryan.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ryan","Bob Pickel and I have basically overlapping membership. He is very domain oriented, very specific to derivatives, and we are basically almost all of the other products and oversight. We have spent a lot of time, I would say, over the last 6 months trying to figure out what should we be recommending for a new regulatory structure. And I would say it is a uniform view among the core members of our group and of his group that we feel comfortable recommending a systemic risk regulator that would have no real limits on their authority. So they would have all markets, they would have all market participants who are significant. It would not make any difference of their charter, so it could be a bank, it could be an insurance company, it could be a hedge fund. And included therein would be their authority to deal with, for instance, derivative products. So we can see that there is a lack of confidence in the system. There is a lack of confidence among Members of this Committee, Members of Congress, members of other statutory developing entities around the globe, and we need to address that. So our first attempt at this is to say let us do it through the systemic regulator. Through the systemic regulator, we will also expand the activity, expand the breadth and depth of what is done from a regulatory standpoint to cover areas that have been discussing during this panel, some of the stuff that Paul has raised. That is the best way to do it. We are also going to, in a very early phase, be able to address most of the key issues and do it in a thoughtful manner.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Silvers and Mr. Doe.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Senator, these are very acute observations you have made about this set of questions. First, I am pleased to see that a moment of disagreement has emerged. My colleagues on the panel who wish to put the burden of regulating unregulated markets, like hedge funds and derivatives, on the systemic risk regulator are, in my opinion, making a grave mistake. What we need is routine regulation in those areas. That is what closing the Swiss cheese system is about, is routine regulation, not emergency regulation, not, you know, looking at will they kick off a systemic crisis. Just an observation about that. I think that the Fed's refusal to regulate mortgages was rooted somehow in the sense that consumer protection was a kind of--something that was not really a serious subject for serious people. It turned out to be, of course, the thread that unraveled the system. I think that we should learn something from that. When we talk about routine regulation in these areas, I think to your question, we have got to understand that it is more than one thing. For example, a credit default swap contract is effectively a kind of insurance. And if someone is writing that insurance, they should probably have some capital behind the promise they are making. That is what we learned not just in the New Deal but long before it about insurance itself, which was once an exotic innovation. But we learned we had to have capital behind it. But that is not the extent of what we need to do. If, for example, there are transparency issues, there are disclosure issues associated with these kinds of contracts, for contracts in which public securities are the underlying asset, it is clear that we need to have those kinds of disclosures, because if we do not, then we have essentially taken away the transparency from our securities markets. Now--two final points. One, derivatives and hedge funds have something profound in common. They do not have any substantive content as terms. They are legal vehicles for undertaking anything imaginable. You can write a derivative contract against anything. You can write it against the weather, against credit risk, against currency risk, against securities, against equity, against debt. It is just a legal vehicle for doing things in an unregulated fashion. A hedge fund is the same thing. The hedge fund is not an investment strategy. It is just a legal vehicle, and it is a legal vehicle for managing money any way you can imagine, in a way that essentially evades the limits that have historically been placed on bank trusts and mutual funds and so on and so forth. What is smart regulation here is not specific to those terms. It is specific to those activities. It is specific to money management. It is specific to insurance. It is specific to securities. And that is why it is so important that when we talk about filling these regulatory gaps, we do so in a manner that is routine, not extraordinary. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Doe","Senator Warner, if I could just offer an example, I like Mr. Silvers' comment about the subject of regulation being routine, because I think that brings vigilance. Let me give you just a quick example of why when I hear you ask the question about products, why I think that is so important. After the Lehman bankruptcy in September, on the Wednesday following there was a liquidation, an unannounced liquidation by a money market fund of substantial holdings of cash- equivalent securities which had been created in the municipal market through leverage programs and which were used-- essentially synthetics securities, so derivatives. The liquidation, unannounced--again, a trying time in the market in mid-September--resulted in the following day of there being no liquidity in the municipal secondary market, where one transaction that occurred in a distressed situation resulted in the repricing of the entire holdings of investors that were in mutual funds that were in individual holdings. We estimated that, in a back-of-the-envelope kind of way, about $5.5 billion were lost on that September 18th, solely because an illiquid market, because of liquidation of a cash security that was synthetic in order to fulfill the needs of having short-term investments for these money market funds, is that created a crisis in confidence that--and a confusion among investors as to what was the security of the credits of the States, of the towns that were, you know, issuing municipal debt. And that type of concern--and that lasted through September and October, and municipal issuers who were trying to come to market and raise important funds for capital projects and for operations were really inhibited by extraordinarily penal rates. So here we had this, you know, single event and this cascaded, touching upon cash securities, derivative securities, and then also tied to the supposedly the most secure cash equivalents in these money market funds. The other thing I think is really important and not to be lost here, as we are talking about cash securities, we are talking about derivatives, and a lot has been talked about credit default swaps, the municipal market, predominantly it is interest rate swaps. Here, again, there is not transparency. And yet these are linked intimately with cash transactions. And when we talk about, gee, the taxpayer is coming in and helping to bail out the various transgressions that have occurred in the banking system or in the financial system is that here we have taxpayers--and I think, Senator Shelby, you had some instances with some derivatives in your State that are getting a lot of headlines. And taxpayers are on the hook most directly right there. And I would argue and suggest to you the notion of really examining this opportunity that we have in our U.S. municipal bond market, where all these products have come to roost, and the credit default swap market is emerging. It is in its nascent stage in the municipal bond market. Yet it is there, and it is creating perhaps a thinness or an illiquid market that those derivative products is maybe creating misconceptions about the soundness of our States and our towns and our counties. And so I think that when we start looking at how do we gain transparency on these securities that are now part of the risk management of our municipalities and how do we help so we can understand them, so we can see them, so investors that are putting their--are facilitating the borrowing by buying these securities, they can see what is going on, and we can also help to protect these issuers who, as Mr. Turner was saying--well, as we were talking about broadly in this financial regulation of the separation of risk management and operation, is that here we have these--our States and our towns and counties that are serving--wearing both hats and using complex securities that they may not have fully understood. So I guess when I hear you talk about products, I applaud that, because I think that it just cannot be the people involved. We have to look at what is being used, but also being--the word has been used--``nimble'' so that we can adapt regulation and be flexible so that as new innovations come in that can be very positive but also can be seen and understood.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","And I think our time has expired, and my only last comment would just be that I think we will get to some stance where we will have some level of regulatory oversight. My hope is that we will adhere to Mr. Turner's suggestion that it is a nimble and well-funded regulator. But I would say from the industry, we are going to need your help on setting standards not just retrospectively but prospectively. With the complexity and financial engineering that goes on, I just do not want to be here 5 years later looking at what the next round of new products would be and say, ``Why didn't we see that ahead of time?'' and helping us see what those standards--so that you do not end up with having to pre-clear every new product at some regulator. You know, you are going to have to really step up on this one and give us some assistance. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you as well, Senator Warner. Very good questions. Before I turn to Senator Shelby for any closing comments or questions he has, I am struck by a couple of things. It is exactly the point that Senator Warner was concluding with. There is this debate about whether or not we have a principle- based system or a rule-based system in the country. And I have always felt I was sort of in a small, tiny minority that is attracted to the principle-based system for the simple reason that it seems to me almost in a way a bit more intimidating than a rule-based system for the very reason that Senator Warner suggested, that you end up setting standards or rules, and within a matter of literally hours, in some cases, very creative, imaginative people can come up and figure out some way just to get around that rule, legally and ethically and every other reason. And so you are back at it again because someone has come up--now, I think the idea of a clearinghouse makes a lot of sense, by the way, new product lines, and I know Senator Shelby feels as strongly as I do about that. But that in itself sort of is an indication of a problem you have with a rule-based system, and I wonder if just quickly any of you have any quick comments on a rule-based versus a principle-based system that you would care to share at this point. Professor Coffee.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coffee","Well, I have written a long article on this that is currently posted on SSRN. I do not think any workable system can exist without being a combination of both. You need the principles to backstop the rules, but you can really only enforce rules, and particularly in our litigation-oriented system, we want rules that let you know you are within the safe harbor and you have done what you are supposed to do. So I think there has to be a combination of both with principles backstopping the rules.","Speech"," "

"Mr. Turner","Senator Dodd, I would agree with Jack on this one. First of all, you know, if you look at the Ten Commandments, half the people tell you they are principles, half them tell you they are rules.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Turner","So I am not sure anyone knows really what a principle or rule is. I think it does take a combination. Principles get so broad that you just never get enforcement. Rules get so detailed that people just skirt around them. So it takes some common sense and a combination.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Silvers, do you have a comment you want to make?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","Only that one of the reasons why this discussion has become sort of hard to follow or hard to understand is because the concept of a principles-based system became code, became a code word for a weak regulatory system.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Silvers","And, in reality, a true principles-based system would be the strongest possible regulatory system, but it would be one no one could live in for the reasons that my two colleagues on the panel have outlined.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Pickel","I would agree in general that we prefer a principles-based approach. There may be certain circumstances such as with retail investors where having clearer rules for those who engage in those markets would be appropriate. But for the markets that I think people are engaged in derivatives, in OTC derivatives, I think the principles approach is the best one.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bullard","I would just add, putting on a private practice hat for a moment, that principles-based regulation is intimidating, as you described, because what it means is that regulators have enormous enforcement discretion, and what you typically have, at least at the SEC, it means that they play ``gotcha'' and bring cases that are based on specific rules that are made up under those principles as opposed to opposed to having known ahead of time exactly how the SEC might interpret certain positions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Shelby.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I will be brief. Mr. Chairman, thank you for assembling this panel. We could be here all day and probably learn a heck of a lot. Principles matter, but rules matter, too. I like the idea of what Professor Coffee is saying. We might need a hybrid in some way. If you just have principles and no rules, you know, gosh, who is going to define them to a certain extent? But just rules, people say, ``Well, we have got a rule. How can we get around it? How can we evade it in some way?'' So maybe it is a combination. Who knows? But thank you for your input, and, you know, we have an awesome task ahead of us here. We have got to do this right. We cannot rush to it. We have both met with the President on this and many meetings. It has got to be comprehensive. It cannot cover every contingency. But I think we can do better than we have been doing. I wish my friend Senator Warner was still here, because we agree on a lot of things, but some of the product approvals, some of these products have got to be approved before they do irreparable damage to, I think, the marketplace myself. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Shelby, and again, you have been a terrific panel and offered some wonderful advice. We will probably submit some additional questions for you over the coming days, and we look forward to your continuing involvement with us. We have a formal setting here, but my intention is to also have some informal settings with interested members here and other members who are not on the Committee, necessarily, who would like to be a part of the discussion as we move forward on this, because there is a growing interest, obviously, not just on the part of this Committee but others who care about this issue and are interested in how we proceed. So I am very, very grateful to all of you for your knowledge, your background, your experience, and the thoughtfulness with which you have prepared your testimony today and contributing to this very, very difficult task. Let me just say as well how much I appreciate Senator Shelby and the other Members of the Committee. Always from time to time we have our differences, but Senator Shelby has made the point and I make it as well: This is one where the barriers that we traditionally see along political lines have to really evaporate and disappear. I personally have said I am agnostic on the question of--I do not bring any ideological framework whatsoever to this. I want to do something that works, that closes gaps, that does not have that Swiss cheese look to it where people can forum shop, in a sense, in order to avoid the regulatory process, to make sure we have good people who are being adequately compensated for the jobs that they are doing, and then doing what has to be done, is engaging on a consistent basis. These things are never done forever. There are always new products, new ideas, new--which is the genius of this in many ways. That is not a liability. That is an asset, in a sense. I have often said our goal here is to, one, make sure that we have a solid, sound system that reflects the times we are in, but not so rigid that it in any way strangles the kind of creativity and imagination that has drawn the world and others to come here to make their investments, because we are creative and imaginative. But at the same time, we do not want to be at such creativity and imagination that we lose the kind of protections. Striking that balance is never perfect. It is never perfect. It is always tilting one way or the other. And our job is to constantly try and keep that balance, if we can, as we go forward. And that is the challenge we have in front of us, and so we welcome your involvement and thank you immensely for your participation. The Committee will stand adjourned.","Speech"," "
"Secretary, U","S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated October 2, 2007, available at http://www.ici.org/statements/cmltr/ 07_sec_proxy_access_com.html#TopOfPage At the same time, the privilege of proxy access should not be granted lightly. The Federal securities laws should not facilitate efforts to use a company's proxy machinery--at company expense--to advance parochial or short-term interests not shared by the company's other shareholders. Instead, the regulatory scheme should be crafted to afford access to a company's proxy only when the interests of shareholder proponents are demonstrably aligned with those of long-term shareholders. To achieve this objective, appropriate limits on the ability to use company resources to propose changes to a company's governing documents are critically important. In our view, these limits should include: LRestricting the privilege of proxy access to shareholders who do not acquire or hold the securities for the purpose of changing or influencing control of the company. Shareholders seeking to change or influence control of the company should be required to follow the regulatory framework for proxy contests and bear the related costs. LRequiring shareholder proponents to demonstrate that they are long-term stakeholders with a significant ownership interest. We recommend that there be a meaningful required holding period, such as two years, to provide assurance that shareholder proponents are committed to the long-term mission of the company, rather than seeking the opportunity for personal gain and quick profits or advancement of parochial interests at the expense of the company and other shareholders. Similarly, we support establishing a relative high minimum ownership threshold that would encourage shareholders to come together to effect change. We believe a five percent ownership threshold may not be sufficiently high to assure that the company's proxy machinery would be used to advance the common interests of many shareholders in addressing legitimate concerns about the management and operation of the company. Consideration should be given to varying the required ownership threshold based on factors such as the company's market capitalization. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) should study share ownership and holding period information to arrive at well- reasoned criteria that will encourage would-be shareholder proponents to work together to achieve goals that benefit all shareholders. LExcluding borrowed shares from the determination of ownership level and holding period. Beneficial ownership of shares should be required to assure that the proponents' interests truly are aligned with those of long-term shareholders. Another important element of proxy access is disclosure. Shareholder proponents should be required to provide disclosure for inclusion in proxy materials that would allow a company's other shareholders to make informed voting decisions (e.g., information about their background, intentions, and course of dealing with the company). SEC rules also should hold shareholder proponents--and not companies--responsible for the disclosure those shareholders provide. SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro recently indicated that the SEC will soon consider a proposal ``to ensure that a company's owners have a meaningful opportunity to nominate directors.'' \16\ We look forward to reviewing and commenting on the SEC's proposal. \16\ See SEC Speech: Address to the Council of Institutional Investors, by Chairman Mary L. Schapiro, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (May 6, 2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/ 2009/spch040609mls.htm Say on Pay: As noted above, funds are significant holders of public companies. When deciding whether to invest in a company or to continue to hold its stock, funds consider many factors, including how the company compensates its top executives. This information is important because it allows funds to decide whether (1) there is an alignment of interests between the executives running the company and the shareholders who own the company and (2) executives have incentives to maximize value for shareholders. ICI has supported SEC efforts to ensure that investors receive clear and complete disclosure regarding executive pay packages. The financial crisis has fanned the flames of public outrage over executive compensation, particularly where such compensation appears to be grossly excessive in light of a company's performance or where the compensation seems to promote the short-term interests of managers over the longer- term interests of shareholders. Funds are deeply mindful of these issues. ICI would not oppose requiring public companies to put the compensation packages of their key executive officers to a non-binding advisory vote of shareholders as an additional way to encourage sound decision-making by companies regarding the composition of executive pay packages. We strongly urge, however, that any such requirement be coupled with requiring other institutional investors to disclose their proxy votes, as we recommend above. Otherwise, the votes of funds on executive compensation, but not those of any other institutional investor, would be subject to scrutiny and, often we feel, unfair second-guessing. Moreover, the potential benefits of greater transparency of the proxy voting process would seem to be particularly evident here, where the public disclosure of executive compensation votes would maximize their influence over management. Q.5. Credit Rating Agencies: A. Please identify any legislative or regulatory changes you believe are warranted to improve the oversight of credit rating agencies. In addition, I would like to ask your views on two specific proposals: 1. LThe Peterson Institute report on ``Reforming Financial Regulation, Supervision, and Oversight'' recommended reducing conflicts of interest in the major rating agencies by not permitting them to perform consulting activities for the firms they rate. 2. LThe G30 Report ``Financial Reform; A Framework for Financial Stability'' recommended that regulators should permit users of ratings to hold NRSROs accountable for the quality of their work product. Similarly, Professor Coffee recommended creating potential legal liability for recklessness when ``reasonable efforts'' have not been made to verify ``essential facts relied upon by its ratings methodology.'' A.5. Measures To Improve the Oversight of Rating Agencies: ICI is committed to the objective of improving the rating process to make ratings more accurate and useful to investors and to promote the sound functioning of our capital markets. \17\ We recommend several regulatory measures to enhance the oversight of credit rating agencies and thereby improve the quality, accuracy, and integrity of ratings and the rating process. \18\ Generally speaking, our recommendations would enhance disclosure, address conflicts of interest, and hold rating agencies accountable for their ratings. \19\ \17\ ICI recently participated in the SEC's Roundtable on the oversight of credit rating agencies in an effort to further the discussion on ways in which to improve ratings and the ratings process. See Statement of Paul Schott Stevens, President and CEO, Investment Company Institute, SEC Roundtable on Oversight of Credit Rating Agencies, dated April 15, 2009, available at http://www.ici.org/home/ 09_oversight_stevens_stmt.html#TopOfPage. See also Statements of Paul Schott Stevens, President, Investment Company Institute, on the ``Credit Rating Agency Duopoly Relief Act of 2005,'' before the Committee on Financial Services, U.S. House of Representatives (November 29, 2005) and on ``Assessing the Current Oversight and Operation of Credit Rating Agencies,'' before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate (March 7, 2006). \18\ See Letter from Karrie McMillan, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Florence Harmon, Acting Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated July 25, 2008; Letter from Karrie McMillan, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated March 26, 2009. \19\ We believe the SEC currently has authority to implement many of our recommendations. Others (such as certain changes to improve municipal securities disclosure, discussed below) would require Congressional action. Specifically, we recommend that the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) improve disclosure about credit ratings and the rating process for structured finance securities and other debt securities. Public disclosure of information about a credit rating agency's policies, procedures, and other practices relating to rating decisions will allow investors to evaluate more effectively a rating agency's independence, objectivity, capability, and operations. Disclosure will serve as a powerful additional mechanism for ensuring the integrity and quality of the credit ratings themselves. To realize the full potential of such a disclosure regime, the SEC should require the standardized presentation of this information in a presale report issued by the rating agencies. The SEC also should take steps to strengthen the incentives to produce quality ratings, because such incentives are clearly insufficient in the current system. To this end, the SEC should require rating agencies to conduct ``due diligence'' assessments of the information they review to issue ratings. This should help build investor confidence in ratings and the rating process over time, by enabling users of ratings to gauge both the accuracy of the information being analyzed by the rating agency and the rating agency's ability to assess the creditworthiness of the underlying security. We also recommend that rating agencies have greater legal accountability to investors for their ratings. Both of these recommendations should encourage rating agencies to improve the quality of their ratings. Today's rating system is hampered by deep concerns about conflicts of interest, poor disclosure, and lack of accountability. To address these concerns effectively, the SEC should apply necessary regulatory reforms in a consistent manner to all types of credit rating agencies. A consistent approach is not only critical to improving ratings quality and allowing investors to identify and assess potential conflicts of interest, but also to increasing competition among rating agencies. The SEC must also employ a consistent and active approach to enforcement of the oversight regime, holding rating agencies accountable for any failures to comply with the SEC's rules and the rating agency's own policies and procedures adopted under the rules. Finally, we recommend that the SEC address the need for better disclosure by certain issuers (e.g., expand issuer disclosure for structured finance products, expand and standardize issuer disclosure for asset- backed securities, and require that disclosure for asset-backed securities be ongoing). In addition, we recommend that the SEC improve issuer disclosure for municipal securities. \20\ Better disclosure will assist investors in making their own risk assessments and should foster better quality ratings. \20\ See Letter from Karrie McMillan, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Florence Harmon, Acting Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated September 22, 2008. Controlling Conflicts of Interest--Limiting or Prohibiting Consulting Activities: Addressing conflicts of interest at rating agencies is particularly important given the role that ratings play in today's capital markets. For this reason, ICI has recommended that the SEC require rating agencies to disclose information, including: (1) any material ancillary business relationships between a rating agency and an issuer and (2) information regarding the separation of a rating agency's consulting and rating activities. \21\ If such information is available, we believe that it is unnecessary to prohibit rating agencies from performing any consulting activities for the firms they rate. The SEC already has prohibited rating agencies from rating a product in which the rating agency has been consulted on the structure of the product. We believe that this measure, in combination with the disclosure we have recommended, should curtail opportunities for questionable conduct. In addition, it should put investors on notice regarding potential conflicts of interest arising from a rating agency's consulting business and provide investors with the information needed to assess the ability and effectiveness of a rating agency to manage those conflicts of interest. \21\ See Letter from Karrie McMillan, General Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Florence Harmon, Acting Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated July 25, 2008. Enhancing Accountability, Due Diligence, and Legal Liability of Rating Agencies: Given the role of ratings in the investment process and the use of ratings by investors, ICI agrees with the recommendation in the G30 Report and by Professor Coffee: credit rating agencies should have greater legal accountability for their ratings. Currently, investors do not have sufficient legal recourse against rating agencies if, for example, a rating agency issues an erroneous rating. We believe that the exemption for nationally recognized statistical rating organizations (NRSROs) from Section 11 of the Securities Act of 1933 should be reconsidered. \22\ Under current regulations, the SEC exempts NRSROs, but not other rating agencies, from treatment as experts subject to liability under Section 11 and, thus, allows NRSRO ratings in prospectuses and financial reports. Although the SEC has stated that NRSROs remain subject to antifraud rules, the NRSROs have steadfastly maintained that, under the First Amendment, they cannot be held liable for erroneous ratings absent a finding of malice. \22\ Section 11 under the Securities Act creates liability for issuers and certain professionals who prepared or certified any part of a registration statement for any materially false statements or omissions in the registration statement. While it may be argued that rating agencies should not be liable for an erroneous rating as such, they should, at a minimum, have some accountability for ratings issued in contravention of their own disclosed procedures and standards. As we have stated in the past, even if the First Amendment applies to credit ratings, it should not immunize rating agencies for false or misleading disclosures to the SEC and to the investing public. Quite simply, if a rating agency obtains an NRSRO designation based on, for example, a specific ratings process, it should be held accountable to the SEC and to investors if it fails to follow that process. A rating agency's ability to continue to claim First Amendment rights also has been questioned based on the business decisions and the roles undertaken by rating agencies over the last decade. Rating agencies have abandoned their former practice of rating most or all securities whether or not hired to do so, and rating agencies have become deeply involved in the structuring of complex securities, which are normally not sold to retail investors. These changes warrant serious attention when considering whether rating agencies still merit the protection that the First Amendment may have provided to them in their more traditional role. \23\ \23\ Rating agencies have cited the First Amendment in statements to Congress, the courts, and the investing public, stating that their ratings are opinions only--not ``recommendations or commentary on the suitability of a particular investment.'' See, e.g., Statement of Deven Sharma, President, Standard & Poor's, on ``Credit Rating Agencies and the Financial Crisis,'' before the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, U.S. House of Representatives (October 22, 2008). See also Not ``The World's Shortest Editorial'': Why the First Amendment Does Not Shield Rating Agencies From Liability for Over- Rating CDOs, David J. Grais and Kostas D. Katsiris, Grais & Ellsworth, Bloomberg Law Reports (November 2007). In addition to increasing legal accountability for rating agencies, we believe that rating agencies would have greater ability to produce high quality and more reliable ratings if they were required to conduct better due diligence and verification. Under current SEC rules, it is difficult for a user of a rating to gauge the accuracy of the information being analyzed by the rating agency and, thus, evaluate the rating agency's ability to assess the creditworthiness of a structured finance product. \24\ Rating agencies are required neither to verify the information underlying a structured finance product received from an issuer nor to compel issuers to perform due diligence or to obtain reports concerning the level of due diligence performed by issuers of structured finance products. \24\ Current rules only require that rating agencies provide a description of: (1) the public and nonpublic sources of information used in determining credit ratings, including information and analysis provided by third-party vendors; (2) whether and how information about verification performed on assets underlying structured finance securities is relied upon in determining credit ratings; and (3) whether and how assessments of the quality of originators of structured finance securities factor into the determination of credit ratings. To address these concerns, we recommend that credit rating agencies be required to conduct due diligence on the information they review to issue ratings. In addition, to raise investor confidence in the quality of ratings and the rating process as a whole, the due diligence requirements should apply (as appropriate) to all rated debt securities, not only structured finance products. Specifically, we recommend that: LRating agencies be required to have policies and procedures in place reasonably sufficient to assess the credibility of the information they receive from issuers and underwriters. LRating agencies disclose these policies and procedures, the specific steps taken to verify information about the assets underlying a security, and the results of the verification process. LRating agencies disclose the limitations of the available information or data, any actions they take to compensate for any missing information or data, and any risks involved with the assumptions and methodologies they use in providing a rating. LRating agencies be required to certify that the rating agency has satisfied its stated policies and procedures for performing due diligence on the security being rated. Q.6. Hedge Funds: On March 5, 2009, the Managed Funds Association testified before the House Subcommittee on Capital Markets and said: ``MFA and its members acknowledge that at a minimum the hedge fund industry as a whole is of systemic relevance and, therefore, should be considered within the systemic risk regulatory framework.'' MFA supported the creation or designation of a ``single central systemic risk regulator'' that (1) has ``the authority to request and receive, on a confidential basis, from those entities that it determines . . . to be of systemic relevance, any information that the regulator determines is necessary or advisable to enable it to adequately assess potential risks to the financial system,'' (2) has a mandate of protection of the financial system, but not investor protection or market integrity and (3) has the authority to ensure that a failing market participant does not pose a risk to the entire financial system. Do you agree with MFA's position? Do you feel there should be regulation of hedge funds along these lines or otherwise? A.6. Systemic Risk Regulation: Over the past year, various policymakers and other commentators have called for the establishment of a formal mechanism for identifying, monitoring, and managing risks to the financial system as a whole. ICI concurs with those commentators and with the Managed Funds Association (MFA) that creation of such a mechanism is necessary. The ongoing financial crisis has highlighted the vulnerability of our financial system to risks that have the potential to spread rapidly throughout the system and cause significant damage. A mechanism that will allow Federal regulators to look across the system should equip them to better anticipate and address such risks. Generally speaking, MFA's statement about a ``single central systemic risk regulator'' touches on some of the same themes that ICI addressed in its March 3, 2009, white paper, Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations. \25\ In our white paper, we endorsed the designation of a new or existing agency or inter-agency body as a ``Systemic Risk Regulator.'' Broadly stated, the goal in establishing a Systemic Risk Regulator should be to provide greater overall stability to the financial system as a whole. The Systemic Risk Regulator should have responsibility for: (1) monitoring the financial markets broadly; (2) analyzing changing conditions in domestic and overseas markets; (3) evaluating the risks of practices as they evolve and identifying those that are of such nature and extent that they implicate the health of the financial system at large; and (4) acting to mitigate such risks in coordination with other responsible regulators. \25\ See Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations, which is available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/ ppr_09_reg_reform.pdf. We note that the white paper was included as an attachment to ICI's written testimony. In ICI's view, Congress should determine the composition and authority of the Systemic Risk Regulator with two important cautions in mind. First, the legislation establishing the Systemic Risk Regulator should be crafted to avoid imposing undue constraints or inapposite forms of regulation on normally functioning elements of the financial system, or stifling innovations, competition or efficiencies. By way of example, it has been suggested that a Systemic Risk Regulator could be given the authority to identify financial institutions that are ``systemically significant'' and to oversee those institutions directly. Such an approach could have very serious anticompetitive effects if the identified institutions were viewed as ``too big to fail'' and thus judged by the marketplace as safer bets than their smaller, ``less significant'' competitors. \26\ \26\ See, e.g., Peter J. Wallison, Regulation Without Reason: The Group of Thirty Report, AEI Financial Services Outlook (Jan. 2009), available at http://www.aei.org/publications/pubID.29285/pub_detail.asp Second, the Systemic Risk Regulator should not be structured to simply add another layer of bureaucracy or to displace the primary regulator(s) responsible for capital markets, banking or insurance. We strongly concur with MFA that the Systemic Risk Regulator should focus principally on protecting the financial system--as discussed in detail in our white paper, we believe that a strong and independent Capital Markets Regulator (or, until such agency is established by Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission) should focus principally on the equally important mandates of protecting investors and maintaining market integrity. Legislation establishing the Systemic Risk Regulator should define the nature of the relationship between this new regulator and the primary regulator(s) for each industry sector. This should involve carefully defining the extent of the authority granted to the Systemic Risk Regulator, as well as identifying circumstances under which the Systemic Risk Regulator and primary regulator(s) should coordinate their efforts and work together. We believe, for example, that the primary regulators have a critical role to play by acting as the first line of defense with regard to detecting potential risks within their spheres of expertise. In view of the two cautions outlined above, ICI believes that the Systemic Risk Regulator would be best structured as a statutory council comprised of senior Federal regulators. Membership should include, at a minimum, the Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the heads of the Federal bank and capital markets regulators (and insurance regulator, if one emerges at the Federal level). Regulation of the Hedge Fund Industry--Appropriate Focus of Regulatory Oversight: In 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted a rule to require hedge fund advisers to register with the SEC as investment advisers. ICI supported this registration requirement as a way to provide the SEC with reliable, current, and meaningful information about this significant segment of the capital markets without adversely impacting the legitimate operations of hedge fund advisers. Many ICI member firms--all of whom are registered with the SEC--currently operate hedge funds and have found that registration is not overly burdensome and does not interfere with their investment activities. In June 2006, the SEC's hedge fund adviser registration rule was struck down by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit. The following month, in testimony before this Committee, then SEC Chairman Christopher Cox commented that the rule's invalidation had forced the SEC ``back to the drawing board to devise a workable means of acquiring even basic census data that would be necessary to monitor hedge fund activity in a way that could mitigate systemic risk.'' \27\ \27\ See Written Testimony of SEC Chairman Before the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs (July 25, 2006) (concerning the regulation of hedge funds), available at http:// www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2006/ts072506cc.htm In our white paper, we call for this regulatory gap to be closed. Specifically, ICI recommends that the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC) have express regulatory authority to provide oversight over hedge funds (through their advisers) with respect to, at a minimum, their potential impact on the capital markets. \28\ For example, similar to MFA's recommendation, we state that the regulator could require nonpublic reporting of information such as investment positions and strategies that could bear on systemic risk and adversely impact other market participants. \28\ It is imperative, of course, that the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC) be organized and staffed, and have sufficient resources, to effectively perform this oversight function. We continue to believe that hedge fund adviser registration is an appropriate response to address the risks that hedge funds can pose to the capital markets and other market participants. In this regard, the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC) may wish to consider the adoption of specific rules under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 that are tailored to the specific business practices of, and market risks posed by, hedge funds. Areas of focus for such rulemaking should include, for example, disclosure regarding valuation practices and the calculation of investment performance; both of these areas have been criticized as lacking transparency and presenting the potential for abuse. ICI does not support, however, requiring the registration of individual hedge funds with the SEC. Rather, as discussed in detail below, ICI believes there must continue to be a strict dividing line between registered, highly regulated investment companies and unregistered, lightly regulated hedge funds. A registration requirement for hedge funds would blur this line, invariably causing confusion for both investors and the marketplace. This confusion would likely exacerbate already imprecise uses of the term ``fund'' to refer to investment pools, whether registered or not. Further, we believe it is imperative to keep any problems in the hedge fund area from bleeding over in the public's mind to include mutual funds, which are owned by almost half of all U.S. households. Maintaining the distinctions between investment companies and hedge funds--Compared to registered investment companies, which are subject to the comprehensive and rigorous regulatory regime set forth in the Investment Company Act of 1940 and related rules, hedge funds are lightly regulated investment products. Hedge funds are effectively outside the purview of the Investment Company Act by reason of Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7), which require that the hedge fund is not making or proposing to make a public offer of its securities and that those securities be sold only to certain specific groups of investors. These provisions thus place express statutory limits on both the offer and the sale of securities issued by a hedge fund. ICI firmly believes that these limits must be preserved and should be reconfirmed in any legislation enacted to regulate hedge funds or their advisers. No general solicitation or public advertising by hedge funds--Despite clear statutory language precluding a hedge fund from ``making or proposing to make a public offer of its securities,'' there have been several occasions in the recent past where the hedge fund industry has argued that it should be able to advertise through the public media, while remaining free from the regulatory restrictions and shareholder protections imposed by the Investment Company Act. Additionally, in 2003, the SEC staff recommended that the SEC consider eliminating the prohibition on general solicitation in offerings by certain hedge funds. ICI emphatically opposes any such efforts, because allowing hedge funds organized pursuant to Sections 3(c)(1) and 3(c)(7) to engage in any form of general solicitation or public advertising is fundamentally inconsistent with hedge funds' exclusion from regulation under the Investment Company Act. Section 3(c)(7) was added to the Investment Company Act in 1996, in apparent recognition that the full panoply of investment company regulation is not necessary for hedge funds (and other private investment pools) offered and sold only to financially sophisticated investors able to bear the risk of loss associated with their investment. The ``no public offering'' language used by Congress in Section 3(c)(7) generally tracks the language in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933. For almost five decades, the SEC has taken the position that public advertising is inconsistent with a nonpublic offering of securities under Section 4(2). \29\ \29\ See Non-Public Offering Exemption, SEC Rel. No. 33-4552 (Nov. 6, 1962) at text preceding n.2, text preceding n.3 (``Consideration must be given not only to the identity of the actual purchasers but also to the offerees. Negotiations or conversations with or general solicitations of an unrestricted and unrelated group of prospective purchasers for the purpose of ascertaining who would be willing to accept an offer of securities is inconsistent with a claim that the transaction does not involve a public offering even though ultimately there may only be a few knowledgeable purchasers . . . . Public advertising of the offerings would, of course, be incompatible with a claim of a private offering.''). In its rulemaking to implement Section 3(c)(7) and related provisions, the SEC observed that ``while the legislative history . . . does not explicitly discuss Section 3(c)(7)'s limitation on public offerings by Section 3(c)(7) funds, the limitation appears to reflect Congress's concerns that unsophisticated individuals not be inadvertently drawn into funds.'' \30\ A member of Congress intimately involved in this debate later concurred with the SEC's interpretation in a letter to then SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt. His letter further explained: \30\ See Privately Offered Investment Companies, SEC Rel. No. IC- 22597 (April 3, 1997), at n.5. In 1996, as part of the National Securities Markets Improvement Act, Congress reaffirmed that hedge funds should not be publicly marketed, specifically adding this restriction to a modernized hedge fund exemption that was included in the final bill. As you will recall, I was one of the authors of this provision . . . I believe that the Congress has appropriately drawn the lines regarding hedge fund marketing, and intend to strongly oppose any effort to liberalize them. \31\ \31\ See Letter from Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) to SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt, dated Dec. 18, 2000. Any form of general solicitation or public advertising of unregistered hedge funds would surely cause investors to confuse such funds with registered, highly regulated investment companies. It also would present greater opportunities for perpetrators of securities fraud to identify and target unsophisticated investors. This potential for investor confusion and fraudulent activity would be compounded by the fact that the SEC simply would not have the resources to monitor advertisements by hedge funds--whether legitimate or fraudulent--in any meaningful way. For all of these reasons, ICI firmly believes that there must continue to be a strict prohibition on any form of general solicitation or public advertising in connection with hedge fund offerings. Limitations on who may invest in hedge funds--No less critical is the need to ensure that interests in hedge funds are sold only to financially sophisticated investors able to bear the economic risk of their investment. To this end, ICI believes that the accredited investor standards in Regulation D under the Securities Act of 1933 (which determine investor eligibility to participate in unregistered securities offerings by hedge funds and other issuers) should be immediately adjusted to correct for the substantial erosion in those standards since their adoption in 1982. This one-time adjustment should be coupled with periodic future adjustments to keep pace with inflation. Specifically, ICI has recommended that the SEC's Office of Economic Analysis be required to reset the accredited investor thresholds every 5 years, so that the percentage of the population qualifying as accredited investors would remain stable over time. This would entail a straightforward economic analysis that could be performed using widely available government databases. \32\ \32\ For a detailed discussion of the Institute's views on these issues, see Letter from Paul Schott Stevens, President and CEO, Investment Company Institute, to Nancy M. Morris, Secretary, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated Oct. 9, 2007, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-07/s71807-37.pdf Also in this regard, ICI continues to support the SEC's 2006 proposal to raise the eligibility threshold for individuals wishing to invest in hedge funds (and other private investment pools) organized under Section 3(c)(1) of the Investment Company Act. Specifically, an individual would need to be an ``accredited investor'' based upon specified net worth or income levels, as is now required, and own at least $2.5 million in investments. According to the SEC, this new two-step approach would mirror the existing eligibility requirements that Congress determined were appropriate for investors in hedge funds organized under Section 3(c)(7). Q.7. Self-Regulatory Organizations: How do you feel the self- regulatory securities organizations have performed during the current financial crisis? Are there changes that should be made to the self-regulatory organizations to improve their performance? Do you feel there is still validity in maintaining the self-regulatory structure or that some powers should be moved to the SEC or elsewhere? A.7. Self-regulatory organizations (SROs) form an integral part of the current system of securities markets oversight. ICI has had a longstanding interest in the effective and efficient operation of SROs, and we support an examination of their role and operations. We believe there may be several ways to improve SROs' performance and operations, particularly through enhancements to their rules and rulemaking processes, and their governance structure. SRO rules should be crafted both to protect investors and to promote efficiency, competition and capital formation. To achieve these objectives, it is critically important that SROs consider the relative costs and benefits of their rules. We have recommended on several occasions that Congress by law, or the SEC by rule, require that all SROs evaluate the costs and benefits of their rule proposals prior to submission to the SEC and establish a process for reexamining certain existing rules. \33\ This process should be designed to determine whether the rules are working as intended, whether there are satisfactory alternatives of a less burdensome nature, and whether changes should be made. \33\ See Statement of the Investment Company Institute on the Review of the U.S. Financial Markets and Global Markets Competitiveness, Submitted to the Senate Republican Capital Markets Task Force, U.S. Senate (February 25, 2008) and Submission of the Investment Company Institute to the Department of the Treasury, Review of the Regulatory Structure Associated with Financial Institutions (December 7, 2007). The SRO rulemaking process itself serves important policy goals, including, among other things, assuring that interested persons have an opportunity to provide input regarding SRO actions that could have a significant effect on the market and market participants. ICI has supported amendments that would improve the ability of interested persons to submit comments on SRO actions. In particular, we have recommended extending the length of the comment period for any significant SRO proposal. \34\ See Letters from Craig S.

"Secretary, U","S. Securities and Exchange Commission, dated June 4, 2004. Finally, ICI supports efforts to strengthen SRO governance processes. \35\ For example, to ensure that the views of investors are adequately represented, we have recommended that SROs be required to have sufficient representation from funds and other institutional investors in their governance structures. In addition, to address concerns that SROs are inherently subject to conflicts of interest, consideration should be given to requiring SRO boards to have an appropriate balance between public members and members with industry expertise. \36\ \35\ See, e.g., Letter from Ari Burstein, Associate Counsel, Investment Company Institute, to Jonathan G.

Walter Before the Mutual Fund Directors Forum Ninth Annual Policy Conference (May 5, 2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/speech/ 2009/spch050509ebw.htm Q.8. Structure of the SEC: Please share your views as to whether you feel that the current responsibilities and structure of the SEC should be changed. Please comment on the following specific proposals: 1. LGiving some of the SEC's duties to a systemic risk regulator or to a financial services consumer protection agency; 2. LCombining the SEC into a larger ``prudential'' financial services regulator; 3. LAdding another Federal regulators' or self-regulatory organizations' powers or duties to the SEC. A.8. Investment companies (funds) are both major holders of securities issued by public companies and issuers of securities (fund shares) held by almost half of all U.S. households. As such, they have a vested interest in the effective regulation of the capital markets by a strong and independent regulator. Funds and their shareholders stand to benefit if that regulator has the tools it needs to fulfill important policy objectives, such as: preserving the integrity of the capital markets; ensuring the adequacy and accuracy of periodic disclosures by public issuers; and promoting fund regulation that protects investors, encourages innovation, and does not hinder market competition. As discussed in its March 3, 2009, white paper, Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations, \37\ ICI supports the creation of a new Capital Markets Regulator that would encompass the combined functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and those of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) that are not agriculture-related. In our response below to part A of the question, we briefly discuss this recommendation and our suggestions relating to the Capital Markets Regulator's responsibilities and structure. Pending, or in the absence of, Congressional action to create a Capital Markets Regulator, most of our recommendations just as appropriately could be applied to the SEC. Where appropriate for ease of discussion, we use the term ``agency'' to refer equally to the SEC or a new Capital Markets Regulator. \37\ See Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations, which is available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/ ppr_09_reg_reform.pdf. We note that the white paper was included as an attachment to ICI's written testimony. We then address the issues outlined in part B of the question in the context of a discussion about how the SEC or a new Capital Markets Regulator should fit within the broader financial services regulatory framework. Reforming the Responsibilities and Structure of the SEC: To bring a consistent policy focus to U.S. capital markets, ICI strongly recommends the creation of a new Capital Markets Regulator. Currently, securities and futures are subject to separate regulatory regimes under different Federal regulators. This system reflects historical circumstances that have changed significantly. As recently as the mid-1970s, for example, agricultural products accounted for most of the total U.S. futures exchange trading volume. By the late 1980s, a shift from the predominance of agricultural products to financial instruments and currencies was readily apparent in the volume of trading on U.S. futures exchanges. In addition, as new, innovative financial instruments were developed, the lines between securities and futures often became blurred. The existing, divided regulatory approach has resulted in jurisdictional disputes between the SEC and the CFTC, regulatory inefficiency, and gaps in investor protection and market oversight. With the increasing convergence of securities and futures products, markets, and market participants, the current system simply makes no sense. As envisioned by ICI, the Capital Markets Regulator would be a single, independent Federal regulator responsible for oversight of U.S. capital markets, market participants, and all financial investment products. It would have an express statutory mission and the rulemaking and enforcement powers necessary to carry out that mission. \38\ From the perspective of the fund industry, the mission of the Capital Markets Regulator must involve maintaining a sharp focus on investor protection, supported by a comprehensive enforcement program. This core feature of the SEC's mission has consistently distinguished the SEC from the banking regulators, who are principally concerned with the safety and soundness of the financial institutions they regulate, and it has generally served investors well over the years. \38\ Currently, regulatory oversight of both the securities and futures industries involves various self-regulatory organizations. In establishing a Capital Markets Regulator, Congress would need to determine the appropriate role for any such organization(s). Examination of the recent financial crisis has prompted calls for Congress to close regulatory gaps to ensure appropriate oversight of all market participants and investment products. In our white paper, we recommend that the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC) have express regulatory authority to provide oversight with regard to hedge funds, derivatives, and municipal securities. We further recommend that the agency be given explicit authority to harmonize the legal standards applicable to investment advisers and broker-dealers. How a regulatory agency is managed, and the details of its organizational structure, can have significant implications for the agency's effectiveness. In our white paper, we offer the following suggestions with regard to management and organization of the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC). LEnsure high-level focus on agency management. One approach would be to designate a Chief Operating Officer for this purpose. LImplement a comprehensive process for setting regulatory priorities and assessing progress. It may be helpful to draw upon the experience of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority, which seeks to follow a methodical approach that includes developing a detailed annual business plan establishing agency priorities and then reporting annually the agency's progress in meeting prescribed benchmarks. LPromote open and effective lines of communication among the Commissioners and between the Commissioners and staff. Such communication is critical to fostering awareness of issues and problems as they arise, thus increasing the likelihood that the agency will be able to act promptly and effectively. A range of approaches may be appropriate to consider in meeting this goal, including whether sufficient flexibility is provided under the Government in the Sunshine Act, and whether the number of Commissioners should be greater than the current number at the SEC (five). LAlign the inspections and examinations functions and the policymaking divisions. This approach would have the benefit of keeping staff in the policymaking divisions updated on current market and industry developments, as well as precluding any de facto rulemaking by the agency's inspections staff. LDevelop mechanisms to facilitate coordination and information sharing among the policymaking divisions. These mechanisms would help to ensure that the agency speaks with one voice. How the SEC (or a New Capital Markets Regulator) Fits Within the Broader Financial Services Regulatory Framework: Today's financial crisis has demonstrated that the current system for oversight of U.S. financial institutions is insufficient to address modern financial markets. In its white paper, ICI recommends changes to create a regulatory framework that enhances regulatory efficiency, limits duplication, closes regulatory gaps, and emphasizes the national character of the financial services industry. In brief, ICI supports: LCreating a consolidated Capital Markets Regulator, as discussed above; LEstablishing a ``Systemic Risk Regulator'' that would identify, monitor and manage risks to the financial system as a whole; LConsidering consolidation of the regulatory structure for the banking sector; LAuthorizing an optional Federal charter for insurance companies; and LPromoting effective coordination and information sharing among the various financial regulators, including in particular the new Systemic Risk Regulator. Increased consolidation of financial services regulators, combined with the establishment of a Systemic Risk Regulator and more robust inter-agency coordination and information sharing, should facilitate monitoring and mitigation of risks across the financial system. We believe that consolidation of regulatory agencies also may further the competitive posture of the U.S. financial markets and could make it easier, when appropriate, to harmonize U.S. regulations with regulations in other jurisdictions. Reducing the number of U.S. regulatory agencies, while also strengthening the culture of cooperation and dialogue among senior officials of the agencies, will likely facilitate coordinated interaction with regulators around the world. By providing for one or more dedicated regulators to oversee each major financial services sector, this proposed structure would maintain the specialized focus and expertise that is a hallmark of effective regulation. This structure also would allow appropriate tailoring of regulation to accommodate fundamental differences in regulated entities, products and activities. Additionally, it would avoid the potential for one industry sector to take precedence over the others in terms of regulatory priorities or approaches or the allocation of regulatory resources. In particular, the regulatory structure favored by ICI would preserve the important distinctions between the mission of the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC), which is sharply focused on investor protection, and that of the banking regulators, which is principally concerned with the safety and soundness of the banking system. Both regulatory approaches have a critical role to play in ensuring a successful and vibrant financial system, but neither should be allowed to trump the other. For this reason, we believe it would be inappropriate to combine the SEC into a larger ``prudential'' financial services regulator, a move that could result in diminished investor protections. Preserving regulatory balance, and bringing to bear different perspectives, is a theme that has influenced ICI's thinking on how to structure a Systemic Risk Regulator. In our white paper, we suggested that very careful consideration must be given to the specifics of how a Systemic Risk Regulator would be authorized to perform its functions. We offered two important cautions in that regard. First, we recommended that the legislation establishing the Systemic Risk Regulator should be crafted to avoid imposing undue constraints or inapposite forms of regulation on normally functioning elements of the financial system, or stifling innovations, competition or efficiencies. Second, we recommended that the Systemic Risk Regulator should not be structured to simply add another layer of bureaucracy or to displace the primary regulator(s) responsible for capital markets, banking, or insurance. Legislation establishing the Systemic Risk Regulator thus should define the nature of the relationship between this new regulator and the primary regulator(s) for each industry sector. This should involve carefully defining the extent of the authority granted to the Systemic Risk Regulator, as well as identifying circumstances under which the Systemic Risk Regulator and primary regulator(s) should coordinate their efforts and work together. We believe, for example, that the primary regulators have a critical role to play by acting as the first line of defense with regard to detecting potential risks within their spheres of expertise. In view of the two cautions outlined above, ICI believes that the Systemic Risk Regulator would be best structured as a statutory council comprised of senior Federal regulators. Membership should include, at a minimum, the Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, and the heads of the Federal bank and capital markets regulators (and insurance regulator, if one emerges at the Federal level). Finally, we note that the question requests comment on whether some of the SEC's duties should be given to a financial services consumer protection agency. As a general matter, we observe that Federal regulators must improve their ability to keep up with new market developments. This will require both nimbleness at the regulatory level and Congressional willingness to close regulatory gaps, provide new authority where appropriate, and even provide additional resources. ICI does not believe, however, that it would be helpful to create a new ``financial products safety commission'' or ``financial services consumer protection agency.'' Financial products and services arise and exist in the context of a larger marketplace, and they need to be understood in that context. The primary regulator is best positioned to perform this function. Q.9. SEC Staffing, Funding, and Management: The SEC has a staff of about 3,500 full-time employees and a budget of $900 million. It has regulatory responsibilities with respect to approximately: 12,000 public companies whose securities are registered with it; 11,300 investment advisers; 950 mutual fund complexes; 5,500 broker-dealers (including 173,000 branch offices and 665,000 registered representatives); 600 transfer agents, 11 exchanges; 5 clearing agencies; 10 nationally recognized statistical rating organizations; SROs such as the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. To perform its mission effectively, do you feel that the SEC is appropriately staffed? funded? managed? How would you suggest that the Congress could improve the effectiveness of the SEC? A.9. Investment companies (funds) are both major holders of securities issued by public companies and issuers of securities (fund shares) that are held by almost half of all U.S. households. As such, they have a vested interest in effective regulation of the capital markets by a strong and independent regulator. Funds, and therefore their shareholders, stand to benefit if that regulator has the tools it needs to fulfill important policy objectives, such as: preserving the integrity of the capital markets; ensuring the adequacy and accuracy of periodic disclosures by public issuers; and promoting fund regulation that protects our investors, encourages innovation, and does not hinder market competition. As discussed in our March 3, 2009, white paper, Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations, \39\ ICI supports the creation of a new Capital Markets Regulator that would encompass the combined functions of the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC). The white paper makes a series of recommendations--including several concerning the staffing, funding, and management of the Capital Markets Regulator--aimed at maximizing this regulator's ability to perform its mission effectively. Pending, or in the absence of, Congressional action to create a Capital Markets Regulator, most of our recommendations just as appropriately could be applied to the SEC. An outline of those recommendations is included in the response below. Where appropriate for ease of discussion, we use the term ``agency'' to refer equally to the SEC or a new Capital Markets Regulator. \39\ See Financial Services Regulatory Reform: Discussion and Recommendations, which is available at http://www.ici.org/pdf/ ppr_09_reg_reform.pdf. We note that the white paper was included as an attachment to ICI's written testimony. Agency Funding, and Staffing: ICI consistently has called for adequate funding for the SEC in order to support its critical regulatory functions. We note that, in testimony before the House Financial Services Committee in March of this year, SEC Commissioner Elisse Walter stated that the SEC's examination and enforcement resources are inadequate to keep pace with the growth and innovation in the securities markets. \40\ We believe that Congress must seriously consider any suggestion from senior SEC officials that additional resources are required. We were pleased, therefore, to hear about the recent bipartisan effort, led by Senators Charles Schumer (D- NY) and Richard Shelby (R-AL) and endorsed by SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, to increase the SEC's budget by $20 million for fiscal years 2010 and 2011 in order to add enforcement staff and fund needed technology upgrades. \40\ See Testimony of Elisse B. Walter, Commissioner, U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Before the House Committee on Financial Services, Concerning Securities Law Enforcement in the Current Financial Crisis (March 20, 2009) at 30-31. ICI believes that the agency also must have greater ability (and resources) to attract and retain professional staff having significant prior industry experience. Their practical perspectives would enhance the agency's ability to keep current with market and industry developments and better understand the impact of such developments on regulatory policy. The SEC's announcement of a new Industry and Market Fellows Program is an encouraging step in the right direction. \41\ As discussed further below, the agency also should build strong economic research and analytical capabilities and should consider having economists resident in each division. \41\ See SEC Announces New Initiative to Identify and Assess Risks in Financial Markets (April 30, 2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/ news/press/2009/2009-98.htm Examination of the recent financial crisis has prompted calls for Congress to close regulatory gaps to ensure appropriate oversight of all market participants and investment products. In our white paper, we recommend that the Capital Markets Regulator (or SEC) have express regulatory authority to provide oversight with regard to hedge funds, derivatives, and municipal securities. To the extent that the scope of the agency's responsibilities is expanded, it will be imperative that it have sufficient staffing and resources to effectively perform all of its oversight functions. Agency Management and Organization: How a regulatory agency is managed, and the details of its organizational structure, can have significant implications for the agency's effectiveness. In our white paper, we offer the following suggestions with regard to agency management and organization. LEnsure high-level focus on agency management. One approach would be to designate a Chief Operating Officer for this purpose. LImplement a comprehensive process for setting regulatory priorities and assessing progress. It may be helpful to draw upon the experience of the United Kingdom's Financial Services Authority, which seeks to follow a methodical approach that includes developing a detailed annual business plan establishing agency priorities and then reporting annually the agency's progress in meeting prescribed benchmarks. LPromote open and effective lines of communication among the Commissioners and between the Commissioners and staff. Such communication is critical to fostering awareness of issues and problems as they arise, thus increasing the likelihood that the agency will be able to act promptly and effectively. A range of approaches may be appropriate to consider in meeting this goal, including whether sufficient flexibility is provided under the Government in the Sunshine Act, and whether the number of Commissioners should be greater than the current number at the SEC (five). LAlign the inspections and examinations functions and the policymaking divisions. This approach would have the benefit of keeping staff in the policymaking divisions updated on current market and industry developments, as well as precluding any de facto rulemaking by the agency's inspections staff. LDevelop mechanisms to facilitate coordination and information sharing among the policymaking divisions. These mechanisms would help to ensure that the agency speaks with one voice. Improving Agency Effectiveness: Our white paper recommends the following additional ways to enhance the agency's ability to fulfill its mission successfully when carrying out its regulatory responsibilities: 1. LEstablish the conditions necessary for constructive, ongoing dialogue with the regulated industry: The agency should seek to facilitate closer, cooperative interaction with the entities it regulates to identify and resolve problems, to determine the impact of problems or practices on investors and the market, and to cooperatively develop best practices that can be shared broadly with market participants. Incorporating a more preventative approach would likely encourage firms to step forward with self-identified problems and proposed resolutions. The net result is that the agency would pursue its investor protection responsibilities through various means not always involving enforcement measures, although strong enforcement must remain an important weapon in the agency's arsenal. 2. LEstablish mechanisms to stay abreast of market and industry developments: The agency would benefit from the establishment of one or more external mechanisms designed to help it stay abreast of market and industry issues and developments, including developments and practices in non-U.S. jurisdictions as appropriate. For example, several Federal agencies--including both the SEC and CFTC--utilize a range of advisory committees. Such committees, which generally have significant private sector representation, may be established to provide recommendations on a discrete set of issues facing the agency (e.g., the SEC's Advisory Committee on Improvements to Financial Reporting) or to provide regular information and guidance to the agency (e.g., the CFTC's Agricultural Advisory Committee). LICI believes that a multidisciplinary ``Capital Markets Advisory Committee'' could be a very effective mechanism for providing the agency with ``real world'' perspectives and insights on an ongoing basis. We recommend that such a committee be comprised primarily of private sector representatives from all major sectors of the capital markets, and include one or more members representing funds and asset managers. Additionally, the Capital Markets Advisory Committee should be specifically established in, and required by, legislation. Such a statutory mandate would emphasize the importance of this advisory committee to the agency's successful fulfillment of its mission. LThe establishment of an advisory committee would complement other efforts by the agency to monitor developments affecting the capital markets and market participants. These efforts should include, first and foremost, hiring more staff members with significant prior industry experience. As indicated above, their practical perspectives would enhance the agency's ability to keep current with market and industry developments and better understand the impact of such developments on regulatory policy. 3. LApply reasonably comparable regulation to like products and services: Different investment products often are subject to different regulatory requirements, often with good reason. At times, however, heavier regulatory burdens have been placed on some investment products or services than on others, even where they share similar features and are sold to the same customer base. It does not serve investors well if the regulatory requirements placed on funds--which serve over 93 million investors--end up discouraging investment advisers from entering or remaining in the fund business, dissuading portfolio managers from managing funds as opposed to other investment products, or creating disincentives for brokers and other intermediaries to sell fund shares. It is critically important for the agency to be sensitive to this dynamic in its rulemakings. LAmong other things, in analyzing potential new regulatory requirements for funds or in other situations as appropriate, the agency should consider whether other investment products raise similar policy concerns and thus should be subject to comparable requirements. In this regard, we note that separately managed accounts sometimes are operated much like mutual funds and other investment companies and yet do not offer the same level of investor protection. For example, as the fallout from the Ponzi scheme perpetrated by Bernard Madoff has highlighted, separately managed accounts are not subject to all of the restrictions on custody arrangements that serve to protect fund assets, and existing rules leave room for abuse. \42\ \42\ The SEC has scheduled an open meeting on May 14, 2009, at which it will consider proposed rule amendments designed to enhance the protections provided to advisory clients when they entrust their funds and securities to an investment adviser. The SEC's meeting announcement indicates that if adopted, the amendments would require investment advisers having custody of client funds and securities to obtain a surprise examination by an independent public accountant, and, unless the client assets are maintained with an independent custodian, obtain a review of custodial controls from an independent public accountant. See SEC News Digest (May 7, 2009), available at http://www.sec.gov/ news/digest/2009/dig050709.htm 4. LDevelop strong capability to conduct economic analysis to support sound rulemaking and oversight: The agency will be best positioned to accomplish its mission if it conducts economic analysis in various aspects of the agency's work, including rulemaking, examinations, and enforcement. Building strong economic research and analytical capabilities is an important way to enhance the mix of disciplines that will inform the agency's activities. From helping the agency look at broad trends that shed light on how markets or individual firms are operating to enabling it to demonstrate that specific policy initiatives are well-grounded, developing the agency's capability to conduct economic analysis will be well worth the long-term effort required. The agency should consider having economists resident in each division to bring additional, important perspectives to bear on regulatory challenges. LIt is important that economic analysis play an integral role in the rulemaking process, because many regulatory costs ultimately are borne by investors. When new regulations are required, or existing regulations are amended, the agency should thoroughly examine all possible options and choose the alternative that reflects the best trade-off between costs to, and benefits for, investors. Effective cost benefit analysis does not mean compromising protections for investors or the capital markets. Rather, it challenges the regulator to consider alternative proposals and think creatively to achieve appropriate protections while minimizing regulatory burdens, or to demonstrate that a proposal's costs and burdens are justified in light of the nature and extent of the benefits that will be achieved. \43\ \43\ See, e.g., Special Report on Regulatory Reform, Congressional Oversight Panel (submitted under Section 125(b)(2) of Title I of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008) (Jan. 2009) (``In tailoring regulatory responses . . . the goal should always be to strike a reasonable balance between the costs of regulation and its benefits. Just as speed limits are more stringent on busy city streets than on open highways, financial regulation should be strictest where the threats-especially the threats to other citizens--are greatest, and it should be more moderate elsewhere.''). 5. LModernize regulations that no longer reflect current market structures and practices: Financial markets and related services are constantly evolving, frequently at a pace that can make the regulations governing them (or the rationale behind those regulations) become less than optimal, if not entirely obsolete. Requiring industry participants to comply with outmoded regulations imposes unnecessary costs on both firms and investors, may impede innovation, and, most troubling of all, could result in inadequate protection of investors. It is thus important that the agency engage in periodic reviews of its existing regulations to determine whether any such regulations should be modernized or eliminated. 6. LGive heightened attention to investor education: The recent turmoil in the financial markets has underscored how important it is that investors be knowledgeable and understand their investments. Well-informed investors are more likely to develop realistic expectations, take a long-term perspective, and understand the trade-off between risk and reward. They are less likely to panic and make mistakes. LTo better equip investors to make good decisions about their investments, the agency should assign a high priority to pursuing regulatory initiatives that will help educate investors. The SEC has an Office of Investor Education and Advocacy and provides some investor education resources on its Web site. These types of efforts should be expanded, possibly in partnership with other governmental or private entities, and better publicized. Many industry participants, too, have developed materials and other tools to help educate investors; additional investor outreach efforts should be encouraged. Q.10. Systemic Risk Regulatory Structure: You have put forth the idea of a systemic risk regulator that is organized as a committee of financial regulatory heads. Could you please elaborate on the structure and organization of such a systemic risk regulatory you are suggesting? Also, please describe the positives and negatives of such an arrangement and the reasons why it would be superior to other possibilities. A.10. In light of the financial crisis, it is imperative that Congress establish in statute responsibility to address risks to the financial system at large. For certain specific and identifiable purposes, such as assuring effective consolidated global supervision of the largest bank holding companies and overseeing the robust functioning of the payment and settlement system as appropriate, this systemic risk management responsibility might be lodged with the Federal Reserve Board. Beyond this context, however, I recommend that systemic risk management responsibility should be assigned to a statutory council comprised of senior Federal regulators. In concept, such a council would be similar to the National Security Council (NSC), which was established by the National Security Act of 1947. In the aftermath of World War II, Congress recognized the need to assure better coordination and integration of ``domestic, foreign, and military policies relating to the national security'' and the ongoing assessment of ``policies, objectives, and risks.'' The 1947 Act established the NSC under the President as a Cabinet-level council with a dedicated staff. In succeeding years, the NSC has proved to be a key mechanism utilized by Presidents to address the increasingly complex and multi-faceted challenges of national security policy. It was my honor from 1987-89 to serve as statutory head (i.e., Executive Secretary) of the NSC. As with national security, addressing risks to the financial system at large requires, in my view, diverse inputs and perspectives. Membership of such a council accordingly should draw upon a broad base of expertise, and should include at a minimum the Secretary of the Treasury, Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, and the heads of the Federal bank and capital markets regulators (and insurance regulator, if one emerges at the Federal level). As with the NSC, flexibility should exist to enlist other regulators into the work of the council on specific issues as required--including, for example, State insurance regulators and self-regulatory organizations. By statute, the council should have a mandate to monitor conditions and developments in the domestic and international financial markets, to assess their implications for the health of the financial system at large, to identify regulatory actions to be taken to address systemic risks as they emerge, to assess the effectiveness of these actions, and to advise the President and the Congress on emerging risks and necessary legislative or regulatory responses. The council would be responsible for coordinating and integrating the national response to systemic financial risks, but it would not have a direct operating role (much as the NSC coordinates and integrates military and foreign policy that is implemented by the Defense or State Department and not by the NSC itself). Rather, responsibility for addressing identified risks would lie with the existing functional regulators, who would act pursuant to their normal statutory authorities but under the council's direction. The Secretary of the Treasury, as the senior-most member of the council, should be designated chairman. An executive director, appointed by the President, should run the day-to-day operations of the council and serve as head of the council's staff. The council should meet on a regular basis, with an interagency process coordinated through the council's staff to support and follow through on its ongoing deliberations. To accomplish its mission, the council should have the support of a dedicated, highly-experienced staff. The staff should represent a mix of disciplines (e.g., economics, finance and law) and should consist of individuals seconded from government departments and agencies (Federal and state), as well as recruited from the private sector with a business, professional or academic background. As with the NSC, the staff's focus would be to support the work of the council as such, and thus the staff would operate independently from the functional regulators. Nonetheless, the background and experience of the staff would help assure the kind of strong working relationships with the functional regulators necessary for the council's success. Such a staff could be recruited and at work in a relatively short period of time. The focus in recruiting such a staff should be on quality, not quantity, and the council's staff accordingly should not and need not be large. Such a council structure has many advantages to recommend it: LSystemic risks may arise in different ways and affect different parts of the domestic and global financial system. No existing agency or department has a comprehensive frame of reference or the necessary expertise to assess and respond to any and all such risks. Creating such an all-purpose systemic risk manager would be a long and complex undertaking, and would involve developing expertise that duplicates that which exists in today's functional regulators. The council structure by contrast would enlist the expertise of the entire regulatory community in identifying and devising strategies to mitigate systemic risks. It also could be established and begin operation much more quickly. LThe council structure would avoid risks inherent in the leading alternative that has been proposed--i.e., designating an existing agency like the Federal Reserve Board to serve as an all-purpose systemic risk regulator. In this role, the Federal Reserve understandably may tend to view risks and risk mitigation through its lens as a bank regulator focused on prudential regulation and ``safety and soundness'' concerns, potentially to the detriment of consumer and investor protection concerns and of non-bank financial institutions. In my view, a council such as I have outlined would bring all these competing perspectives to bear and, as a result, would seem far more likely to strike the proper balance. LSuch a council would provide a high degree of flexibility in convening those Federal and State regulators whose input and participation is necessary to addressing a specific issue, without creating an unwieldy or bureaucratic structure. As is the case with the NSC, the council should have a core membership of senior Federal officials and the ability to expand its participants on an ad hoc basis when a given issue so requires. LWith an independent staff dedicated solely to pursuing the council's agenda, the council would be well positioned to test or challenge the policy judgments or priorities of various functional regulators. Moreover, by virtue of their participation on the council, the various functional regulators are themselves likely to be more attentive to emerging risks or regulatory gaps. This would help assure a far more coordinated and integrated approach. Over time, the council also would assist in identifying and promoting political consensus about significant regulatory gaps and necessary policy responses. LThe council model anticipates that functional regulators, as distinct from the council itself, would be charged with implementing regulations to mitigate systemic risks as they emerge. This operational role is appropriate because the functional regulators will have the greatest in depth knowledge of their respective regulated industries. Nonetheless, the council and its staff will have an important independent role in evaluating the effectiveness of the measures taken by functional regulators to mitigate systemic risk and, where necessary, in prompting further actions. LA potential criticism of the council structure is that it may diffuse responsibility and pose difficulties in assuring proper follow-through by the functional regulators. I agree it is important that the council have ``teeth,'' and this can be accomplished, in crafting the legislation, through appropriate amendments to the organic statutes governing the functional regulators.","Speech"," "
