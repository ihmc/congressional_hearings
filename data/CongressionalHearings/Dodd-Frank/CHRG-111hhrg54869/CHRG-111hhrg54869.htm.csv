"The Chairman","This hearing of the Committee on Financial Services will come to order. We will be having this hearing today and one tomorrow-- well, actually, this is the last of the general hearings that we will be having on this subject. Tomorrow, we will begin legislative hearings because we will have a hearing tomorrow on the legislation submitted by our colleague, Mr. Paul of Texas, which is a piece of legislation dealing with auditing of the Federal Reserve. And we are concluding today, and one topic that has been a very significant concern is that there is universal dislike of the doctrine of ``too-big-to-fail'' and even more, the practice of ``too-big-to-fail.'' Unfortunately, there does not appear to be a single, simple solution to it. Passing a statute that says nobody is ``too-big-to-fail'' doesn't resolve the problem. One of our major goals in drafting legislation has been to come up with a series of measures that will avoid our facing that situation of ``too-big-to-fail.'' We will try to keep institutions from being so overleveraged that they are likely to fail. We will try to prevent imprudent decisions, for instance, that come from 100 percent securitization that come from derivatives that are overly leveraged without sufficient collateral. We will give some collection of Federal agencies the authority to step in when it appears that institutions or patterns of activity are being systemically threatening and order containment of these activities; and we will have, what I guess I am destined to have to continue to refer to as the ``resolution authority'' which, in English, is the ``dissolution authority,'' the ability of regulators to step in and put an institution to death without the kind of tremors that occurred or will occur today. Now there does appear to be broad agreement, I think, in the committee on all sides about those goals. How we do them we will differ about. But it was clear yesterday that no one thinks that the current choice of straight bankruptcy or nothing is workable for the institutions. We have to come up with a method of resolving. We have done that, and we shouldn't deny ourselves the regular sum successes. Where insured depository institutions are involved, we have a system that works pretty well. Wachovia is a pretty big institution. It failed. This didn't cause systemic disruption. It wasn't good for the people who were there. Other insured depository institutions have failed, and we have been able to deal with that. We need to extend that. On the other hand, non-depository institutions, Bear Stearns, Merrill Lynch, AIG, and Lehman Brothers all failed, and all were dealt with--each of these was dealt with in a different way and none were satisfactory to anybody, as nearly as I can see. A forced takeover of Merrill Lynch by Bank of America, the negative consequences of that are still reverberating. Paying nobody in the case of Lehman Brothers, none of the creditors, and causing, according to the Administration officials at the time, a terrible shock to the system; paying everybody in AIG, which no one, except the people who got paid, thinks was a good idea now. And Bear Stearns, which was the smallest of them and actually was probably handled in the least disruptive way but still because it was that hot caused some problems. So one of the things we expect people to address today, I hope they will address today, is what combination of measures we can take to get rid of the doctrine of ``too-big-to-fail.'' There was one proposal that came from some within the Administration that we would have a list of the institutions that would be considered ``too-big-to-fail,'' a list of the systemically important institutions so that we could deal with them, but the general view was that would be considered to be the list of those ``too-big-to-fail,'' and what the Administration thought would be a scarlet letter, would instead be a license to have people invest with you because they would think they were protected. So as I said, it is a high priority for this committee to deal with that and to have as nearly as it is humanly possible, a banishment from people's minds. I will say this. I am resigned to the fact that cultural lag is one of the great constraints on what we do. And I accept the fact that until we reach the point where a large institution is put to death without there being ``pay everybody'' or other inappropriate compensations, people won't believe us. We can arm the regulators to do this, we can arm people to do it, and I accept the fact that not until it is done will people believe it. But I will say this: When people are skeptical, listen to the members of this committee and our colleagues. We will give the regulators the power to step in and make it clear that no one is ``too-big-to-fail,'' that failure will eventuate, that it will be painful for those involved. There will be no moral hazard, no temptation to get that big. Any regulator who failed to use that power in the foreseeable future will, I think, feel a uniform wrath from this place. So I would hope that people would be a little less skeptical. We are not going away. The country's anger about this isn't going away. So we aren't just setting up the tools; we are arming ourselves in a way that I think will be very effective. The gentleman from Alabama is now recognized for 5 minutes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","I thank the chairman, and I agree with him that the problem of ``too-big-to-fail'' is one of the most pressing and contentious issues of the regulatory reform and debate. And how that is resolved I think will go a long way to moving regulatory reform ahead. Chairman Volcker, we know you as a gentleman and also someone whose opinion we respect very much. So we welcome you to this committee hearing. And I know you share some of the same concerns that the chairman shares and that I share and that most of our colleagues share. The chairman yesterday in the hearing with Treasury Secretary Geithner identified the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem as the one that most aggravates people in this country. And I agree with you, Chairman Frank, it not only aggravates them, it outrages them on many occasions. The American taxpayers are tired of paying for Wall Street's mistakes, our guaranteeing their obligations. They see something manifestly and something wrong with a casino environment in which high rollers pocket the profits, often measured in millions, if not billions, of dollars while the taxpayers pay off the losses. The American people are justifiably outraged by a ``heads I win, tails you lose'' approach. When we designate 10 or 20 of our largest financial institutions as ``too-big-to-fail,'' we endorse a financial marketplace in which a handful of enormous financial institutions are supported by the promise of government-engineered, taxpayer-funded bailouts. We also pull people in, assuming they will be saved and assuming there is a guarantee. The time has come for every member of this body to reject once and for all the concept of taxpayer bailouts of these so- called ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions. Equally important is the fact that in concept and in practice, ``too-big-to-fail'' necessarily creates a much larger universe of companies and businesses which are deemed unworthy and too small to save. To establish, as law, such a disparate, inequitable, and discriminatory treatment not only should offend our sense of fair play and justice, its elitist operation should be rejected out of hand as contrary to our democratic principles. The Administration wants to codify a permanent bailout authority with its proposal to create a resolution authority. It really is a permanent TARP administered by government bureaucrats with even less accountability than was present in the current incarnation of TARP. The beneficiaries of the Administration's plan are not the American people or the vast majority of small- and medium-sized companies and businesses that choose not to engage in the kind of risky financial activity that led to the financial market collapse. The more responsible individuals of the institutions and inevitably the taxpayers will pay for the bailouts but they will not benefit. Indeed, just yesterday, in testimony before this committee, Treasury Secretary Geithner declined repeated invitations to rule out future taxpayer-funded rescues of systemically significant firms. In response to my question about taking assistance to these firms off the table, Secretary Geithner compared such an action as abolishing the fire station, which I took to mean he would not agree to stop bailouts. And when asked repeatedly by Congressman Brad Sherman, if the Secretary would accept even a trillion dollar limit on bailout authority, Secretary Geithner said, ``I would not.'' In conclusion, by contrast, Republicans have offered a workable alternative to the bailout status quo. In addition to curtailing the Fed's authority to bail out individual firms, Republicans support enhanced bankruptcy for failed nonbank financial institutions similar to the authorities that the FDIC has for banks. By sending a clear, credible signal to the marketplace that failed nonbank financial firms will face bankruptcy and need to plan accordingly, and the people who do business with them, the Republican plan restores market discipline, mitigates moral hazard, and protects taxpayers. Mr. Chairman, no institution should be ``too-big-to-fail.'' Institutions can and should fail if their bad decisions render them insolvent and they cannot compete in the marketplace. To pretend otherwise is to weaken the foundation of our economic system. The better question is, will we have the courage to do the right thing, and reject the Administration's effort to move us to a system of gigantic but weak banks kept on--well, that is it. And these are real questions. I thank the chairman, and I also thank the former Chairman of the Fed for being with us today.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 3 minutes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Mr. Volcker. We are at a juncture in our dealing with this in terms of putting the regulatory reforms to--I think at the same time do a little check on our record going forward of how well what we have done and is it doing the job? The American people are registering some great concerns. Poll after poll has indicated that there is a--while Wall Street and those at the top appear to be saying that this economy is changing, we are bottoming out. That is not so on Main Street because we have another set of parameters that are working there. And I would like to get your opinions on--I have a great deal of respect for you and your history and your knowledge. But I think as we look at this issue, we need to be concerned about any variations of what we would refer to as a double dip recession. There are people who are still expressing concerns over the economy and problems that will loom greater. I am particularly concerned, Mr. Volcker, about unemployment. The issue in our focus really needs to be on jobs now because if we don't get to the bottom of that we gradually begin to lose the faith of the American people. The issue needs to be on jobs, the issue needs to be on our banks. For some reason, with all of the money we have given them, with the bailouts we have given them, with many of them going back to their ways of directing bonuses and huge salaries, there is a hypocritical nature that is setting in because at the same time, these banks are not lending. So if you are not lending, especially to small businesses, they are going out of business. They are the ones that created the jobs. So I think as we go forward with our regulatory reforms we have to look at it with a very jaundiced eye and see as we put these regulatory reforms in place, what more can we do to prime the pump to get money flowing out into the communities. The other area of great concern to me--and certainly to my folks down in Georgia--is a record number of bank closures. And as we look at these regulatory reforms, one size does not fit all. What is the future of those small community banks that basically do the lending, that are the foundations in many of our smaller communities? Those are the banks that are being closed left and right. We lead the Nation in Georgia in those bank closures, and a part of the reason is they can't get the capitalization. So I think as we go forward I would be very interested to hear some of your concerns on giving us a scorecard, giving us a report card. We have been at this now for basically a year. This thing happened a year ago. We have been moving at it, and I think it is about time to get a little report, and I would be interested to hear your comments on that.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Delaware is recognized for 1\1/2\ minutes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I actually do not have an opening statement. I don't know if the ranking member wanted to add to his time.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","I was given a list by the minority. I wasn't trying to draft you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Castle","I will yield back my time, maybe in the hopes of actually hearing a witness.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The other two listed aren't here. I have 2 minutes from Mr. Green, and we can proceed. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 2 minutes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Volcker, for being here. Mr. Volcker, sir, you are a sage, and we welcome your attendance. I eagerly anticipate what you have to tell us. You have shepherded this country in some very difficult times, and I think you should be commended for your history of being there when your country needed you. I want to concur with the ranking member when he talks of ``too-big-to-fail'' because quite candidly, I agree. ``Too-big- to-fail'' is the right size to regulate, but it is also the right size to prevent from becoming ``too-big-to-fail,'' and it is the right size to put in a position such that we can wind it down without costing the taxpayers any dollars. The idea is not to bail out ``too-big-to-fail,'' it is to put those that may be ``too-big-to-fail'' in such a position that we can wind them down and not allow another AIG to prevail. That is what it is really all about. We also want to do this. We don't want to put ourselves in a position where we are designating by way of a list. We want to regulate such that we don't have to designate. As a company, AIG starts to become so large that it may fail, we want to start the regulatory process such that it won't get there, and if indeed it does by some accident, then we want to have a way to do what we do with banks in this country, and that is wind them down and not cost the taxpayers any dollars. Finally, this: There is, I believe, a desire on this side to work with persons on the other side to accomplish this mission. I am willing to work with the ranking member and anyone else who would like to put us in a position such that we don't ever have to deal with another ``too-big-to-fail,'' such that we will always have that safety net to protect the American economy. Nobody was bailing out AIG. We bailed out the American economy, and in fact we were bailing out the economy on a global basis as well. I thank you for your sage advice and look forward to hearing from you. I thank you, Mr. Chairman",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Mr. Volcker, we thank you for joining us. Mr. Volcker has a very long list of titles which, under the 5- minute rule, I could not finish reading even at my speed. But we are very pleased that he came up today, especially to share his experiences with us. Please, Mr. Volcker.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and members of the committee. It has been a long time since I have been in the room. It is a familiar room, and I appreciate the opportunity because you are dealing with particularly important problems. Let me just say in a preliminary way, as you know, the President has said--as Mr. Geithner has said, if the market betters, the economy steadying, there has been some feeling of relaxation about some of these issues and some feeling of maybe just return to business as usual, return to making money, outside amounts of money, certain resistance to change. And from the comments that you have made, I am sure you will not respond to that by slowing down, but rather proceeding with all deliberate speed to get this right. It is really important. It is an incredibly complicated problem, and I want to concentrate on mainly the aspect that you have already emphasized. But before I do so, let me acknowledge that an awful lot of work is going on in various aspects by the regulatory agencies. They have taken important initiatives dealing with capital and liquidity, and they are working toward compensation practices. And I would point out it is relevant with the G-20 meeting that a lot of what needs to be done really does require a certain consistency internationally because these markets are global and that just adds another complication. You can't have capital requirements, for instance, for American banks that are way out of line of capital requirements elsewhere, to take an easy example. But that is an additional complication. But the central issue that I want to talk about really is what you have already said, moral hazard in financial markets. You know what that is all about. I don't have to explain it. But I would note that this is front and center because the active use of long-dormant emergency powers of the Federal Reserve together with extraordinary action by the Treasury and Congress to support non-bank institutions has extended this issue well beyond the world of commercial banking. ``Too-big- to-fail'' has been an issue in commercial banking; now it is an issue for finance generally. I think it raises very important substantive questions. It raises some administrative questions that I want to touch upon, too. It raise legal questions. And one of those questions is the role of the Federal Reserve, which I will return to. In dealing with that, I submitted a long statement which deals with all of this in more detail. Just to cut to the chase, you know, the Administration has set out a possible approach, which I feel somewhat resistant to or more than somewhat resistant because I think it does suffer from conceptual and practical difficulties. Now what they suggested is setting out a group of particular institutions that, in their judgment, would pose a systemic risk in the event of failure. I don't know what criteria would be used precisely in determining these institutions because the market changes, it is not always directly relevant to size. That in itself would be a great challenge. But I think it is fair to say that the great majority of systemically important institutions are today, and likely to be in the future, the mega-commercial banks. We are talking about in the center of things, the commercial banking problem. That is true here, that is true abroad, and in this case we already have an established safety net. The commercial banks that are at the heart of the problem are already subject to deposit insurance, central bank credit facilities, and other means of support. I have a little hobby of asking friends and acquaintances when they talk to me with experience in financial markets, I say, Now, outside of commercial banks, outside of insurance companies, which I would say parenthetically I hope better regulatory systems will be developed, maybe not as part of this legislation but next year. Apart from commercial banks and insurance companies, how many genuinely systemically important institutions do you think there are in the whole world, financial markets. I will tell you the answer I get consistently is somewhere between 5 and 25. The universe is not huge when you are talking about non-banking, non-insurance company, systemically important institutions. Now, if you extend this idea of developing a group of systemically important institutions for your own banks, then the moral hazards problem has obviously increased because the connotation is if they are systemically important, officially identified, they fall in the same category as banks, and the government better be especially alert to dealing with them in case of difficulty. Now, it does seem to me a better approach would be to confine the safety net to where it is, that is to commercial banking organizations. And as part of that organization now and even more so in the future, the banking supervisors would, I think, as a natural part of their responsibility, be especially attentive to the risks posed by the largest banking organizations. So they ought to have the discipline to insist upon best practice among those organizations, not just in the United States but generally worldwide by agreement. We have to agree to more adequate capital, responsible cooperation with other supervisory concerns, and leave it as ambiguous as you can as to whether government assistance would ever be provided in these emergency situations. Now that approach recognizes, I think, the reality that the commercial banks are the indispensable backbone of the financial system. Mr. Scott talked a bit about the importance of community banks, regional banks and credit. That is part of it. They also act as depository, they take care of the payment system, they offer investment advice, they maintain international financial flows. These are all essential services that justify a special sense of protection. Now, when you get to what are called capital market activity, a lot of trading, hedge funds, private equity funds, a lot of other activity, credit default swaps,CDOs, CDO squared, all that stuff, it is a different business. It is an impersonal position. It is a trading business, and it is useful. We need strong capital markets, but they are not the same as customer-related commercial banking functions and they do have substantial risks. Banking itself is risky enough. You add capital market operations to that, you are just compounding the risk. And I would note it is--they present conflicts of interest for customer relationships. When a bank is rendering advice and maybe investment advice to a company, it is rendering underwriting services and then it is turning around and creating in those same activities, does it bias the customer advice? Does it undercut the customer relationship? Is it consistent with the customer relationship? Those problems are enormously difficult, and I think demonstrably have been a big distraction for bank management and led to weaknesses in risk management practices. So I would say the logic of this situation is to prohibit the banking organizations, and by ``banking organizations,'' I am talking about the bank and its holding company and all of the related operations. I would prohibit them from sponsoring or capitalizing hedge funds, private equity funds, and I would have particularly strict supervision enforced by capital and collateral requirements toward proprietary trading in securities and derivatives. Now, how do you approach all of this and deal with the big nonbank that might get in trouble? That I think is where this resolution authority comes into play. Can we have a system, knowledge as to what we have with banks, a government authority can take over a failed or failing institution, manage that institution, try to find a merger partner if that is reasonable, force the end of the equity if there is no equity really left in the company, ask debt holders, negotiate with debt holders to exchange dept for equity to make the company solvent again, if that is possible. If none of that is possible, arrange an orderly liquidation. And none of that necessarily involves the injection of government money and taxpayer money but it provides an organized procedure for letting down what I hope is a very rare occurrence of the failure of a systemically important nonbank institution. Now who has all of this authority and how are the general regulatory and supervisory arrangements rejiggered, if at all, and I do think they do need some rejiggering. I would mention one aspect of that. The Treasury itself has correctly identified the need for what I call an overseer. Somebody, some organization that is responsible not just for individual institutions but responsible for surveying the whole financial system, identifying points of weakness, which may or may not lie in an individual institution. It may lie in new trading developments. But take two obvious examples. Who was alert to the rise of the subprime mortgage a few years ago? It may not have appeared to have presented a risk at the time for an individual institution, but it sure in its speed of increase and its weakness presented a risk to the whole system. Somebody should have been alerted to that. Who has been looking at credit default swaps and wondering whether they reach the point of creating a threat to the system? And the answer is basically nobody and not very well. And somebody should have that responsibility. The Treasury has been very eloquent on that point. They have suggested a kind of council or regulatory agency headed by the Treasury. I frankly don't think that is a very effective way to do it because getting a bunch of agencies together and getting to agreement on anything, and they all have their particular responsibilities, their particular constituencies are a very tough business. So if you do it that way you have to be a Treasury. You have to build up a new staff in the Treasury. The alternative is the Federal Reserve. I spent a lot of time in the Treasury so I am not particularly prejudiced of the Federal Reserve, I would argue, but I think this is a natural function for the Federal Reserve. I think consciously or unconsciously we have looked to the Federal Reserve. Whether the responsibility has been discharged effectively or not, there is a sense that the Federal Reserve is the agency, the major agency to be concerned with the whole financial market, and there is no doubt when you get in trouble, when anybody in the financial markets gets in real trouble they run to the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve has the authority, the money. It presumably has the experience and capabilities, and I think that simple fact ought to be recognized. It is a very important institution. It seems to be logical that they ought to be kind of assigned explicitly what I always thought they had implicitly, a kind of surveillance of a whole system.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE PAUL A. VOLCKER, FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
"The Chairman","Obviously, this has been very helpful on a broad range. I want to talk about one issue that you care a lot about and in which your experience really gives you a great deal of authority. It hasn't gotten much attention, and that is the concern you have about the problems raised by proprietary trading within the banks, the bank holding companies. You have some fairly strong views about restricting that. You mentioned it, but I would ask you to elaborate on that because I think that is, as I look at it, is one of the important topics. It hasn't gotten discussed much. I know it was raised by some others, there is Mr. Levitt, Ms. Donaldson who had that in their--I think in their investors' list of concerns. So is it feasible to just ban it, or how would you deal with the question of proprietary trading by the institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","When I comment that I think banks should be restricted in their, what I think of as truly capital market impersonal activity, it is pretty easy to talk about hedge funds and equity funds because they are identifiable institutions. Proprietary trading is not an identifiable institution in the same way, although many financial institutions will have a proprietary trading desk. That is the way they label it themselves.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","That is the way they have labeled it, before you get through. That is the way it has traditionally been labeled by some, but by the time you are through testifying, they will probably have a new name for it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","However it is labeled, I think conceptually there is a difference and can't be denied that a company, a bank, or whatever it is, is trading actively in the market, the securities that bear no customer relationship, no continuing interest. They are interested in making a profit on a particular trade or making a speculative profit. And that activity, in some institutions anyway, has become increasingly important and it is inherently risky, it inherently presents a conflict of interest. It inherently is hard to manage. Some people are good at it, some people are not so good at it. It takes a lot of concentration. How do you deal with it because there is some perfectly legitimate trading that goes on in a bank or financial institution, and it is an outgrowth of their customer interest. If they are underwriting securities and lending securities for a particular customer, they may want to trade in those securities that they have underwritten, to take a simple example. And if they are going to do some trading, they have to maintain a certain liquidity, a certain staff that is able do that. How do you distinguish between a kind of routine, low- level trading activity and proprietary trading as an active part of the money making business of the firm? It is partly a matter of judgment and partly a matter of volume, but I think what you have to rely upon is supervisory discretion. You tell the supervisor that part of the concern of banking regulation should be cutting down on this kind of speculative activity, trading activity. And the supervisor certainly has the authority to arrange capital requirements that could be increasingly severe as the trading activity increased, and they could take other supervisory steps to assure that trading activity is in reasonable alignment with the customer orientation of the banks.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Thank you. So in essence, this is something that could be handled by underlining the supervisory authority, not by some kind of statutory bar but in the statute make it very explicit the grants of authority.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I don't think you can write a bright line law to say what is proprietary and what isn't.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Just to be clear, because in the legislation we have been contemplating, that is already clearly identified as one of the tools that could be used in an institution which is being treated as a systemic risk. But your point is that it ought to be a generic authority and that it is not a matter of the systemic risk but is a conflict in other ways. On the question of the death panels, which is otherwise called the resolving authority--``death panel'' has such a wonderful ring to it. Just because it is entirely inaccurate in one area, it doesn't mean it should pass from the debate. I think we ought to--we will save the phrase and use it where it makes some sense, and that is the resolving authority. On the question about whether or not they should--I am out of time. So let me pose the question and you can elaborate on it. There is obviously a big debate about whether or not public funds ought ever to be available in resolving the mess left behind by one of these institutions. If you could answer it briefly now and elaborate in writing, I would appreciate that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","In terms of the resolution authority, which would give extraordinary authority to whatever agency is designated to control the institution, I do not think it is desirable to provide in that same arrangement authority to lend money or to provide money because that will encourage the ``too-big-to-fail'' kind of syndrome. So if you give it strong enough authority to control the institution and to manage such things as forcing, negotiating or forcing, whatever word you want use, let us say a conversion of debt into equity, hopefully you would avoid the need for injecting money and the stockholder would lose, the creditor might lose, and the creditor should be concerned about whether he is going to lose. Now, I would also say--I guess I didn't mention in this preliminary statement--that if the overseer, for instance, identified an institution or several institutions as being so large and so extended as to present a real risk, there would be some residual authority to place capital requirements on that institution, leverage requirements, maybe liquidity requirements. But that doesn't involve government money.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","I appreciate it. The gentleman from Alabama.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","I thank the chairman. Chairman Volcker, Secretary Geithner declined to rule out any more government bailouts of troubled institutions. And I think what we usually assume by that, we are not talking about the FDIC's traditional power to resolve depository institutions. He declined to do so. Do you think that is a mistake?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I would answer that question this way: I think you have the emergency power of the Federal Reserve, section 133. I am not proposing that be abolished. I have mixed feelings about that because I squirm when it is used, frankly. We spent a lot of time trying to avoid its use because we knew if it ever got used it would become a precedent for the future, and if we used it for New York, people will say we should use it for Chicago or the State of California. And we didn't use it for Chrysler 20 years ago, whenever it was. Well, demands arose because we didn't want to set the precedent of using it. Well, our precedent has been set now in very strange circumstances, very radical circumstances. So understandably, it has been set. But I think we want to develop attitudes and policies that say this is extremely extraordinary. It is part of the apparatus of the bank safety net, although it could be extended beyond that. I don't think I would promote that, but I wouldn't take it away.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","We have sort of scrambled the egg. We have the commercial banks and the investment banks. Last September, some of the investment banks came under the safety net--",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","--I think you have indicated, and I think many of us realize there is a difference in what was a commercial bank, a lending facility, and an investment or trading bank. In fact, if you look at the two investment banks, the two largest ones, their last report showed substantial profits from trading, which indicates a trade that they are still basically--their profits are being derived from trading derivatives and some of the things that you described. Do we go back to that system?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, we can have investment banks again. I guess there is only one big investment--well, two, one very active in trading, the other less active in trading. But I don't want those investment banks brought under the general safety net. There ought to be a distinction. And if they want to go out and do a lot of trading and that is a legitimate function, if they want to do whatever they want to do in the financial world, okay, but don't bring them under the safety net.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","And if they fail, they go into an enhanced--",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","If they fail, you use the resolution that is already as necessary.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","Let me ask you another question, and I really have two. One is I just want to acknowledge something and see--we did have--some of our failures were a result of the derivative trading and instruments that didn't exist 20 years ago. And you have talked about that. You had another problem and that is depository institutions that went out and bought subprime affiliates that were not regulated at all. And I think that was a tremendous threat to the system.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Absolutely.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","Would you comment on that? You could go down the list of banks.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","The subprime phenomena is interesting because, you know, I am not in the middle of the markets these days, and I wasn't conscious of the speed in which they were increasing. They were a phenomena of practically a standing start to a trillion, trillion and a half dollar business in the space of 3 or 4 years that arose very rapidly, and apparently there was no clear sense in the regulatory community of the potential threat that this posed; and it probably, because they were obscured by the same thing that obscured bank managements and others, that we had some fancy financial engineering here that somehow presto magic, the risks go away if we put it in a big package and get a good credit rating, which is what they were getting. But I think that was a failure in risk management, a failure of the credit rating agencies, but it also was a failure of the regulators that weren't on top of this. And this arose not in the traditional banks. They may have participated, and they did participate in the end, but it arose in kind of fringe operations, but nobody sat there and said look, this is a potential threat if it increases at this rate of speed to the financial system. Nobody that I know of. Somebody should have been raising that question. And in my view, you know, as the Federal Reserve was already given clearance to do it, they are in the best position to do it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Bachus","There were loans that banks couldn't make. They wouldn't make it under their own underwriting standards. They wouldn't originate them in the banks so they went out and bought an unregulated subprime lender to make loans that they would never make.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The Federal Reserve was given that authority in 1994 because that is exactly the authority that Mr. Bernanke invoked in 2007 when he did finally promulgate rules, but that was unchanged from the authority that existed from 1994. The gentleman from North Carolina.",Speech, 
"Mr. Watt","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Volcker, thank you for being here. I have been on this committee now for 17 years and there seem to be two acknowledged gurus in the financial services industry. Alan Greenspan was one. When he spoke, I never understood a darn thing that he ever said but he seemed very eloquent in his positions. And you are the second one, and I have heard you speak 3 times now. I understand, I think, what you are saying, but it seems to me that your testimony this morning and the other times that I have heard you address the systemic risk issue leads us back exactly to where we are right now. If we didn't do anything on systemic risk, we already have regulation of--we have all of the banks who are currently under regulations, and I am just trying to understand how--what you are proposing with respect to systemic risk differs from what we have now. That is the one question. And I am going to put both of them out there and then I will shut up and listen to you talk. The second question is, you have done a lot of work. I have read your report on the international monetary situation, and you led a group or participated in an international group that looked at this from an international perspective. And I didn't hear you address any of that this morning. I know we are here to deal with our domestic situation, but how do you see this being intertwined in the systemic issue being addressed on a worldwide basis unless we address it somehow more aggressively than you have proposed on the domestic side?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Two relevant questions. On the first question, I am not recommending anything particularly different so far as banks are concerned that already have lender of last resort, they already have deposit insurance, and we have some history of intervening with Federal Reserve money or government money in the case of failure of very large banking institutions. So that I take is a given. And that is common around the world. There isn't a developed country that doesn't have a similar system to protect banks because banks are, I think, the backbone of the system. Now it is also true in the United States the relevant importance of banks has declined in terms of giving credit because more of the credit creation has been going into securities, which is the province of the capital market. What is different is the situation has changed where some of the benefits anyway, the safety net, has been extended outside the banking system. That is what I want to change. But you can't change it just by saying it is not going to happen because you are going to have problems. You have to develop some other possibilities and arrangements to minimize the chances of a crisis. So that is what we are proposing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Watt","So basically what you are proposing is taking some of the people who are now covered under the FDIC, have some kind of implicit backing and separating them out and making it clear that they don't have any kind of implicit backing. They are just going to be allowed to fail. But I don't understand how that squares with your position that you retain, that the Fed retain emergency authority. Why wouldn't they still then in emergency situations continue, now that the precedent has been set, to use that emergency authority rather than whatever implicit authority?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","That is a legitimate question. Do you want to take the emergency authority away from the Federal Reserve and give it to nobody? I am not quite that radical at this point, given what we have been through. But it is a reasonable question. You are quite right, what I am trying to do is diminish the sense that it is there and available for nonbanks. Now on the international side, if what you say is true, I deal a little bit with it in my long statement I have issued to the committee. And there are some issues where international cooperation will be clearly necessary and, in fact, it has a pretty good history so far and that is in the area of capital requirements. There already is a high degree of uniformity in capital requirements. They are going to have to be reviewed, they are being reviewed nationally, they are being reviewed here and they are being reviewed in the U.K., but there is a body at the BIS, separate from the BIS, but a joint body of regulatory authorities to consider that issue. And they also have now extended their authority, encouraged by heads of state, to consider other matters of banking supervision and regulation where international consistency is important. And there are quite a few of those areas, and they have done quite a lot in trying to regularize practice. It is a big challenge, but it is important. On some of these other things, it is equally important. I think you already have a framework where practically all big banks or big countries with relevant banking systems already have a safety net. That is different in detail but it is a common factor. Now we have to deal with how all of these countries deal with their nonbanks. And I think some consistency there is important. The other really big financial center, as you well know, is London. And these matters are under intense consideration by the regulatory authorities in London. And at the end of the day, I think it is important that there be some consistency between what we do here and what they do in the U.K., just as a start. And I think that is quite possible. It won't be perfect, but that is the way we started actually with capital requirements. We got an agreement between the U.K. and the United States, and then it got extended around the world. So maybe we can duplicate that.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Now I am going to try again. The gentleman from Delaware.",Speech, 
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Volcker, like probably everybody else on this committee, I have a tremendous amount of respect for your comments on the economy and this particular problem of banking in general. I want to thank you for being here. I have some questions concerning the Federal Reserve itself. Let me throw a couple of things out and you can respond to them. As we all know, the Federal Reserve has great responsibilities in the economy today--you know that better than any of us--all the way from monetary policy to interest rates, the emergency powers that you have discussed here today, and consumer protection. The consumer protection may, in accord with whatever we do here in Congress, change and go over to be handled otherwise. But other than that, the remaining powers would be there. You have suggested strongly that it is the best agency. You have suggested in your writing--I am not sure if you spoke it or not--appointing someone else who would have this responsibility confirmed by the Senate, etc., with respect to the systemic risk, etc., and I understand that. But my question is, is the Federal Reserve taking on too much responsibility with respect to the monetary circumstances of this country and its policy, one, and then the second question is should there be or have you recommended someplace-- I haven't seen it--some sort of a council that would meet with whomever the appointment of the Federal Reserve person would be to help guide this? And I am thinking about the other banking regulators who seem to have a great deal of knowledge and input. Would they serve on some sort of group that would advise or would all that be informal, or would they be formally members? I would be interested in your comments about the Federal Reserve's ability to manage this kind of emergency at this point.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, obviously, a very relevant question, is the Federal Reserve proposing or are other people proposing as things exist? Does the Federal Reserve take on too much? I don't think so. These are big responsibilities. But as I see it, there is a close relationship between banking and financial supervision and monetary policy. I don't think monetary policy should be a matter of domain of a few economists sitting in a room deciding on the basis of various theories which are probably controversial, and what interest rates should be precisely where, and so forth. That is part of it. But I think that process ought to be leavened by knowledge and close contact with what is going on in financial markets. Now, we have an example of that recently. The Federal Reserve was counting on monetary policy, but that got thrown off course and the economy got thrown off course completely by what was happening in the financial system outside the realm of monetary policy. Now, I think the regulators should have been on top of that a little better, although they are never going to be perfect. But we want to--I think we need a cross kind of fertilization between monetary policy and supervisory policy, myself. It is an old concern--go back and you read the history of the Federal Reserve. Marriner Eccles in the 1930's, who was then the Chairman, complained bitterly about the fact that the Federal Reserve didn't have enough control over supervisory policy because in the middle of the Depression, he thought those other banking supervisors were being way too tough on banks and inhibiting bank lending. And he thought they were too easy earlier, when the economy was doing well. Now, is the Federal Reserve going to do a better job? I don't know. I don't think they should be the only regulator. But I do think they are the logical ones to have this oversight responsibility. And I also think, as you mentioned, if the Federal Reserve is going to remain in the regulatory supervisory business, I think the Congress should reinforce their responsibility by doing such things as having a particular Vice Chairman of the Board who is responsible for supervisory policy, and he knows that is his statutory function. There is nobody in that position now. The staff is going to have to be strengthened and enlarged and various other measures made. Now, should there be a council? I have no problem with a council, and I think it would be useful, so long as there is somebody who is driving the process and is, in the end, responsible. And the Treasury, as I read it, they don't quite say it this way, but I think what it amounts to, at the end of the day, the way the Treasury would do it is have the Treasury in that position. And I guess the way I would do it is I would have the Federal Reserve in that position, because I think it is a part of a natural central banking function. It is interesting, this is in controversy all over the world, frankly, but in the U.K., which has gotten a lot of attention, supervisory authority was taken away from the Bank of England 10 years ago, more or less. And then when the crisis arose, they were kind of at sixes and sevens as to who was responsible and how the crisis arose; how did the regulatory agency--how was that too insensitive and why didn't the Bank of England know what was going on? And they had trouble coordinating the effort. And the Treasury got involved, too, as it naturally would, but at one point that was considered best practice: Take the regulation out of the Federal Reserve. I don't think that is a strong opinion internationally anymore, after seeing the primary exponent, the U.K.--I can't say it fell on its face, but it didn't do very well when push came to shove, because the locus of responsibility was not clear.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Mr. Volcker, thank you. There is a lot of interest, so we are going to have to move on. The gentleman from New York, Mr. Meeks.",Speech, 
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good to see you Mr. Volcker. We have been debating something within my office. I am going to make a quick statement and then just ask you if, in fact, you can give me your opinion on it; that we when we consider the issue of ``too-big-to-fail'' and moral hazard, we are basically trying to get firms and their investors to internalize the cost of negative externalities that they may present to the system as a whole. In other words, we want the capital costs and the capital structure and the appetite for the risk to reflect all the costs of the institution, both internally and externally. And I think Larry Summers, when he was speaking before this committee earlier, said that if a firm is too big to resolve in an orderly manner, it is undoubtedly too big to run in a professional manner. In other words, if the senior management of a financial institution cannot present a plan that will convince the public and its regulators that it can disentangle and wind down its operations in an orderly manner, there is no reason to believe that this same management team can run the institution on a daily basis, because they themselves don't fully understand their own company. And for this reason, I believe that a properly structured, comprehensive resolution authority is, in fact, the most critical pillar to managing the moral hazard of the ``too-big- to-fail'' and systemic risk going forward. And the reason for that is different than what has been commonly discussed. It seems to me that the strength of the resolution authority is that it makes debt capital markets work in concert with regulators, and debt presents multiples of equity on financial institutions' balance sheet and debt holders have the power of covenants to manage what they perceive as risk or threats to their privileges as debt holders. With effective, credible resolution authority, bondholders will know that they can no longer rely on the government as an informal insurance policy on their debt. It is this expectation in the past that has allowed firms to become ``too-big-to- fail'' as debt markets and every incentive to provide nearly unlimited financing to the largest institutions, knowing that the larger it got, the more likely it was that the investment would be backed by the government in case of institution failure. So I think that is the crucial area we are looking at, and I would like just to get an idea of what you think in that regard, because I think that is absolutely key as we move forward with reform, with regulation reform in this particular instance. I would love to get your opinion on that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I agree with the thrust of what you are saying. That is the burden of my testimony here this morning is that we do need such a resolution authority, for the reasons you described. Some of the approaches that the Administration has surrounded that with, I don't agree with. But the basic idea that you need that kind of authority is, I think, central.",Speech, 
"Mr. Meeks","Do you believe that, as a consequence of capital more accurately reflecting the full risk of investing in an institution, that it will increase with that the institution size and the level of global risk?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I hope we can get a realization of that; that the institution will be more careful and less risk-prone and less--and the financial system and the economy will be less subject to their failure.",Speech, 
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you. I yield back.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New York, Mr. Lee, I believe, would be next.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lee","Thank you, Mr. Volcker. It is a pleasure to have been listening to you this morning. I appreciate many of your thoughts. You touched on a lot of areas and I, like you in many cases, feel that you have to be very careful in how much farther we go along with expanding the Federal regulation. I think we need to have the right type of regulation in place with the right type of authority to those--in this case, the Federal Reserve. In many cases, I agreed with what you said. You touched briefly on the issue when you have banking institutions getting in more riskier-type trades. And in your mind, how do you--is there a way to decouple that and ensure we provide solvency to this industry?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Couple that with--",Speech, 
"Mr. Lee","With the banking institutions right now. How do we decouple where they are getting into riskier trading type activities--do you have a solution on how we would be able to separate these in a logical manner?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I think some of the activities that I am concerned about are clearly enough defined so you can just, in effect, either put it in law or have clear that the supervisory authority will prohibit it. The tricky area is I think trading, which we discussed a little bit earlier, because there is a kind of legitimate area of trading that a large bank anyway is going to engage in that is, in fact, considerably in the area of customer service. If a customer comes in and wants to sell some securities, they ought to be able to sell through a bank. And if a bank is going to handle that, it is going to have to have some kind of a trading operation, a foreign exchange operation. But I think there is a--the borderline is fuzzy, but there is a clear distinction between customer-related trading activity and pure proprietary trading, which some of the big institutions label it that way. They have a proprietary trading desk, separately operated, sitting someplace else, as in the case of--",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Mr. Volcker, could you speak into the microphone? You have to sacrifice politeness for audibility. So we need you to speak directly into the microphone. It is less important to be polite than to be audible, so don't look at who you are talking to.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","AIG is a good example of what I am worried about. It is not a bank, but it should be regulated, I think, naturally. But they had this trading operation, a little trading operation that made a lot of money for a while, and it got out of hand, mostly credit default swaps. Nobody was much looking at it. No regulator was looking at it. It is an activity that if, better informed now, if a supervisor was looking at it and AIG was supervised--and they should be supervised--somebody should have raised a question. That is an activity that had nothing to do with your insurance business directly, or out there on a trading operation to make a lot of money, and similarly to profit-making but not to the insurance business. Stop it. I mean, that was a clear enough case that you--",Speech, 
"Mr. Lee","I am just bringing up AIG. With the knowledge that you have now, in retrospect, going back a year ago, how would you have handled this situation with AIG?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","It is a complicated situation. They had to make a very quick decision about an area that nobody could understand the full implications of. The regulators I am sure were not on top of this operation in London or Connecticut, or wherever it was being operated. And everybody got in over their heads, and they did what was necessary in a very disturbed situation to provide money. And it has become now, as you know, $150 billion, $180 billion, whatever it is; it is, you know, outrageous. But I understand how they got there. That is what we want to avoid. And I might say, while it is not on the agenda today, and the Treasury didn't put it on the agenda, I would hope this committee would look at the question of national charters for insurance companies and bring them under--at least the big ones--under a framework so that something like AIG with similar problems can't arise in the future. I think a lot of the big insurance companies would welcome a national charter and the consistency that would provide, because--I don't want to commit them into the safety net, but I do think that they ought to be regulated in a consistent way.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lee","Thank you.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Thank you, Mr. Volcker. Let me just say, for your information, the question of an optional Federal charter for the insurance, particularly life insurance, is on the committee's agenda for probably next year. It just would be more weight than I think this issue could carry. There will be a proposal made by some for a national insurance office to do some monitoring. But the question of an optional charter is a very important one. It is a request we get from the international community. There is a lot of resistance to it at the State Insurance Commission level here. But I did want to assure you--",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I know there is something short of a charter. I hope you would go further than what has been proposed.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Well, right now--that, right now, is much short of a charter. For next year, on this committee's agenda next year, will be the question of a charter, of an optional charter. The gentlewoman from Illinois, for instance, has been very much interested in that, along with the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce. And I have assured them they will get a full hearing. But it just, with the agenda this year, complicated by needing to deal with the issues from last year--but it is on the agenda.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I am unaware of any other AIGs out there, so maybe you are all right at the moment.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Well, of course, AIG's regulator was the fearsome Office of Thrift Supervision, and we will be addressing that issue. The gentleman from Kansas. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Chairman Frank, I ask unanimous consent that the resolution authority proposal by Tom Hoenig, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, and his colleagues, as well as two of his recent speeches, be entered into the record.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Without objection, it is so ordered. And, without objection, there will be general leave for any of the members or the witnesses to introduce into the record any material they would wish to insert. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Volcker, how do we end ``too-big-to-fail?'' I don't know if you have seen the recent proposal offered by Kansas City Fed President Hoenig and his colleagues. Their proposal on resolution authority lays out more explicit rules than the Administration's proposal of how a large financial institution Like Lehman Brothers or AIG could be resolved so the debt holders, shareholders, and management would be held accountable before taxpayers are asked to step in. If you haven't seen the Kansas City Fed proposal, I would like to provide to you a copy and I would appreciate your written comments, if you would please. Others suggest that we require the largest financial firms to undergo a regular stress test that would have aggregate information publicly released, even in good times. I know some have argued the list of these firms should remain confidential. But doesn't the market already know who these firms are, based on the last round of stress tests? How do you propose we create the right incentives for firms to maintain reasonable leverage ratios and strongly discourage ``too-big-to-fail?''",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I might say I become aware yesterday that a Kansas City bank had made such a proposal, but I haven't read it so I can't comment on it in detail. Mr. Moore of Kansas. I will forward this to you, sir.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I am sure these are all directed toward the same problem that we have been discussing; in fact, all these questions this morning. How do you reduce the moral hazard problem? How do you-- Mr. Moore of Kansas. Sir, excuse me. Could you pull the microphone just a little closer? I am having a little difficulty hearing you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I said, we have discussed in a number of these questions, and my opening statement, how we deal with this moral hazard problem. And in all these cases, I think, I believe in the Kansas City proposal, this idea of a resolution authority looms very large. Just how you do that, you are going to find not the easiest drafting problem in the world, because it raises a lot of technical issues and legal issues, even constitutional issues, which have to be carefully thought through. But I do think it is possible. There is clear precedent or clear analogous arrangements for the banking world. And so what needs to be done is extending that to the nonbanking world, without the implicit promise--and of course this is key--without the implicit assumption that Federal money will be provided in the case of the failing institution. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Chairman Volcker, as we consider monitoring for systemic risks, it seems to me that it would be helpful to ensure our inspectors general, the various financial agencies be also asked to help identify weaknesses in the regulatory structure and propose solutions. Would you support formally connecting these IGs to create a financial watchdog council, where they would meet on a quarterly basis and be required to provide Congress an annual high-risk assessment report on the greatest risks and gaps in our financial regulatory system that need to be addressed? Would you support a proposal like that, sir?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think I would have to look at that before I have any comment. When I respond on the Kansas City thing, I will respond on that point. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir, very, very much. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from West Virginia, Mrs. Capito.",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think I am out of sync here. Sorry.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Yes. Well, I take--",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","Well, I am in sync.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Well, on this issue I take instructions from the Minority, so Mr. Lance is next.",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you, sir.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lance","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you, Mr. Volcker. Regarding the whole issue of ``too-big-to-fail''--and this is obviously of great concern to all of us--and regarding the issue of moral hazard, yesterday the Secretary of the Treasury indicated that in identifying tier one candidates, there would not be a list but the market would know who they were, based upon the criteria. Is there any real way to resolve this situation? It seems to me that Wall Street will know who they are and that there will inevitably be moral risk, more hazard, as a result of the identification of tier one entities.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I don't think--Put it positive. I think it is extremely difficult to designate in advance who is systemically important and who isn't, because you may even find some fairly small institutions, not mega-institutions anyway, that are playing a particular role in the market at a particular time and have had a lot of interconnections with other institutions that create a big problem. They create a clog in the resolution of credit default swaps or something. Arranging all this in advance, I don't know whether the Treasury would intend to announce it or not announce it or set out criteria or what.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lance","Not as I understand it, sir. There would not be an announcement as to which entities actually are on the list, and the list would not be public; but that based upon the criteria, that Wall Street could figure out who they are.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, well, I would think that is true. Wall Street would figure it out, so you would have to probably announce it in the end. And then you have the problem, is a particular institution in, or is a particular institution out? And I think we will find in calm circumstances, the institutions that are in would hate it, because they would have particularly tough capital requirements and feel uncompetitive. But as soon as a problem arose, the institutions who were out would complain that we are vulnerable and they are not.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lance","Yes. I perceive a situation where, at one stage in the economic cycle, people would lobby not to be in it, and then later they would lobby to be in it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think it is not the happiest thing in the world, but I think you properly have to leave some ambiguity in this situation.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lance","Thank you, sir. This is a continuing issue on this committee, on both sides of the aisle, and it is not easily resolved. And I appreciate your thoughts on that. I yield back the balance of my time. Thank you.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from New York. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And it is good to see you again. I guess my line of questioning is, being that we are seeing, you know, the banks starting to come back and starting to loan--not as much as what they should--we are seeing the market coming back up a little bit. We see on TV that the banks and the financial institutions are spending millions of dollars with very nice fluffy ads to get customers to come back. And I guess the question is: With all that we are going to be trying to do, how long is it going to be before they start taking more risk again? And that is one of the concerns I have. You know, it used to be that all these corporations, they ran their business because of trust, trust of the American people. They have ruined that trust. We can stand here and sit here and try and make it better, but millions of people have lost their IRAs, they have lost their retirement funds. Many have had to stop their thoughts of even retiring. We can't make that up. But one of the things that I am afraid of, and I am already starting to see it, is the financial system is prone to more systemic risks today than I think ever before. I think it would be a tribute to the creation of complex investments products such as credit defaults. I mean, they are already starting on coming out with new products. And yet, you know, I think everybody was sleeping at the wheel. You talk about the Federal Reserve. No one did anything to really bring the attention to the authorities on the way they were supposed to. So how do we make that better? How do we get the industry, I guess, to have a moral backbone? That is the main point, and we can't legislate for that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I agree with your concerns, and we have lost the sense of fiduciary responsibility that should inherently--",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Into the microphone, please, Mr. Volcker.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I am going to have to eat it.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Bring it closer to you. It will move, you don't have to bend. Move the whole thing closer to you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I have a lot of sympathy with what the Representative from New York is saying about the loss of a sense of fiduciary responsibility. And I would like to restore that to the banks as much as possible, because they should have it. I think it is kind of hopeless in terms of--just in personal capital market operators. A tremendous amount of money, as you well know, was made in the financial system. So the incentive to get back to the situation as normal, or what was considered normal before, is pretty strong by the people who were participating. But, of course, it is that system that led us over the cliff, and with all the adverse consequences that were mentioned. And that is what we want to avoid in the future. And you talk about the capacity to make up more and more new products, get around more and more regulation. It occurs to me, as I heard you speaking, that maybe the best reform we could make is have a big tax on financial engineers so that they can't make up all these new things quite so rapidly; because it is this highly complex, opaque financial engineering which gave a false sense of confidence, which broke down. But you have outlined the challenge, and Treasury has tried to address it. The Administration has tried to address it. Many other people have made suggestions. I am making a few suggestions this morning. And you are going to have to decide. But you can't let it go without some important action. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. No, I agree with you. And I think important action is certainly where we are trying to go. And we are trying to find the right balance. Again, you know, we have a younger generation that we have been trying to convince that they should start saving. Saving in this Nation was at a zero rate before all this started.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","That is part of how we got in this problem. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Exactly. And with that being said, though, always try to look for something good. People are cutting back on some of their extraordinary expenses. They are cutting back on using their credit cards. And I think it is a lesson that everybody has made. But with that lesson, I think the punishment was too much. And I hope that we do find the right balance, especially for the consumers. We have to start taking care of the consumers this time around. Thank you.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Kansas.",Speech, 
"Ms. Jenkins","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, the Administration has said that one of the goals of its resolution authority is to inflict the cost of failure upon shareholders and bondholders. At the same time, Mr. Geithner has been unable to say that further bailouts of creditors will be off the table. In a world where the mantra has become ``no more Lehmans,'' is the promise that haircuts will be inflicted upon creditors the least bit credible? And if it is not credible, doesn't that mean that the next crisis will be still bigger?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","The danger is that the spread of implicitly a moral hazard could make the next crisis bigger. It is not going to be next year. It is not going to be probably 4 or 5 years. But memories are dim. And we want to make a system such that we don't have a still bigger crisis 10 years from now. And if we do nothing and let moral hazard become even more accepted, I am afraid there is a real danger. So you want this resolution system to do such things as creditors taking a haircut if they have to; or convert into stocks, and the stockholder will probably lose and lose completely. In many cases, there will be a forced merger or other actions that will not require the injection of government money that can stabilize the situation. Now, that is more forceful than what happened in the midst of the great crisis a year ago when, by and large, with the exception of Lehman, the bondholders were pretty much protected in the financial world. They weren't protected in General Motors and Chrysler, but they were protected in the financial. And even some of the stockholders were protected. Now, they did not lose as much as you might have thought they should have lost. We want to minimize that kind of result to the extent possible so that the lesson gets through: You creditors are taking a risk and you ought to understand that. And the government isn't going to come to your aid if this institution fails. And this is the game. I hate to call it a game, but this is, I think, the approach that we are trying to instill, and make sure there is what is appropriate uncertainty, or maybe certainty, that if these nonbank institutions are going to fail, the creditors are at risk and the stockholders are at risk. And we do the best we can to do that without destroying the system.",Speech, 
"Ms. Jenkins","Thank you. I appreciate your input. I yield back the balance of my time.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Massachusetts. This time, I saw you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Lynch","Mr. Volcker, thank you for your attendance and for helping the committee with its work. I was listening to your testimony outside and I was wondering, this whole framework that we are considering here--given the complexity of some of this, some of the instruments that are being traded now, the derivatives that we are now going to put on exchanges, and some that are not but necessarily require oversight, where we are entering new territory here which we hope will bring more effective regulation to the entire financial services industry. The question for us in part will be how to pay for that, how to pay for that structure. And I know that the last time we had a great disruption here, the Great Depression, Congress and the financial services industry sat down and they derived a system that--I think it was one three-hundreth of 1 percent of every share traded on the exchanges would go in to pay for the SEC, for example. That number has been reduced over time because of the volume of trades. But would you favor some type of--when we have to grapple with how to pay for all this, would you favor some type of system, some transaction fee, for example, that would help fund all of this? We have many, many of our constituents who don't have any--they don't have an IRA, they don't have money in the stock market. And yet if we use the general taxation authority, they too will be paying for this system that they don't necessarily benefit directly from. And I was wondering if we could have your thoughts on how we might as a Congress pay for some of the regulation that we are about to implement.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, just a general question has arisen from time to time in the past. It rose quite poignantly 20 or 30 years ago with respect to foreign exchange crises or foreign exchange operations, as to whether a little tax wouldn't do some good, both in raising revenues and in discouraging speculative activity. I think the conclusion of people who looked into that in the past was kind of twofold. First of all, it is very hard to do it for one country in any significant amount, because you force then, competitively, the market to another country that doesn't charge. So that is the number one problem. You have to get some consistency internationally. The more general problem, I think, is if the fee is low enough not to be disruptive of markets, it is not going to raise much revenue. If it is high enough to raise some revenue, it will be disruptive. So you are kind of caught; and is there any middle ground? But I think it might be interesting if the Congress suggested somebody look at this and see whether there is anything to the idea at all. You probably are aware that the head of the British Supervisory Authority has proposed--and I think he says he doesn't think it is going to happen--but he says just what you say: Maybe a little tax on the financial transactions would be a good thing. It is very interesting. He says maybe the financial world, financial system, got too big in the U.K., it got too dominant. It made a lot of money, but it really didn't contribute to the national wealth of the United Kingdom. And he has raised some very interesting questions, including, I don't know how seriously, the question of this tax. But he has a point. You are probably familiar with the fact that the world of finance at one point, in terms of its total profits, came to almost 40 percent of all the profits in the United States. And that doesn't even count all the bonuses. That is after the bonuses. And you know, some people raised the question, I raised a question of whether the value, really, of the world of finance is 40 percent of the United States and things haven't gotten a little out of bounds here, which is what you are struggling with in a general sense. How is this great industry of finance, harnessed to do the job it is going to do, an absolutely indispensable job, without taking risks that for a while were very profitable, and then it turned very sour. How do you get the job done, done in a way that--of course, smart men can make reasonable returns without placing the whole economy at risk.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The time has expired. Mr. Volcker can stay until 11:30. There are 10 members present who haven't asked questions. I will announce on the Democratic side that I will give priority to the people who were here. That should accommodate everybody who was here. If no new members come on either side, everybody who sat through it can do it. The Minority can make its decisions. But with Mr. Volcker's agreement, that will give us 10 people an hour. We will hold people strictly to 5 minutes. And in fairness to the people who were here, that is the way we will go. So now it is up to Mrs. Capito.",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for being here. I would like to go to the resolution authority that the Administration has proposed. Those of us--we put together a Republican plan to deal with re-regulation and new regulation. And one of the ideas that we put forward was an enhanced bankruptcy rather than a resolution authority by the Reserve. And I think in doing that, I think we were--we feel that it creates more transparency, accountability; it can go into the bankruptcy court, with the accompanying experts in that bankruptcy court that would understand the complexity of what is going on. And also, it would remove, I think, any kind of appearance of a bailout or another implicit or implied government backstop. Do you have an opinion on an enhanced bankruptcy as opposed to the resolution before you?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I haven't seen your proposal so I can't comment in detail. But I think the problem that we are all dealing with is when the emergency comes, you don't have much time. And it looks efficient anyway, to say okay, the government had to take action immediately. We are going to put somebody in there to run this organization, and it can do what it can do in terms of, for instance, doing the kind of thing with the creditors that a bankruptcy court might eventually do. But you don't have a month to work it out. You don't have 2 months to work it out. You don't have a week to work it out. You don't have days to work it out. You have to do it right away, or at least plan it right away. So that is, I think, the problem that we are dealing with, the ordinary bankruptcy-type negotiated settlements which work okay when you don't have a systemic risk. That is a day-by-day affair. You have to deal with it immediately. And that is, of course, the problem we ran into a year ago. So within that constraint, if you have a better way of doing it, good; but I think it has to recognize that constraint.",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","All right, thank you. My last question is, so many of these matters--I mean you have dealt with these matters your entire life and done such a wonderful job. They are so darn complicated for the man on the street who is listening to this hearing. Or any time I go to my district and try to talk about the need for new regulation in the financial markets, people's eyes start to glass over. And I know you have made many speeches and many--is there any way, in a concise way, besides, you know, this is going to protect you from losing your retirement in the future--is there any way that you find is most effective to convey the message to the man on the street that this is an issue that really does impact them every day in their life?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, it would be no comfort to you that I find it too damn complicated myself, so it is very complicated. But I think the message that you have to give them is, the whole object of this exercise is to prevent a repeat of what has happened. And it is not just a loss of finance, which is obviously important, particularly the loss of retirement funds and all that kind of thing. That is serious enough. But it has also affected the operation of the economy. So people lost jobs, and we are left with a big recession, we are left with a situation where it is going to be a tough recovery. So we are dealing with a big problem--you are dealing with. And I wish it was simpler, but it is not very simple because the finance system itself has gotten so complicated. I think that is part of the problem, frankly. I mean, I think I have made remarks about financial engineers. I am more than half serious about that, because it has gotten so complicated. I am sure the management of most financial institutions don't understand what people are doing down in the bowels of the institution, in some very fancy bit of financial engineering. And they get told, as I am sure in the case of the subprime mortgage, we have it all figured out. These are lousy mortgages but we have them all put together in a way that is perfectly safe and they are triple A. So you can buy them and you can pay. And I don't think the managements in most cases, you know, were able to see through that, understandably, because it is very complicated. Now I think the cloud before the eyes has been removed, and we ought to take advantage of that and try to make sure it doesn't return.",Speech, 
"Mrs. Capito","Thank you. I yield back.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Miller. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Volcker. Last fall when Lehman collapsed and AIG was rescued, I felt like I was not a sufficiently conscientious member of this committee, because I so little understood credit default swaps which had played such a huge role in all that. And then I came to realize that no one understood them, which made me feel a little better about my own level of conscientiousness, but maybe feel worse for the economy of the country and of the world. In your testimony, you identified credit default swaps as something that had exacerbated the risks that our entire economy faced, the Nation's economy and the world's economy. The usual justification is risk management. They are like insurance. But the great, great bulk of credit default swaps and other derivatives are between parties, none of whom have any risk to manage. They have no interest in the underlying whatever it is. You, in your testimony, said some kinds of risky behavior should not be allowed of institutions that are systemically important. Do you think credit default swaps, for instance, where nobody in the contract has any interest in the underlying security, should be allowed of systemically important institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, let me just make a general kind of philosophic question, and then credit default swaps. My general position is you make a distinction between banks and others. Banks are going to be protected. They are protected in other countries. They have been protected here for a century. That is not going to change, shouldn't change, I don't think. But let's not extend that protection to the whole world. Now we get the credit default swaps which are out there in the market and arguably serve a legitimate function in a trading operation of protecting the holding of a bond against the default on the bond. But it became a big kind of speculative market, trading market, so you had many more credit default swaps outstanding than there were credits, which raises some questions about the functioning of the market, and how the basic purpose it was serving was underlying and had a purpose. But the market was developed in a way that it was vulnerable to collapse--if that is the right word--if it came under great strain. And it came under great strain because AIG was so central to the market. Now, that had been of concern, frankly, before. Some people understood this before the crisis, and, on a voluntary basis, began introducing measures-- Mr. Miller of North Carolina. You do need to eat your microphone. I am having a really hard time hearing you. Sorry.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I said people had begun working on the credit default swap problem in terms of the clearance and settlement procedures, even before the crisis, on a voluntary basis, with some success and some great effort. Now the crisis has exposed it and the government stepped in and made proposals. I don't know how many of them require legislation. At some point, it will require some legislation. But now there is a lot of progress in forcing this trading into clearinghouses or organized exchanges with the whole panoply of rules that implies, collateral requirements, protection against default and so forth. So that is a big step forward. You might not have had the AIG problem which has loomed so large, had all those arrangements been in place before, because there were no agreed--well, there was an appropriate basis in that respect, some agreed conventions, but AIG did not sufficiently collateralize and protect against risk, given what happened. They thought they had no risk because they were so big and strong. Well, when they weren't so big and strong, you had a problem. That is a big problem, and it is one of the areas in which I am sure that big progress is going to be made and is being made. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Do you think that the margin requirements to the collateral requirement is sufficient with respect to--",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, somebody ought to be in a position to make sure that it is sufficient. I am not an expert. I can't judge whether they are sufficient or insufficient. Somebody ought to be deciding that. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Are there any collateral default swaps, credit default swaps, other derivatives, that should require an insurable interest by somebody in the transaction? Should there be a requirement with respect to any credit default swaps of an insurable interest?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think this whole market needs to be brought under surveillance, and you ought to provide the authority that somebody can have adequate authority to satisfy themselves the market is sanitized. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. My time has expired. Thank you.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Texas.",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Volcker, for being here. Looking back at your experience at the Federal Reserve, one of the things that is out there today is that the Federal Reserve would designate these tier one companies in financial institutions. And a lot of people believe that when you say that company is tier one, that they are in fact ``too-big-to- fail.'' And so there is an implicit guarantee there that these are entities that we are not going to let fail. The question I have for you is: Is that good for the marketplace, and is that good policy?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","No, I don't like that idea. That is part of what I am saying here. Trying to identify these institutions in advance as a special interest, whether they say it or not, then carries the connotation in the market that they are ``too-big- to-fail.'' And I think that adds to the moral hazard problem. Most of what we have been discussing this morning is how to corral moral hazard. And I don't think that is--that is not the way to do it. It doesn't corral it, it extends it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","I have heard you say--and I think this is something that you and I agree on--that capital could have cured a lot of the ills that we faced in the country over the last year if these companies had actually been capitalized to a level sufficient and commensurate with the risks and exposure that they were taking. Is it a better strategy, in your opinion, for the regulatory agencies, the regulators, that when these entities are very diverse, involved in a lot of different activities, that they actually do a better job of breaking down the businesses that each one of these entities is in, and assigning capital requirements for those activities; and so then, if that entity wants to continue that business activity, it understands that it will have to have a certain amount of capital to do that, and the marketplace then, in effect, begins to analyze those businesses and ascertain whether they want to furnish the capital to those institutions? And so don't you have a check and balance from the marketplace as well as the regulatory structure?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think capital requirements and amount of capital are obviously important. But if you try to fine-tune it too far--the banking regulators have struggled with this--how much capital in each particular kind of risk basket? It is very hard to define different risks very precisely. And they went from a system, or trying to go from a system that was very crude, back when I was Chairman of the Federal Reserve--which we had installed--to say it is not sophisticated enough, it doesn't have all those baskets that you are talking about. But boy, they have run into more difficulty. They have spent 10 years trying to define this and they put a lot of weight on credit rating agencies. Now, that no longer looks so great. But that is illustrative of the kind of problem you run into. So I am kind of on the side of, yes, adequate capital. Yes, make sure capital is big enough, but recognize it has to be pretty crude, and don't try to be too sophisticated about it. I do think, and you may be getting at this, when you get into nonbanks, bank capital is already--whether it is adequate or not, no doubt it is a matter of a supervisory concern. When you get outside of the banking system, then I think there ought to be some residual authority for those few institutions that get so big they really look dangerous from the standpoint of financial stability, somebody has the authority to say, look, you are too leveraged. You have to provide some more capital, or you have to cut down on your assets; or you cut down on your activities and you have to hold more liquidity. I think the need for that will be rare. I do believe in registration of hedge funds, I do believe there ought to be some reporting of hedge funds. But I think there are very few hedge funds that present a systemic risk. They are a different kind of operation, a different kind of financing. We have seen failures of hedge funds that were successfully absorbed without much difficulty. Interestingly enough, where that was not true was the hedge funds owned by Bear Stearns. What sent Bear Stearns in the beginning of its downward slide was the failure of or losses in its own hedge funds, which is illustrative of why I don't want commercial banks to be holding hedge funds, because that would be a point of vulnerability.",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"The Chairman","Thank you. We have votes, unfortunately. We can't hold Mr. Volcker after this. We will have time for two more questions for people who have been here, and then we will break. We will resume, and we will start with those who were here and didn't get to ask. The gentleman from Georgia.",Speech, 
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Volcker, let me ask you to comment on the whole issue of ``too-big-to-fail,'' because I think that we have not paid attention to what happens as a result of that. The consequence becomes what do we do; do we have a strategy; does that strategy lead to another strategy called too-small-to-save? And I think that is where we are. Historically, if we looked at the Depression that we went through, it was these smaller banks, banks went under, they never came back. Eventually, smaller banks began to serve a niche. I am very concerned about the future of our smaller banks, our community and regional banks. And are we at the point, as a result of this rush to save these large banks, holding companies, there isn't that much attention that we are faced with in terms of these smaller banks. Bank after bank after bank has gone under across this country. They haven't been the Bank of Americas or the SunTrusts or the national banks, the big banks. They have been these community banks that actually provide the monies for these communities. One of the big problems we had, for example, with the automobile dealers was the fact that once the automobile manufacturers had a problem, the automobile dealers had a problem, but it wasn't--their problem was the inability to get money. So the problem here becomes, I think, we are glossing over a deeper problem here of getting down to the grass roots in these communities. Unemployment is not going to bounce back until we get these small businesses thriving. The small businesses are getting their monies from the smaller community regional banks. And yet because of this overemphasis on this ``too-big-to-fail'' strategy, we are losing the bigger picture, it seems to me; and as a result, we are left with too-little- to-save. Could you comment on this particular predicament we are in?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, I am not sure how helpful I can be. I think there is a problem. Obviously you are seeing a lot of failing of small banks, and they are kind of easy to take care of in terms of the capacity of the FDIC, and disturbance or lack thereof, and the failure of a particular small bank. But I do think that it takes judgment. But in a particular case of a small bank, to what extent is the problem one of accounting practice maybe, and I think bank accounting needs some review. I am not sure how important that is to these smaller banks. Are their cases where--bad word, but I will use it--that forbearance would have been justified, and the benefit of the doubt in some sense given to the small bank to see whether it can hold together for a while without forcing it into either a merger or liquidation? I don't know. That takes a very sophisticated and understanding regulatory regime, which may be beyond us.",Speech, 
"Mr. Scott","Do you see a future for the small community regional banks?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Look, I am old-fashioned. I see a future for small- and medium-sized community banks because they have some inherent advantages in dealing with local communities and the small borrowers and the individuals that are concerned. I think they can be quite competitive. And they are not a danger to the country. Quite the contrary. What I think we ought to do is we ought to be conscious that we are not unconsciously undercutting them. But I don't have any magic answers to that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Scott","All right. Well, thank you very much. Let me just ask you one other question here. I have a few more minutes. Over the past 6 months, loans and leases have declined at a record annual rate of 8 percent with no hint of an upturn, despite the Fed's massive effort to get credit flowing. Credit is still not flowing sufficiently to assure a strong and sustainable economy. Do you believe this to be a two-sided problem? One, reduced willingness of banks to lend amid the record loan delinquencies; and, two, the subdued desire to borrow.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, bank lending, I guess, is declining. This is an area of the market that is still clogged up. It is a matter of confidence in part, in large part. And a lot of them are in financial difficulty. And I think it is going to take time for that to unlock. The big market has opened up considerably, but the small bank market has not, although there are some signs it is beginning to change. So I hope that we can see evidence of that before too long.",Speech, 
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Volcker. Mr. Miller of North Carolina.  Thank you. Mr. Hensarling.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And, Chairman Volcker, over here. The good news is I appear to be your last questioner of the morning. Thank you for your time, sir. I want to follow up on a line of questioning from my colleague from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer, and try to put a very fine point on it, perhaps a theoretical point. He was inquiring about, in retrospect, could the regulators, had they had I suppose more perfect knowledge in being able to assess risk, could they not have applied the proper capital and liquidity standards, be it to our insured institutions or our investment banks? At least, theoretically, had they known, could you have applied proper capital and liquidity standards to perhaps have prevented the economic turmoil that we saw?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think the answer is, theoretically, yes. But the answer may also be, practically, no. I don't mean to be that negative. But the problem with banking supervision, the chronic problem is when things are going well, nobody wants to hear from the supervisor, including Congress, doesn't want to hear about restrictions. And you will get complaints from your constituencies: ``What are those big bad regulators doing demanding higher capital requirements and preventing me from doing this or that?'' ``I never failed,'' the argument will be, ``and I am doing fine. Leave me alone.'' And then, of course, when things happen, where were they?",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","But I guess for a historical perspective-- and I guess I would ask if you agree or disagree--at least with respect to our insured institutions, the prudential regulators had the ability to take prompt and correct action.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think there was some failure in banking supervision.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","Perhaps they lacked the expertise, perhaps they lacked the courage, forethought, but they didn't really didn't lack the regulatory authority to have imposed a capital or liquidity standard that would have been commensurate with the risk.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think there are two things in particular that I would say directed toward that. First of all, I do think that the idea of having an overall overseer to kind of look at things, whether capital standards generally are adequate, whether the liquidity standards are adequate, whether some trading operations are developing that are destabilizing. We haven't had anybody overtly and specifically charged with that kind of responsibility. We have individual agencies looking at individual banks, yes, and they are worried about capital. But they don't take a fully systemic view, by nature of their responsibilities. I also think, so far as the Federal Reserve specifically is concerned, if they are going to carry heavy supervisory responsibility, I think there does need to be some internal reorganization in the Federal Reserve to make sure that the Board itself, the Chairman and the Board itself, are sufficiently invested with the responsibility for regulation and supervision. And explicitly I have suggested, other people have suggested, that there be created a position of Vice Chairman of the Board for Regulatory and Supervisory Practice, so that there is no doubt on your part as a Congressman as to who in the Federal Reserve is supposed to be on top of that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","Chairman Volcker, let me turn to the question of resolution authority. And clearly, there are differences within this body on how best to do that, be that through some type of greater expert enhanced bankruptcy process versus perhaps the Federal Reserve undertaking this particular duty. I believe I heard Chairman Frank, yesterday, say that whatever the resolution authority--and I know he is not in the Chair at the moment--what I believe I heard he said, at least from his perspective, is that resolution authority essentially ought to be a death sentence, which I believe I interpreted to mean that he would favor receivership over conservatorship. We presently have Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and AIG in forms of conservatorship, with massive transfusions of taxpayer money, with no exit strategy, no end in sight for the taxpayer. Whatever resolution authority may come out of the United States Congress, could you speak to us about your opinion on whether or not it should have the ability to place these into conservatorship versus receivership and the pros and cons associated with that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think there ought to be authority for both. Conservatorship, implying this is an institution that has enough viability to be reorganized and be merged and revitalized; and receivership, liquidator.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","Would you put AIG in the category of a firm that--",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I am not the regulator of AIG. I don't have any knowledge of all of AIG. I know it is very, very complicated, complicated enough that I haven't wanted to get involved.",Speech, 
"Mr. Hensarling","We are out of time. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Thank you. Mr. Volcker, because time is of the essence, I am going to move rather quickly to my questions, and there are only two. The first has to do with the notion that, metaphorically speaking, this economy had a toothache. And many times when you have a toothache, you will do anything to get rid of it. But once you are rid of it, you don't have the same memory of the pain that you had at the time you had the toothache. And the reason I use this metaphor is because I want you to tell me just how bad it was. You spoke in terms of the economy going off a cliff. Tell me how bad was it when we interceded? How bad was it?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Bad. Very bad.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Compared to the Great Depression, let's call the Great Depression a 10. If it was a 10, how bad was this situation, Mr. Volcker?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Well, the disturbance was very large, but of course, extremely forceful action was taken to curb the deterioration. But as you know, for a couple of quarters, the economy went down very rapidly, and part of the problem was it was not only in the United States. It became a worldwide phenomenon, a worldwide--I shouldn't say worldwide. It became a phenomenon among almost all well-developed countries. So you had a situation that could feed upon itself, there was no strong point of growth in the world economy. So it was bad. It is impossible to tell what would have happened without the massive government support. But you knew at that point and even now, the financial system was based upon government support. And that is not the kind of financial system we want to have. It is not what we talk about as a free enterprise system.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","When you use the term ``going off a cliff,'' sir, give me a little bit more of what that means, ``going off a cliff.''",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","It meant that, the falling-off-the-cliff analogy applied to the rapid decline in the economic activity for 6 months or so, which found its expression, cause, the rapidity of it, in that the supply of credit dried up. Banks were not lending. Banks could not lend. The open market was constipated. So there was no availability of credit, and that led to, obviously, difficulties in carrying on economic activity.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","I am going to ask one final question, and because my friend and I have different views on this, I am going to stay and give him an opportunity, because he may want to have a follow-up on this question. I think it is only fair to do so. Mr. Volcker, was the CRA the cause of this crisis that you and I just finished discussing?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","What was the cause?",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Was the CRA, the Community Reinvestment Act, the cause?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Was the Community Reinvestment Act the cause?",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","I don't mean to insult your intelligence, but it is important that I get this on the record. Was the Community Reinvestment Act the cause?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","A cause?",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","The cause.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I don't believe that it was a significant factor in this situation.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Now, because we are short on time, sir, could you--",Speech, 
"Mr. Royce","I will be very brief. And, by the way, we go through a routine where we ask if the Government-Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, were one of the causes, the lack of regulation over them, and then that gets translated, but that is not what I am interested in today.",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I am willing to inject a comment here.",Speech, 
"Mr. Royce","Yes?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Please do not recreate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in the form of these hybrid institutions, half private, half public.",Speech, 
"Mr. Royce","So you think that the GSEs were one of the causes?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","I think they were a factor, yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Royce","Okay, then, let me ask you a question. The Richmond Fed economist, back in 1999, said 27 percent of all of the liabilities of firms in the U.S. financial sector were explicitly guaranteed by the Federal Government; another 18 percent enjoyed some implicit support. That would be 45 percent. Now that is back 10 years ago. Now we look at March of 2008 when the New York Fed stepped in and assumed the risk of about $30 billion in the portfolio of the investment bank Bear Stearns. So we have seen this rapid expansion of both the perceived and the actual financial safety net, the explicit financial safety net. Do you think the expansion of this safety net has exacerbated the ``too-big-to- fail'' problem?",Speech, 
"Mr. Volcker","Yes, and I think the whole--90 percent of the discussion we have been having here is trying to figure out some way of pulling that back.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","I am going to have to ask Mr. Volcker to give the rest of his response in writing. We have exceeded our time and are to zero on our voting--",Speech, 
"Mr. Royce","Sure enough.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","If I may say so, Mr. Volcker, we thank you for being here, and I do this on behalf of our Chair, and we thank all of the other panelists for being here.

"Mr. Cleaver","I think we will go ahead and begin with our testimony. We appreciate all of you donating your valuable time and intelligence to this committee today. We are going to begin with the Honorable Arthur Levitt, Jr., the former Chairman of the SEC and Senior Advisor to the Carlyle Group.",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","Thank you for the opportunity of appearing before the committee to discuss the critical issues of establishing a systemic risk regulator and a resolution authority. I will summarize my prepared statement, which I have submitted to the record. As a former Chair of the SEC and currently as an advisor to Getco, The Carlyle Group, and Goldman Sachs, I hope I can share with you important considerations to inform your efforts. Though the appetite for reform appears to move in inverse relationship to market performance, financial markets are no less risky and regulatory gaps remain. I am concerned that public investors may well be convinced because of the relative market calm of the last few months that all is well in our regulatory system, but all is not well and I am glad you are showing leadership in addressing these issues. Your success will be determined by how well you affirm the principles of effective financial regulations, principles relating to transparency and regulatory independence, the proper oversight of leverage and risk taking, the nurturing of strong enforcement, early intervention, and the imposition of market discipline. One of the key questions before this committee is how to authorize and hold accountable a systemic risk regulator and who should provide this function. I would like to suggest that the more critical question is whether any regulator or groups of regulators can have the same impact as well as a resolution authority. Such an authority would be created explicitly to impose discipline on those with the most power to influence the level of risk taking, the holders of both equity and debt in institutions which may be ``too-big-to-fail.'' A systemic risk regulator will not be effective unless you also create a resolution authority with the power to send these failing institutions to their demise and thus impact the holders of both their debt and equity. To give a simple analogy, it doesn't matter who serves as the cop on the beat if there are no courts of law to send law breakers to jail. I strongly believe that a systemic risk regulator must serve as an early warning system with the power to direct appropriate regulatory agencies to implement actions. I am agnostic about who should lead such an agency and perform this function, and I would caution against making the Federal Reserve the systemic risk regulator in its present structure. The Fed's responsibilities to defend the safety and soundness of financial institutions and to manage monetary policy creates inevitable and compromising conflicts with the kind of vigilance and independent oversight a systemic risk regulator requires. If, however, the Fed is deemed to be the best available place for this role, I would urge Congress to remove from the Fed some of its responsibilities, conflicting responsibilities, especially those of bank oversight. In many respects, the surest way to cause investors, lenders, and management to focus on risk is not to warn them about risk but to give them every conceivable way to discover risk and tell them what will happen to them if they don't pay attention. We can deal with this by establishing a resolution authority charged with closing out failed institutions which pose systemwide risk. Such an authority would have the power to do just about anything to put a failing bank in order or close it down in an orderly way without, if possible, further government assistance. It could terminate contracts, it could sell assets, cancel debt, cancel equity, and refer management for civil penalties for taking excessive risk even after multiple warnings. I would expect that managers, customers, creditors, and investors would become a good deal more careful, having foreknowledge of their potential rights and responsibilities should such a resolution authority be activated. They would see the advantage of greater transparency and developing more knowledge of individual institutions, and this market discovery may well do the work of many outside systemic risk regulators. Of course, your goal is to incentivise market discovery. You will also want to establish the value of transparency with respect to market information. I want to emphasize in particular the importance of fair value accounting for major financial institutions engaging in significant amounts of risk taking and leverage. Such accounting gives investors a true sense of the value of an asset in all market conditions, not just those conditions favored by asset holders. Greater transparency would make it possible for market participants to price risks appropriately and for a systemic risk regulator to demand fresh infusions of liquidity or higher margin requirements if needed. I would much prefer that a systemic risk regulator be so effective that a resolution authority would be unnecessary. But sadly, we know that always preventing failure is absolutely impossible. I think it is, therefore, in my opinion, your job to make failure possible. Thanks again for your attention to these issues, and I urge you to continue to accelerate your efforts.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ARTHUR LEVITT, JR., FORMER CHAIRMAN OF THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION; SENIOR ADVISOR, THE CARLYLE GROUP

"Mr. Miron","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Neugebauer, and committee members. Let me begin by expressing my thanks for the opportunity to present my views on this matter. The question I will address is whether Congress should adopt Title XII of the proposed Resolution Authority for Large Interconnected Financial Companies Act of 2009. This Act would grant the FDIC powers for resolving insolvent financial institutions similar to those that it currently possesses for revolving banks. My answer to this question is an emphatic, unequivocal ``no.'' Let me explain. The problem that resolution systems attempts to address is that when our financial system fails, the value of the claims on that institution's assets exceed the value of the assets themselves. Thus, someone must decide who gets what, and it is impossible, by virtue of the assumption that we are dealing with a failed institution, to make everyone whole. The size of the pie owned by the failing institution has shrunk so those who are expecting a slice of that pie collectively face the necessity of going somewhat or substantially hungry. The resolution authority decides who gets what, but the reality is that someone has to go wanting. It is in society's broad interest to have clear, simple, and enforceable procedures for resolving failed institutions, principally to ensure that investors are willing to commit their funds in the first place. If the rules about resolution were arbitrary and ever-changing, investors would be loathe to invest and economic investment productivity and growth would suffer. A well-functioning resolution process is part of a system for defining and enforcing property rights, which economists agree is essential to a smoothly functioning capital system. The crucial thing to remember here is that someone has to lose. Just as importantly, it is valuable to society as a whole, although not to the directly-harmed parties, that those invested in the failed institutions suffer economic losses. This releases resources to better uses, provides signals about good and bad investments and rewards those who have made smart decisions. The flip side of the fact that standard resolution systems, like bankruptcy, impose an institution's losses on that institution's stakeholders, is the fact that a standard of resolution authority, such as the courts, puts none of its own resources into that institution. The resolution authority is resolving claims and dividing the pie but is not adding any more pie. Under the bill being considered, however, the FDIC would have the power to make loans to the financial institutions to purchase its debt obligations and other assets, to assume or guarantee obligations and so on. This means the FDIC would be putting its own, that is, taxpayers' skin in the game, a radical departure from standard bankruptcy and an approach that mimics closely the actions that Treasury took under TARP. Thus, this bill institutionalizes TARP for bank holding companies. A crucial implication of this departure from standard bankruptcy is the taxpayer funds foot the bill for the loans, asset purchases, guarantees, and other support that FDIC would provide to prevent failing institutions from going under. These infusions of taxpayer funds come with little meaningful accountability, and it would be hard to know when they have been paid back and often that will not occur. The proposed new authority for the FDIC also generates the impression that society can avoid the losses that failure implies, but that is false. The proposed FDIC actions would merely shift those losses to taxpayers. The new approach is institutionalized bailouts, plain and simple. Thus, under the expansion of FDIC authority to cover nonbank financial institutions, bank holding companies will forever more regard themselves as explicitly, not just implicitly, backstopped by the full faith and credit of the U.S. Treasury. That is moral hazard in the extreme and it will be disastrous for keeping the lid on inappropriate risk taking. The right alternative to expanding FDIC authority is good old-fashioned bankruptcy. It has become accepted wisdom that bankruptcies by financial institutions cause great harm, and it is asserted in particular that letting Lehman Brothers fail was the crucial misstep last fall. In fact, nothing could be further from the truth. As I explain in more detail in my written testimony, the ultimate causes of the financial crisis were two misguided Federal policies; namely, the enormous subsidies and pressure provided for mortgage lending to non-creditworthy borrowers and the implicit guarantees provided by both Federal Reserve actions and the U.S. history of protecting financial institution creditors. These forces generated an enormous misallocation of investment capital, away from plant and equipment towards housing, created the bubble, and established a setting where numerous financial institutions had to fail because their assets were grossly overvalued relative to fundamentals. Lehman's failure was one part of this adjustment, and it was a necessary part. If anything, too few financial institutions failed since the massive interventions in credit housing markets that have occurred in the past year have artificially propped up housing prices, delaying the adjustments. Thus, the better way to resolve nonbank financial institutions is bankruptcy, not bailout. That is not to say existing bankruptcy law is perfect. One can imagine ways it might be faster and more transparent, which would be beneficial, nor should one assume that had bankruptcy been allowed to operate fully in the fall of 2008, the economy would have escaped without any pain. A significant economic downturn, in particular, was both inevitable and necessary given the fundamental misallocation of capital that occurred in the years before the panic, but nothing in the data, historical data or recent experience, suggests these bankruptcies would have caused anything worse than what we experienced and broader bankruptcies would have helped eliminate more hazards going forward. In light of these assessments, I urge the members of this committee to vote against this bill since it codifies an approach to the resolution that is fundamentally misguided. We need to learn from our mistakes and trust bankruptcies, not bailouts, going forward as we should have done in the recent past.",Statement,STATEMENT OF JEFFREY A. MIRON, SENIOR LECTURER AND DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES, DEPARTMENT OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
"Mr. Cleaver","Our next witness is Mr. Mark Zandi, the chief economist and co-founder of Moody's Economy.com.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","Thank you to the members of the committee for the opportunity to testify today. My remarks are my personal views and not those of the Moody's Corporation, my employer. The Obama Administration's proposed financial regulatory reforms will, if largely enacted, result in a more stable and well-functioning financial system. I will list five of the most important elements of the reform, and I will make a few suggestions on how to make them more effective. First, reform must establish a more orderly resolution process for large, systemically important financial firms. Regulators' uncertainty and delay in addressing the problems at Lehman Brothers and AIG, in my view, contributed significantly to the panic that hit the financial system last September. Financial institutions need a single, well-articulated, and transparent resolution mechanism outside the bankruptcy process. The new resolution mechanism should preserve the system of stability while encouraging market discipline by imposing losses on shareholders and other creditors and replacing senior management. Charging the FDIC with this responsibility is appropriate given the efficient job it does handling failed depository institutions. I think it would also be important to require that financial firms maintain an acceptable resolution plan to guide regulators in the event of their failure. As part of this plan, institutions should be required to conduct annual stress tests based on different economic scenarios similar to the tests that large banks engaged in this last spring. Such an exercise, I think, would be very therapeutic and would reveal how well institutions have prepared themselves for a badly-performing economy. Second, reform must address the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem, which has become even bigger in the financial crisis. The desire to break up large institutions is understandable, but I don't think there is any going back to the era of Glass- Steagall. Taxpayers are providing a substantial benefit to the shareholders and creditors of institutions considered ``too- big-to-fail,'' and these institutions should meet higher standards for safety and soundness. As financial firms grow larger, they should be subject to greater disclosure requirements, required to hold more capital, satisfy stiffer liquidity standards, and pay deposit and other insurance premiums commensurate with their size and the risks they pose. Capital buffers and insurance premiums should increase in the good times and decline in the bad times. Third, reform should make financial markets more transparent. Opaque structured-finance markets facilitated the origination of trillions of dollars in badly underwritten loans which ignited the panic when those loans and the securities they supported started to go bad. The key to better functioning financial markets is increased transparency. Requiring over-the-counter derivative trading takes place on central clearing platforms make sense; so does requiring that issuers of structured financed securities provide markets with the information necessary to evaluate the creditworthiness of the loans underlying the securities. Issuers of corporate equity and debt must provide extensive information to investors, but this is not the case for mortgage and asset-backed securities. Having an independent party also vet the data to ensure its accuracy and timeliness would also go a long way to ensure better lending and reestablishing confidence in these markets. Fourth, reform should establish the Federal Reserve as a systemic risk regulator. The Fed is uniquely suited for this task given its position in the global financial system, its significant financial and intellectual resources, and its history of political independence. The principal worry in making the Fed the systemic risk regulator is that its conduct of monetary policy may come under onerous oversight. Arguably one of the most important strengths of the financial system is the Fed's independence in setting monetary policy. It would be very counterproductive if regulatory reform were to diminish even the appearance of that independence. To this end it would be helpful if oversight of the Fed's regulatory functions were separated from the oversight of its monetary policy responsibilities. One suggestion would be to establish semi-annual reporting to the Congress on its regulatory activities much like its current reporting to Congress on monetary policy. Fifth, and finally, reform should establish a new Consumer Financial Protection Agency to protect consumers of financial products. The CFPA should have rulemaking, supervision, and enforcement authority. As is clear from the recent financial crisis, households have limited understanding of their obligations as borrowers or the risks they take as investors. It is also clear that the current fractured regulatory framework overseeing consumer financial protection is wholly inadequate. Much of the most egregious mortgage lending during the housing bubble earlier in the decade was done by financial firms whose corporate structures were designed specifically to fall between the regulatory cracks. There is no way to end the regulatory arbitrage in the regulatory framework. The framework itself must be fundamentally changed. The idea of a new agency has come under substantial criticism from financial institutions that fear it will stifle their ability to create new products and raise the cost of existing ones. This is not an unreasonable concern but it can be adequately addressed. The suggestion that the CFPA should require institutions to offer so-called plain vanilla financial products to households should be dropped. Such a requirement would create substantial disincentives for institutions to add useful features in existing products. Finally, let me just say I think the Administration's proposed regulatory reform is much-needed and reasonably well- designed. Reform will provide a framework that would not have prevented the last crisis, but it would have made it measurably less severe and it certainly will reduce the odds and severity of future calamities.",Statement,MARK ZANDI, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND CO-FOUNDER, MOODY'S ECONOMY.COM 
"Mr. Cleaver","Our final witness is John H. Cochrane, AQR capital management professor of finance at the University of Chicago Booth School of business.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","Thank you for giving me the opportunity to talk to you today. This wasn't an isolated event. We are in a cycle of ever- larger risk taking punctuated by ever-larger failures and ever- larger bailouts, and this cycle can't go on. We can't afford it. This crisis strained our government's borrowing ability, there remains the worry of flight from the dollar and government default through inflation. The next and larger crisis will lead to that calamity. Moreover, the bailout cycle is making the financial system much more fragile. Financial market participants expect what they have seen and what they have been told, that no large institution will be allowed to fail. They are reacting predictably. Banks are becoming bigger, more global, more integrated, more systemic, and more opaque. They want regulators to fear bankruptcy as much as possible. We need the exact opposite. We and Wall Street need to reconstruct the financial system so as much of it as possible can fail without government help, with pain to the interested parties but not to the system. There are two competing visions of policy to get to this goal. In the first, large integrated instructions will be allowed to continue and to grow with the implicit or explicit guarantee of government help in the event of trouble, But with the hope that more aggressive supervision will contain the obvious incentive to take more risks. In the second, we think carefully about the minimal set of activities that can't be allowed to fail and must be guaranteed. Then we commit not to bail out the rest. Private parties have to prepare for their failure. We name, we diagnose, and we fix whatever problems with bankruptcy law caused systemic fears. Clearly, I think the second approach is much more likely to work. The financial and legal engineering used to avoid regulation and capital controls last time were child's play. ``Too-big-to-fail'' must become ``too-big-to-exist.'' A resolution authority offers some advantages in this effort. It allows the government to impose some of the economic effects of failure, shareholders and debt holders lose money, without legal bankruptcy. But alas, nothing comes without a price. Regulators fear--their main systemic fear is often exactly the counterparties will lose money, so it is not obvious they will use this most important provision and instead bail out the counterparties. I think the FDIC, as often mentioned, is a useful model. It is useful for its limitations as well as for its rights. These constrain moral hazard and keep it from becoming a huge piggybank for Wall Street losses. The FDIC applies only to banks. Resolution authority must come with a similar statement of who is and who is not subject to its authority. Deposit insurance and FDIC resolution come with a serious restriction of activities. An FDIC-insured bank can't run a hedge fund. Protection, resolution, and government resources must similarly be limited to systemic activities and the minimum that has to accompany them. Deposit insurance in FDIC resolution address a clearly defined systemic problem, bank runs. A resolution authority must also be aimed at a specific defined and understood systemic problem, and the FDIC can only interfere with clear triggers. The Administration's proposal needs improvement, especially in the last two items. It only requires that the Secretary and the President announce their fear of serious adverse effects. That is an invitation to panic, frantic lobbying, and gamesmanship to make one's failure as costly as possible. It is useful to step back and ask, what problem is it we are trying to fix anyway? Regulators say they fear the systemic effects of bankruptcy. But what are these? If you ask exactly what is wrong with bankruptcy, you find fixable, technical problems. The runs on Lehman and Bear Stearns brokerages, collateral stuck in foreign bankruptcy courts, even the run on money market funds, these can all be fixed with changes to legal and accounting rules. And resolution doesn't avoid these questions. Somebody has to decide who gets what. If Citi is too complex for us to figure that out now, how is the poor Secretary of the Treasury going to figure it out at 2 o'clock in the morning on a Sunday night? The most pervasive argument for systemic effective bankruptcy, I think, is not technical; it is psychological. Markets expected the government to bail everybody out. Lehman's failure made them reconsider whether the government was going to bail out Citigroup. But the right answer to that problem is to limit and clearly define the presumption that everyone will be bailed out--not to expand it and leave it vague. Here I have to disagree with Mr. Volcker's testimony. He said we should always leave people guessing, but that means people will always be guessing what the government is going to do, leading to panic when it does something else. And let me applaud Chairman Frank's statement earlier that no one will believe us until we let one happen. I look forward to, not necessarily to that day, but to the clearer statement--clearer understanding by markets and the government of what the rules are going to be the day afterwards.",Statement,STATEMENT OF JOHN H.

"Mr. Cleaver","We are going to begin the conversation with the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Neugebauer, who has an appointment that he needs to keep and so we will begin with him, and then we will move to the other side.",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","I thank the gentleman for accommodating me. One of the things that I hope that we all agree on, and I think I hear, is that there are no more bailouts. That is bad for market discipline, that companies that make bad decisions have to suffer the consequences of that. And one of the elements of the Republican alternative is that we believe there are ways to do that. One is making sure that entities are adequately capitalized. But secondly, not having someone choose which companies are systemically risky to the marketplace and thereby giving them a free pass on their market activities. But I want to go to the resolution issue because I think it is probably as equally important in restoring market discipline. One of the things that I am very concerned about in the current bill is that it is a wheel of fortune, as I call it, when you get to the bankruptcy or to the dissolution of that entity. Because if someone is arbitrarily going to just choose which people get made whole and which aren't and which people get a certain percentage and not follow some orderly discharge of those obligations, how am I going to estimate what my risk is when I am either buying equity or I am buying security or buying debt or I am buying subordinated debt or taking an unsecured position or secured position if somebody else is going to determine what my position is? So the Republican plan quite honestly has designed about, as I think Mr. Cochrane was talking about, is that if there are--we actually set up a special chapter in the Bankruptcy Code, and if there are special powers or additional expertise that are needed to make that discharge, but that way everybody that is making an investment in an organization knows that if this investment does go south, they understand what their position is and not relying on the wheel of fortune in some cases where if the wheel turns in my direction, I went from an unsecured to a more preferential position. Your comments, Mr. Cochrane? I will start with you and kind of just go down the line there.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","Yes. I would agree with you. One thing that worries me about great power and no rules is precisely that means not only is it a wheel of fortune, it is a wheel of fortune that answers your phone calls. So there will be a lot of lobbying. It also means that the game of buying debt becomes not one of guessing what is the value of the assets, it is one of guessing what am I going to get out of the new resolution authority. And finally, we are acting as if it is simple. The whole reason we are worried about this is that the web of counterparties which are systemic, which aren't systemic, who should get money, who not, too complicated to think about. Well, goodness gracious, it is going to be even more complicated to think about it at 2 o'clock on a Sunday morning.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","I agree with many of the things that you said. The one thing I worry about and am concerned about is putting these institutions into bankruptcy. That has its own set of uncertainties as any firm going into bankruptcy and creditors know. And the problem is that the uncertainty can drag on for quite some time, because of the nature of these financial institutions. We don't have the time. So I think we need a resolution mechanism that is independent of the bankruptcy system. I don't think the system can be fixed to a sufficient degree to address those issues, and to take our chances in using bankruptcy, of course, for this process would in fact create greater uncertainty and cost taxpayers more in the long run.",Speech, 
"Mr. Neugebauer","As a follow-up to what you are saying, I think what we envision is a separate actually--possibly judicially, have special courts to do that, to have the expertise to make those decisions relatively quickly so that if there is a continuation possibility in that entity that there is the ability for someone to make those decisions at that particular point in time. It is not much different than the resolution concept except that we are going to have an orderly disposition in the event of a liquidation and settling that everybody understands. Mr. Miron?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","I would emphasize two aspects of your comments. One is I personally think there should be no more bailouts. Whatever the resolution system is, whether it is a bankruptcy court, a new kind of bankruptcy that no taxpayer money goes into it. Then the second point is, can we design a bankruptcy system, even for nonfinancial firms, that is smoother and faster than the current one. The answer is probably, but certainly it might be appealing to try to design something which is very fast and very smooth, say a default off the shelf and last will and testament that you have to create when you are incorporated. But I also think finally that the risks of the financial firm bankruptcies have been exaggerated. I don't say they were zero by any means, but I think there was a lot of claiming that the sky was going to fall in, which was not based on evidence in the historical records. Particularly before 1914, we had many, many financial panics. The vast majority were not associated with major changes in the economy. They were short. They were limited to a few firms and a few cities and the economy recovered very quickly.",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","You know, it is so hard to be formulaic about these issues and to try to define what is in the public mind and what isn't. When you are going through a panic, and we went through a panic, it is scary, very, very frightening. And I wouldn't take the position that there will be no more bailouts. We don't know what there is going to be or how great the threat is going to be. But if the resolution authority is so established where the onus is put on both creditors and shareholders they will be, in my judgment, in a much better position to evaluate the condition of given institutions than any regulator might be. I think holding their feet to the fire in that fashion will go a long way toward avoiding the kind of calamity that you speak of. As to the need for a systemic risk overseer in terms of a council that would serve as an early warning system, I think that makes a good deal of sense. It would be a hands-on group that would be led by a presidential employee. As an alternative, if the Fed were to get rid of its conflicts--and I think they have very profound conflicts which make them a less than ideal systemic risk regulator--I think the combination of these two could do a great deal to restore public confidence. If the public loses total confidence in the system, all of our pronouncements about ``too-big-to-fail'' and we can't afford the bailout, or what have you, go up in smoke. It is a power that should not be underestimated.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you. We are going to have votes in maybe 15 or 20 minutes. I do think we can get all members in if the members will use the Reader's Digest version of your questions and if you will give the Cliff Notes version of the answer, I think we can get through all of these. We will begin with the gentlelady from Illinois, Ms. Bean.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bean","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the witnesses for sharing your expertise today. Many of us have advocated for countercyclical capital requirements to avoid the kind of depth and width of the downfall that we recently experienced, specifically to discourage the type of leverage that we saw. And as Mr. Zandi said in his own testimony, if I understood it properly, suggesting that when we see a bubble in formation, obviously increasing capital requirements will maybe minimize how big that bubble gets. In a precipitous downfall we would ease up capital requirements as well, which we didn't do, so it doesn't get so wide as institutions divest themselves, even in this case non-subprime related assets. Given that history suggests that regulators, though they have the authority to impose those changes, tend not to want to be the buzzkill when the party is going, will regulators follow guidance from the Feds or does Congress really need to be more proscriptive in that regard and require those type of changes relative to capital requirements? I am asking Mr. Zandi specifically.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","I think it is a reasonable concern based on historical experience. Regulators don't step in when they need to. It is very difficult to do that. And in tough times, they put more pressure on institutions, and it can be counterproductive. I don't think it should be resolved legislatively. I think, though, it can be addressed through the various accounting rules that are adopted to try to effectuate a countercyclical effort to raise capital standards, various kinds of insurance. So I think if you can codify it in the accounting rules, I think that would be a more effective way of doing it. Once you start legislating it, then it becomes so binding that--we don't really know what is going to work well. Part of it is going to be experimentation, and it is hard to change legislation easily. So I think if you can make sure that the accounting rules are set in a way that this is done to your satisfaction, then that would be the more appropriate thing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","I think that is an important point. Accounting is really at the heart of much of the problem. We don't really know what many of these institutions hold in their portfolios. I really believe that we need fair market accounting on the part of financial institutions, and I think that a lot of this depends upon whether you are a deposit-taking institution that engages in transactions involving risk or whether you are not a deposit-taking institution. I think fair value accounting conveying a clear picture to investors of precisely what risk they may be taking is terribly important.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bean","Thank you, and I yield back.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Mr. Levitt, you say we shouldn't adopt the standard of no more bailouts. The Executive Branch believes not only that there should be a capacity for future bailouts but that it ought to be orderly. And by orderly, what they mean is no further congressional involvement, that if the Executive Branch wants to tie up $1 trillion, $2 trillion, and they think it is necessary, God, they are good people, they should be able to make that decision without the disorderliness that we saw last fall where Congress added a bunch of provisions, oversight, and even voted it down the first time. Do you believe that we ought to give the Executive Branch the authority to commit over $1 trillion to bail out systemically important firms in a time of crisis without further congressional approval?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","I would rather not be specific about that issue because again, it is so difficult to be in the eye of the storm and find yourself bound by formulaic restrictions.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Sir, you are an American. Do you believe in the Constitution or not? Is your loyalty to Wall Street greater than your loyalty to the Constitution?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","I don't think anything in my public life would lead anyone to that conclusion, Mr. Sherman.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Doesn't the Constitution say that appropriations are supposed to be made by Congress and that Congress doesn't just give the Executive Branch the right to, in some future instance, spend $1 trillion, $2 trillion, $3 trillion of taxpayer money without any congressional involvement? Doesn't it bother you as an American?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","I think Congress is intimately involved and has been intimately involved in this whole process or we wouldn't be sitting here right now.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Briefing a few congressional leaders is constitutionally irrelevant. The Constitution calls for votes on the Floor of Congress where even bald guys from California get to vote. For you to say that the principles of the Constitution are achieved because a few congressional leaders are briefed--",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","You are putting words in my mouth, Mr. Sherman. That is not what I said.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Perhaps you should speak for yourself.",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","You are misinterpreting what I have said. And I don't know that this is the appropriate forum to argue about constitutional support or constitutional values. Of course, I believe in the power of the Congress and the power of the people.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","Let me move on. There is an argument that the only way we can have institutions that are ``too-big-to-fail'' is to have a system for bailing them out if they do fail and of course higher capital requirements in the hope that they won't. The other approach is ``too-big-to-fail'' is too big to exist. We could have a rule that said no company can enter into contracts which caused them to be liable to American persons in excess of 1 percent of the U.S. GDP. This could be binding on foreign and domestic firms and so if a firm approached that limit, they might choose to break up, otherwise they cannot enter into new contracts which obligated them. Mr. Cochrane, is it better to have a system of larger and larger and larger tier 1 financial institutions where people know that if you are one of the top five you have a 50 percent chance at least of being bailed out if you get into trouble, or is it better to say ``too-big-to-fail'' is ``too-big-to- exist?''",Speech,

My sense is that in theory it would be nice to say that if you are ``too-big-to-fail,'' you are ``too-big-to-exist.'' But in reality, in practice, that is not going to happen. That won't happen. I don't think it is efficient. Our institutions won't be competitive globally.",Speech, 
"Mr. Sherman","If we impose on all institutions worldwide the same standard; that is, do not have liabilities to U.S. persons in excess of 1 percent of the U.S. GDP, that would allow all firms, no matter where headquartered, to have the same systemic risk to the U.S. economy.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","Two points. One is, why 1 percent? The second is, we live in a global financial system. We are not an island unto ourselves.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Mr. Manzullo, the gentleman from Illinois.",Speech, 
"Mr. Manzullo","Sometimes the hearing that has the fewest members turns out to be one of the most unusual. I always enjoy somebody who teaches at Harvard and is a senior fellow at the Cato Institute. That is interesting. I have big problems with the message that we are going to set up the safety net for your guys who screw up on Wall Street. I mean, that is how I look at this legislation. It has created an America that is looking for a bailout for everything. And people are smart enough to realize that there is no bailout, that the people who are actually either the--probably the water in the buckets are the taxpayers who have to take care of this load. Why have a piece of legislation, Mr. Miron, that, for example, you say in the very last line on page 3 of your testimony, ``thus this bill institutionalizes TARP for bank holding companies.'' Tell us what is wrong. Just go into depth on your statement.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","The crucial thing is that under this bill, it is not just that we have given the FDIC power to resolve, to settle the competing claims, which is similar to what a bankruptcy judge does, but we very explicitly said that the FDIC can borrow money from Treasury--that is explicitly in the bill--can use that money from Treasury to buy the debts of the failing institutions, to take equity stakes, to guarantee its obligations and all sorts of things. Now, there are provisions in the bill where allegedly the FDIC is going to recoup that money later on. The way it recoups it is truly bizarre. It recoups it by levying fees on all the remaining tier 1 financial institutions. So it is kind of like the deposit insurance system except it is ex post, not ex anti. So the incentive it sets up is for every one of those firms, take as much risk as you can, sometimes you will make a lot of profit. If you fail and you disappear, then the people who pay for that are all of the remaining firms in the industry. So of course every firm is going to be thinking that way, so they are all going to be simultaneously trying to outrisk each other. It is just an unmitigated recipe for disaster.",Speech, 
"Mr. Manzullo","There is a new form of capitalism called joint and several liability.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","It also gives them an incentive to make your failure as systemically fearful as possible, not just to make you get the bailout, but you want to hold a gun to everybody's head that you are as dangerous to the financial system as possible so that you can get the bailout.",Speech, 
"Mr. Manzullo","Does it bother you that institutions beyond financial institutions could be impacted by this legislation?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","In what manner?",Speech, 
"Mr. Manzullo","The broad swoop that could bring in a nonbank.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","Absolutely. First of all, the definition of what is an institution covered by this ends up being extremely malleable. So GMAC is probably going to come in, and if GMAC is in, then somehow General Motors gets in. You are going to have people who make toaster ovens who buy a small brokerage service firm, put it on their books, and they are covered and they are ``too-big-to-fail'' and have access to all of these Treasury funds, yes. It is just incredible--it is a blank check.",Speech, 
"Mr. Manzullo","Do you fellows feel that it would have been better if these banks and obviously the car companies had just filed straight Chapter 11 liquidation? Not Chapter 11, Chapter 7 or Chapter 11, that would be reorganization and Chapter 7 is straight bankruptcy. Use regular bankruptcy laws.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","Absolutely. Now, people correctly point to the fact that there are all of these counterparty claims that banks have and so if one fails it is likely to spill over into other institutions. That is exactly right, but that is only half the story. The other half of the story is it happens a few times and all of these banks and nonbank financial institutions are going to start taking on fewer counterparty risks. They are going to start to hedge better, they are going to take less risks, and they are going to start to adjust their behavior so that then the spillovers when one fails will not be nearly as extreme. And it is going to be painful to get to that point where people do business in a different way. But as Chairman Frank said at the very beginning, it is not going to start happening until we actually stick it to somebody.",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","I think the resolution authority is more effective than the bankruptcy law in terms of doing the job you want done. It is fairer.",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","It is fairer?",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","I am going to call on the gentleman from Colorado, Mr. Perlmutter.",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let us sort of get back to that last topic. That is the last thing that I need to understand. Chairman Levitt, how do we resolve broker-dealers?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","How do we resolve?",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","Broker-dealers. We have a court proceeding through a liquidation. How do we resolve banks and credit unions? Mr. Miron, how do we liquidate banks and credit unions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","The way we liquidate them now in is through the FDIC. In the vast majority of cases until recently--",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","We liquidate them. We liquidate them and sell and then we offload whatever are the bad debt and we tried to sell them, parcel them out, do something with them. Mr. Cochrane, how do we liquidate or how do we resolve insurance companies?",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","The key component--",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","How do we resolve insurance companies? Do you know? We liquidate them through the insurance commissioner. Now, guys, I am a Chapter 11 lawyer. I did it for 25 years. So if the Republicans want to have more Chapter 11, God bless them. I just don't see when you are dealing--when you have assets that are fairly liquid, whether they are stock certificates that you are holding or insurance policies you are holding or cash that you are holding, a Chapter 11 doesn't work very well because now you are dissipating potentially during the course of the reorganization assets that really belong to somebody else. Now, you know, I have done--I can't tell you how many Chapter 11's I have done. And you can see that by taking GM, Chrysler, they were able to go through Chapter 11, but they did a lot of work proceeding that to do the Chapter 11. So, in my opinion, if we have a holding company that may-- part of the problem is, I think, that we have institutions that are just too big and they also have too many products. They are stockbrokers, they are insurance companies and they are banks, all at the same time. And so now how do we deal with them in an orderly way? Everybody is using resolution authority. I call it something where we need to have an orderly liquidation. Now, do you think we can do that in a Chapter 11, really, Mr. Miron?",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","Yes. I agree that you are going to end up in many cases just liquidating. In some cases, depending on the nature of the different things that have been put together, some pieces are easily sold off and can operate; some pieces were perfectly solvent and profit-making.",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","So how do you manage those really liquid assets that might be a depositor's asset, or it is a bond or it is a stock certificate or something? See, the problem is, we have--",Speech, 
"Mr. Miron","I don't understand why we don't just sell it to the highest bidder. I am confused. Why doesn't it just get sold to the highest bidder?",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","Well, that would be a liquidation. That would be a Chapter 7. And I don't mean to--you guys use bankruptcy as if it is some general term. You do things differently in bankruptcy court.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","Can I make a point? We had a case study of a firm that went into bankruptcy, and we saw how well it went. Lehman Brothers is a case in point that went into bankruptcy. It was a complete mess. It would have been a complete fiasco if the government had not stepped in, in response to that. I think we saw pretty clearly what bankruptcy does. It does not work in the case of these large, very complicated institutions, which have very liquid assets that can go out the door immediately. It just didn't work and I don't think you can fix it to make it work.",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","I really would like to think that it could, okay? Now, I guess maybe I have done too many of them to recognize how long some of these things take and how complicated they get and how you fight about a particular subject in the court when these are the kinds of things that require resolution promptly, quickly, for the certainty that you are seeking, Mr. Miron and Mr. Cochran, the certainty that you are seeking for the marketplace?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","Or the certainty that resolution brings to the process by putting the creditors on notice that they, too, can lose everything before it happens.",Speech, 
"Mr. Perlmutter","Right. See, I don't want any more bailouts. I am with you guys. And I subscribe to the ``too-big-to-fail'' is ``too-big-to-exist.'' Great. Those are nice goals and platitudes. But when you are in an emergency, you are in an emergency, and all rules seem to go by the wayside because you just have to get the job done and keep the system going. I want to separate stockbrokers from the bankers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the time.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you. Mr. Foster from Illinois.",Speech, 
"Mr. Foster","Thank you. First, I would like to second my endorsement of Dr. Zandi's endorsement of periodic stress tests for potentially systemically important firms. So, for example, if specifically, all firms that have balance sheets that exceed 1 percent of GDP would be required to report in appropriate detail what their situation would be like under conditions of mild, moderate, or depression-like economic downturn. I think this would be a tremendous benefit. If you have comments on that, I would be interested in hearing them. The second thing I would be interested in hearing your comments on is the concept of requiring large firms to maintain a living will, essentially a pre-negotiated private sector bailout. A variation of this are these reverse convertible debentures, if I am pronouncing that correctly, where you essentially have things that convert to equity, and requiring firms that are approaching ``too-big-to-fail'' to hold a significant amount of debt in that form, so that when the trigger gets pulled, they automatically have a pre-negotiated, as I say, private sector bailout. And I think forcing institutions to confront the possibility of their demise, having the board of directors vote on, yes, this is the plan for dissolving ourselves if we fail, could have a tremendously positive cultural impact on Wall Street. So I would be interested. And finally, the last question is whether any of you are aware of anything that is understood about the efficiency of our economy as a function of the maximum allowable bank size. Like what is the hit in economic growth that we would take if we limited banks to certain sizes. If there is anything that is known about that academically, I would be very interested in hearing about it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","Well, let me say I think the idea of requiring institutions to have a living will as part of that process, also engaging in regular stress testing, would be very therapeutic. I think it would provide a lot of information to the marketplace, and I think it would be very therapeutic for the banks. It was actually surprising to me in the stress tests that were conducted back in the spring that it was such a chore for the institutions; you would think that they would have the mechanism for doing things like this. But in fact, they really did not. I think just going through that process was very enlightening for them, for the regulators and for, obviously, market participants, and it was very key to turning confidence around at a very important point in the crisis. I think it was very important and therapeutic. So I think that is vital. That is an interesting question about bank size and economic efficiency. I don't know of any academic literature, but that would be an interesting thing to explore.",Speech, 
"Mr. Foster","It certainly gets mentioned qualitatively. Every time we talk about limiting bank size, they say, oh no, this would be a disaster for economic efficiency. I would like to see the curve of economic efficiency versus bank size limits.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","It is a hard question, and I can't tell you the answer, but I can tell you the question. Which is, are banks so large because that is the natural--they are more efficient by being more large, or are banks more large because this gets them better access to bailouts and government protection? I have suspicions it is in the other direction, but I wish I had better evidence.",Speech, 
"Mr. Foster","Any other comments on this? Then I yield back.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized for 3 minutes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. But, Mr. Chairman, out of fairness, I am not sure that this young man has had--",Speech, 
"Mr. Himes","No, no. Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","Thank you. And I will be as terse and laconic as possible. Permit me to say that I don't have the time to lay the proper predicate, but, Mr. Levitt and Mr. Miron--Mr. Miron, following your logic, we would not use the FDIC for banks. We would use bankruptcy, following your logic. Now, with that aside, I would like to talk about this issue of pain that you use rather cavalierly. Pain needs to be defined, because pain can mean more than just a loss of money. It can also have something to do with the worth of money. Mr. Levitt, if you would, the pain of allowing AIG to go into bankruptcy, the pain of allowing Bear Stearns to go into bankruptcy, the pain of allowing Lehman to go into bankruptcy, the pain of allowing the auto industry--Chrysler and GM--to go into bankruptcy, what would that pain translate into locally, meaning within the United States and globally?",Speech, 
"Mr. Levitt","That pain has a danger that reverberates not just throughout the United States, but throughout the world, because what you are talking about is the pain of public confidence. And that loss of public confidence could lead to catastrophic results. So it is very hard to quantify the implications of job loss, of the cratering of institutional creations that were looked upon as symbols of stability, and it just shakes the confidence of the people to its very roots. So that is a very, very severe penalty.",Speech, 
"Mr. Green","My final comment would be this--and I will yield back. My concern is this; is that we are not paying enough attention to each other. My belief is that we all want a resolution authority, without spending tax dollars. But for some reason, we are saying such that it appears as though the other doesn't want it, when I think the folk on the other side desire it, and the folks on this side desire it. But I do think that there has to be some credence given to what Mr. Levitt has said. You can never say never in a world that is dynamic. It is not static. I remember Ronald Reagan saying that he would never sign a certain piece of legislation. He said that his feet--he was sealed in cement. And when he signed it, he said what you hear is that cement cracking right now. My point is, I am with all of you. We should not bail out. Never bail out again as long as we live. Don't want to do it, shouldn't have done it this time. Never. God forbid, if we have to, how do we do it? Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you. One of the questions that plagues me is the whole concept of ``too-big-to-fail,'' which may be also ``too-interconnected-to-fail.'' And I don't know if those are synonymous, ``too-big-to-fail'' and ``too-interconnected- to-fail.'' How do you read those, Dr. Zandi?",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","I think they are synonymous. I think you can be large, and if your connections are limited, and you are not going to affect other institutions, then I think you can be resolved in the normal course of affairs. I don't think that is significant. But generally, I mean, if you are large and big, that means you are interconnected. You can't become large and big unless you are. You have all these different relationships and moving parts and, therefore, big generally is synonymous with--",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","So should we restrict the connectedness?",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","I don't think you can.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","I mean, that prevents the snowball from rolling down the hill.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","I don't think you can, because these institutions need to have relationships all over the globe in different markets, you know; they are providing different kinds of products and services to the economy. So I don't think there is any logical way of doing that, no.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","I do think, sir, that you are asking an extremely important question that I hope you will ask more and more. Too-what-to-fail? Through last year I have heard lots of oh, there will be--the world will end. There will be systemic risk. And nobody says exactly what is the systemic risk that is going to cause the great calamity. Is it too big? Too interconnected? What exactly is the problem? Keep asking that question, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Zandi","Well, I could give an answer. Just go back to last September and October. It came to such a point that the-- because of the failure of Lehman, because of the near failure of AIG, because of other various events, the Nation's nonfinancial commercial paper market was frozen, literally. So blue chip companies that make everyday products were on the verge of shutting their businesses down. And I know this firsthand, because I was getting calls from senior management of major retailers saying, ``I am not going to get delivery of product to put onto my store shelf because this company can't get credit.'' So that was because of the interconnectedness of the financial system, and it bled right to the nonfinancial world, literally within a few days.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cochrane","It wasn't just because of Lehman Brothers failing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Cleaver","Okay. Under normal circumstances I would like to keep going on this, because I am very concerned about it. And if I had time, I would like to juxtapose what the Swedish Government did with what we did. They separated the troubled assets and created--we kind of flirted with this for a moment about the bad bank, which is a bad term. But since we don't have time, and since I don't want to miss the vote, I appreciate very much you sharing with us, and your time and your intellect. This has been very, very helpful and informative. There are some things I am supposed to say. So whatever I don't say that I am supposed to say, it is said. The committee is adjourned.",Speech,
