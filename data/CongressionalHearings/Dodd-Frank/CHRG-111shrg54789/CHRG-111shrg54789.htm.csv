"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. I would like to welcome all here this morning for this morning's hearing on ``Creating a Consumer Financial Protection Agency: A Cornerstone of America's New Economic Foundation.'' We want to thank you, Mr. Barr, for joining us, and our other witnesses we will hear from after your testimony, and the Members of the Committee who are here this morning. And, obviously, my good friend and colleague Richard Shelby, former Chairman of the Committee, will be making some opening comments as well. So let me take a few minutes and share with you my thoughts on this question and then turn to Richard for any comments he has. And since only a few of us are here this morning, Bob, if you have got any opening comments you would like to make as well, I will turn to you, and then we will go to you, Mr. Barr, for your testimony. This morning we are taking an important step in our efforts to modernize our financial regulatory system. The failure of that system in recent years has left our economy in peril, as we all know, and caused real pain for many hard-working Americans who did nothing wrong themselves. And so I would like to start by reminding everyone that the work we do here matters to real people, men and women in my home State of Connecticut and all across our Nation who work hard every day, play by the rules, and want nothing more than to make a better life for themselves and their families. These families are the foundation, as all of us know, of our economy and the reason that we are here in Washington working on this historic and critically important legislation. That is why the first piece of the Administration's comprehensive plan to rebuild our regulatory regime and our economy is something that I have championed as well, and that is, an independent agency whose job it will be to ensure that American consumers are treated fairly and honestly. Think about the moments when Americans engaged with financial service providers. Now, I am not talking about big- time investors or financial experts. We know those people have a level of sophistication. I am talking about just ordinary citizens, working people trying to secure a stable future for themselves and their families. They are opening checking accounts. They are taking out loans. They are building their credit. They are trying to build a foundation upon which their families' economic security can rest for years to come. These can be among the most important and stressful moments a family can face. Think of younger people who have carefully saved up for that down payment on a home. It might be a modest house, but it will be their first home, a starter home. Before they can move into their new home, however, they must sign on the dotted line for that first mortgage, with its pages and pages of complex and confusing disclosures. Who is looking out for them in that process? Think of a factory worker who drives 30 miles to and from work every day and that old car that is about to give out. He or she needs another one to make it through the winter, but wages are stagnant and the family budget is stretched to the max. He has got no choice but to go to navigate the complicated world of an auto loan. Who is looking out for that person at that moment? Think of a single mother--and there are many in our country--whose 17-year-old son or daughter has just gotten into his or her first choice of going to college. She is overjoyed for him or her, but worried about how she is going to pay for that tuition, which grows every year astronomically. Financial aid might not be enough, and she knows that as her son or daughter begins the next chapter in their lives filled with promise, they may be saddled with overwhelming debt. Who is looking out for that family under those circumstances? These moments are the reason that we have invested so much of our time and money to rebuild our financial sector, even though some of the very institutions that the taxpayers have propped up are responsible for their own predicaments. These moments are the reason why we serve on this Committee and why I believe we have all come to the Senate to try and make a difference in the lives of the people we represent. And these moments are the reason that I and many of my colleagues were enraged by the spectacular failure of consumer protection that destroyed economic security for so many of our American families. In my home State of Connecticut and around the country, working men and women who did nothing wrong have watched this economy fall through the floor, taking with it their jobs, their homes, their life savings, and the cherished promise of the American middle class. These people are hurting. They are angry and they are worried, and they are wondering whether anyone is looking out for them. Since the very first hearings before this Committee on modernizing our financial regulatory structure, I have said that consumer protection should be a top priority in our deliberations. Stronger consumer protection could have stopped the crisis before it started, in my view. And where were the regulators in all of this? We know now that for 14 years, despite a clear directive from the U.S. Congress, the Federal Reserve Board took no action to ban abusive home mortgages. Gaping holes in the regulatory fabric allowed mortgage brokers and bankers to make and sell predatory loans to Wall Street that turned into toxic securities and brought our economy to its knees. That is why many of us call for the creation of an independent consumer protection agency whose sole focus is the financial well-being of consumers, an agency whose goal it is to put an end to lending practices that have ripped off far too many American families, and the Administration has sent us a very bold and I believe thoughtful plan for that agency. You would think financial services companies would support protections that ensure the financial well-being of their consumers. An independent consumer protection agency can and should be very good for business, not just for consumers. It can and should protect the financial well-being of American consumers so that businesses can rely on a healthy customer base as they seek to build long-term profitability. It can and should eliminate the regulatory overlap and bureaucracy that comes from the current Balkanized system of consumer protection regulation. It can and should level the playing field by applying a meaningful set of standards, not only to the highly regulated banks but also to their nonbank competitors that have slipped under the regulatory radar screen. Financial services companies that want to make an honest living should welcome this effort to create a level playing field. Indeed, the good lenders--and there are many--are the most disadvantaged when fly-by-night brokers and fly-by-night finance companies set up shop down the street. Then we see bad lending pushing out the good. No Senator on this Committee, Democrat or Republican, wants to stifle product innovation, limit consumer choice, or create regulation that is unnecessary or unduly burdensome. And I welcome the constructive input from those in the financial services sector--who share our commitment, by the way, to making sure that American families get a fair shake. We all want financial services companies to thrive and succeed, but they are going to have to make their money, in my view, the old-fashioned way: by developing innovative products, pricing competitively, providing excellent consumer service, and engaging in fair competition on the open market. The days of profiting from misleading or predatory practices need to be over with completely. The path to recovery of our financial services companies and our economy is based on the financial health of American consumers. I believe that very deeply. We need a system that rewards products and firms that create wealth for American families, not one that rewards financial engineering that generates profits for financial firms by passing on hidden risks to investors and borrowers. The fact that the consumer protection agency is the first legislative item the Administration has sent to Congress since it released its white paper on regulatory reform last month tells me that our President's priorities are in the right place. Nevertheless, with the backing of the Administration, with the support of many in the financial community who understand the importance of this reform, and, most of all, with a mandate from the American families I have discussed who count on a fair and secure financial system, I believe that we will push forward and succeed. I thank all of you for being with us here today as we move forward on this issue. Let me say, as I have said many times already in discussions both informally and formally, Richard Shelby, my partner in all of this, he and I are determined to work together on this to get this right. This is not one where we bring a lot of ideology to this debate but, rather, what works, what makes sense, what will restore the confidence and optimism of people all across this country--and, for that matter, around the world, who look to the United States as a safe and secure place and an innovative place to come and park their hard-earned dollars and hard-earned money. And so, with that, I thank again everyone for being here, and let me turn to Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Committee today, as the Chairman has already said, will examine the Administration's proposal to establish a stand- alone consumer protection agency. Well-regulated and transparent financial markets have been and must continue to be one of the central goals of our financial regulatory system. The purpose of our markets is to benefit consumers by giving them ways to save, invest, and conduct transactions. Consumers are not likely to participate in our markets, however, unless they know they are protected against fraud and unfair dealings. In addition, consumers are more likely to use financial products if they have the information they need to make good financial decisions. By creating confidence in our markets, consumer protection promotes consumer participation, which in turn provides additional benefits by increasing the size, vitality, and resilience of our financial system. Good consumer protection, therefore, makes good economic sense. Since the start of the ongoing financial crisis, I have stated that we should approach regulatory reform in a thorough and deliberate manner. I believe this Committee should examine what caused this financial crisis, develop solutions to the problems identified by that examination, and then consider the practical consequences of any reform measures. This morning, we begin our examination of the Administration's proposal. This is our first chance to review the Administration's findings regarding the problems they have identified and the solutions that they seek. As part of our consideration, I believe it would be very useful, if not necessary, for the Administration to submit for the record the data and the evidence they used to craft a regulatory restructuring proposal. It might be very helpful to us here. In addition, the fact that the Administration has produced a legislative draft gives us a chance to consider some of the practical questions associated with the proposal. For example, how will this new agency interact with the other banking regulators? Who will have the final discretion over things like capital treatment for alternative mortgage products or other consumer credit products? What authority would the Administration leave to State banking regulators? What if there is a disagreement between a prudential supervisor and the new consumer protection agency? What if a prudential supervisor fails to operate in a manner consistent with the consumer protection agency's guidelines? Will a prudential supervisor be allowed to overrule the consumer protection agency? Will certain types of financial products be banned? What standards would be used to make the decision to remove products from the marketplace? Beyond the practical issues regarding the program, I want to highlight some conceptual issues that I believe we must recognize as we consider financial consumer protection reform. First, I believe that we must clearly acknowledge and accept that risk cannot be eliminated from our financial markets? It is risk taking that generates return. It would be both false and irresponsible to lead the American people to believe that an enhanced regulator can provide them with risk- free opportunities. Second, I believe that we must also acknowledge that the risk associated with financial products are largely depending on the circumstances surrounding a particular transaction and the consumer. Some have tried to make oversimplistic analogies comparing defective consumer products to certain financial products. This is inaccurate, and I believe it is highly inappropriate. For example, a defective electrical device is dangerous under every circumstance where it is used. We know that. But that is not the case for financial products. A plain-vanilla 30-year fixed mortgage is not inherently safer, some argue, than a shorter adjustable rate product? In fact, a 30-year fixed mortgage could involve high costs and provide less value to the consumer. We have to look at the circumstances. Consumers need the relevant information and the means to understand it so they can purchase products and engage in the transactions that best fit their needs and circumstances. This point bears on what I believe is finally the most important issue associated with consumer protection reform. Who is best able to decide about the value and the necessity of any particular financial product or service? Some, including those in the Administration, have decided that consumers will not act in their own best interests and, therefore, it is necessary that we remove or greatly restrict products that in some situations might cause financial harm. Implied in this belief is the notion that some people, such as the Government bureaucrats, can make informed decisions about the value of products and services while others, such as the American consumer, cannot. In other words, ``Yes, we can,'' has become ``No, you can't.'' While I can accept the view that in some cases consumers do not have the necessary information or understanding to make sound financial decisions, I do not accept the premise that the remedy is to deny consumers decision-making power altogether. I think this would be a very significant and paternalistic departure from the notions of liberty and personal responsibility that have previously guided all our regulatory efforts. Quite frankly, I find it a bit disturbing and somewhat offensive that the concept of the ``intellectually deficient consumer'' has now found a voice in our legislative process. To the extent that there is any merit to this theory, I believe it would be better to provide those with deficiencies the means to address them rather than seizing from them their right to make free and informed choices. And while I look forward to hearing from our witnesses, I am greatly concerned over many aspects of the President's plan, not to mention its underlying premise. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. And with that, we will turn to you, Mr. Barr, for your opening statement and any supporting material or data you think would be valuable for the Committee to have at this point. Why don't you go ahead? Try and keep your remarks down, if you can, to 5 or 10 minutes or so.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Certainly. Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, thank you very much, Ranking Member Shelby. It is a pleasure to be back here to talk with you about the Administration's proposal for a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, a strong financial regulatory agency charged with just one job: looking out for consumers across the financial services landscape. The need could not be clearer. Today's consumer protection system is fundamentally broken. It has just experienced a massive failure. This failure cost millions of responsible consumers their homes, their savings, and their dignity. And it contributed to the near collapse of our financial system. There are voices today saying that the status quo is fine or good enough, that we should just keep the bank regulators in charge of protecting consumers, that we just need some patches to our broken system. They even claim consumers are better off with the current approach. It is not surprising that we are hearing these voices. As Secretary Geithner observed last week, the President's proposals would reduce the ability of financial institutions to choose their own regulator and to continue financial practices that were lucrative for a time, but that ultimately proved so damaging to households and our economy. Entrenched interests resist change always. Major reform always brings out fear mongering. But responsible financial institutions and providers have nothing to fear. We all aspire to the same objectives for consumer protection regulation: independence, accountability, effectiveness, and balance. The question is how to achieve them. A successful regulatory structure for consumer protection requires a focused mission, marketwide coverage, and consolidated authority. Today's system has none of these qualities. It fragments jurisdiction for consumer protection over many regulators, most of which have higher priorities than protecting consumers. Nonbanks avoid Federal supervision; no Federal consumer compliance examiner lands at their doorsteps. Banks can choose the least restrictive supervisor among several different banking agencies with respect to consumer protection. Fragmentation of rule writing, supervision, and enforcement leads to finger-pointing in place of action and makes the action that is taken less effective. The President's proposal for one agency, for one marketplace with one mission--to protect consumers--will change that. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency will create a level playing field for all providers, regardless of their charter or corporate form. It will ensure high and uniform standards across the financial services marketplace. It will end profits based on misleading sales pitches and hidden fee traps, along the lines of those that Senator Shelby and Chairman Dodd worked together to end in the credit card market. But there will be plenty of profits made on a level playing field where banks and nonbanks can compete fairly on the basis of price and quality. If we create one Federal regulator with consolidated authority, we will be able to leave behind regulatory arbitrage and interagency finger-pointing. And we will be assured of accountability. Our proposal ensures, not limits, consumer choice; it preserves, not stifles, innovation; it strengthens, not weakens, depository institutions; it will reduce, not increase, regulatory costs; and it will increase, not reduce, national regulatory uniformity. Successful consumer protection regulation requires mission focus, marketwide coverage, and it requires expertise and effectiveness through a consolidated supervisory entity. Consumer protection requires a mission focus for accountability, expertise, and effectiveness. A new supervisor must have marketwide jurisdiction to ensure consistent and high standards for everyone. And an effective regulator requires authority for regulation, supervision, and enforcement to be consolidated. A regulator without the full kit of tools is frequently forced to choose between acting with minimal effect and not acting at all. We need to end the finger-pointing. The rule writer that does not supervise providers lacks information it needs to determine when to write or revise rules and how best to do so. The supervisor that does not write rules lacks a marketwide perspective or adequate incentives to act. Splitting authorities is a recipe for inertia, inefficiency, and lack of accountability. The present system of consumer protection is not designed to be independent or accountable, effective, or balanced. It is designed to fail. It is simply incapable of earning and keeping the trust of the American people. Today's system does not meet a single one of the requirements I just laid out. The system fragments jurisdiction and authority for consumer protection over many agencies, most of which have higher priorities than protecting consumers. Nonbanks avoid Federal supervision; banks can choose the least restrictive supervisor; and fragmentation of rule writing, supervision, and enforcement leads to finger-pointing in place of action. This structure is a welcome mat for bad actors and irresponsible practices. Responsible banks and credit unions are forced to choose between keeping market share and treating consumers fairly. The least common denominator sets the standard, standards inevitably erode, and consumers pay the price. Mr. Chairman, if you look at the range of problems that have been occurring in the marketplace through this fragmented jurisdiction, I think that it is clear that the American public cannot afford more of the same. The problems that we had in the mortgage market--exploding ARMs, rising loan balances, credit card tricks such as double-cycle billing and late fee traps, the extent of failures in the past--are just unacceptable for us in the future, and the system we have had that led to this is structurally flawed. It is not capable of being fixed through tinkering around the edges. The problem is the structure itself. That problem has only one effective solution: the creation of one agency for one marketplace with one mission--to protect consumers of financial products and services, and the authority to achieve that mission. It is time for a level playing field for financial services competition based on strong rules, not based on exploiting consumer confusion. It is time for an agency that consumers-- and their elected representatives--can hold fully accountable. The Administration's legislation fulfills these needs. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss our proposal, and I would be happy to answer any questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MICHAEL S. BARR, ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you very much, and I did not give you a proper introduction to begin with, and I apologize. Mr. Barr is the Assistant Secretary for Financial Institutions at the Department of Treasury, and I should have made the formal introduction, so forgive me for not doing so.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much for your testimony. As I said at the outset, if you have any additional data that you think would be helpful for the Committee in its consideration, we would appreciate your submitting that to us as well. And I will ask the clerk to put us on a 5-minute clock, if you would here, and we will try and stay to that time. Let me, if I can, be sort of the devil's advocate with you because I anticipate these sorts of questions will be raised by my colleagues as well. I know you have spent a lot of time in your testimony on this point, but I think it is worth reiterating. Why do you think a separate consumer protection agency is necessary? And why wouldn't we just simply beef up the existing regulatory bodies? Let us even assume we end up consolidating a number of these regulatory bodies so they are far more efficient, we stop the regulatory arbitrage that is going on too often, the shopping, the charter shopping that we talked about. Why not just beef them up, give them additional personnel, and tell them they ought to be doing a better job? In effect, aren't they supposed to be consumer protection agencies in their own right? And so why in the world would you go around and create a whole new one? And wouldn't you, in fact, be then minimizing the importance of these other bodies if they end up deferring that consumer protection function to one agency and they are not doing the job they were supposed to be doing in addition to their regulatory functions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we have had a long experiment with having the prudential supervisors over banks responsible for consumer protection supervision, having another agency--the Federal Reserve--responsible for rule writing, having yet another agency--the Federal Trade Commission--responsible for after-the-fact enforcement in the nonbanking sector. And I think what we have seen and what the American public has just experienced is a massive failure of that system. And it was a massive failure of that system because of the very structure of the system. There were good people at the Federal Reserve, for example, who wanted to effectuate strong consumer protections. You might even say there were heroic people at the Federal Reserve who wanted to effectuate consumer protection. Ned Gramlich, who was a dear friend of mine, the Vice Chair of the Federal Reserve, wanted to get consumer protection done, and the very structure of the Federal Reserve, its very focus on what it viewed as prudential supervision, its inability to move quickly on consumer protection blocked reform in the mortgage market that could have helped avert this crisis. So I think we have had a long and disastrous experience with having bank agencies with a mixed mission, with no one focused on protecting consumers, with no one able to set rules and supervise across the financial services marketplace, with no one able to say there is going to be a level playing field with high standards for everybody. And what we saw is the market tipped to bad practices. We saw it tip to bad practices in credit cards, practices which you and Mr. Shelby so effectively blocked in the credit card bill this spring. We saw it shift, tilt to bad practices in the mortgage market in ways that were disastrous for the American people. And I just don't think we can afford that experiment any longer. We have to have a fresh start with a new agency whose sole mission is standing up for the American people.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me continue my role as the devil's advocate. One of the arguments we are going to hear is this will restrict the availability of credit to consumers, restrict their choices; that a way that the financial institutions will respond to this is just start saying no to a lot of people who otherwise might have a chance to get that car loan, get that started house; and so if you want us to make sure we are not going to make any mistakes at all, not take any risks at all, then we just won't provide that kind of extension of credit to an awful lot of people out there. How do we respond to the question that consumer credit and consumer choices are going to be severely limited if, in fact, you get so heavy-handed with a consumer protection agency that the very people you are designing it to help here are actually going to be hurt by this idea?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Mr. Chairman, I think that is exactly the thing to be focused on, and in our legislative draft, we suggest that the agency be required to assess not just the benefits of its rules, but the costs of its rules; that it be required not just to look at questions of consumer protection but also questions of access; that it be required to evaluate its major rule writing every 5 years to ensure that it is keeping up with changes in the marketplace at a minimum; that it be required to be held accountable through notice and comment rulemaking, even when it is not going to do a rule, to let the public and financial institutions comment on how it is doing its job. I think it has got to weigh the costs and the benefits. It has got to be a balanced entity. But what we want to see is a level playing field, access for everyone based on high standards. We want consumers to be able to choose whatever product they want, whatever credit card they want, whatever mortgage loan they want, whatever payday loan they want. We want them to be able to choose loans, to choose products, to choose services. We want the consumer to be empowered to do that. We want it to be done on a level playing field with high standards. So what they are choosing is based on transparency and honesty and integrity in the process.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Two final questions for you. I made the point in my opening statement that I thought if this were done well and right--as I plan to do so--that it is not only going to be beneficial to consumers, but the one argument we do not hear is that it is very beneficial to business, very beneficial to the financial institutions themselves to have a consumer protection agency, number one. And, number two, a witness who will appear in the second panel, Mr. Wallison from the American Enterprise Institute, says in his statement here, ``If we are looking for a primary cause of today's financial crisis, it is here,'' referring to the Community Reinvestment Act. Why don't you respond to the issue of whether or not you believe the Community Reinvestment Act was the primary cause of the financial crisis as well?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me first say I agree with you that the Consumer Financial Protection Agency is good for banks as well as for consumers. If banks are competing on the basis of price and quality, that is good for them. If banks and credit unions and their communities can compete on a level playing field so we do not have a situation where a community bank wants to do the right thing but an independent mortgage company is stealing all market share with a policy that consumers cannot understand, we don't want that in the future. We want a level playing field based on fair competition, based on transparency to consumers. With respect to the Community Reinvestment Act, I think the empirical evidence here, Mr. Chairman, is quite strong. I looked at this when I was researching at the University of Michigan. The Federal Reserve economists have looked at this question. The Federal Reserve found that about 6 percent of subprime mortgage loans were made by CRA-regulated institutions with respect to low-income communities or low-income borrowers. Six percent is unlikely to have driven, highly unlikely to have driven the subprime mortgage crisis. If you look at the timing of our subprime mortgage crisis in the mid-2000's, it is hard to imagine that that was caused by changes in CRA regulations a decade earlier in 1995. If you look at the performance of CRA lending with respect to equivalent subprime loans, comparable performance levels. So I think the empirical evidence just does not support that claim.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","They have very strong underwriting standards with CRA. The Community Reinvestment Act required very strong underwriting standards to be met by the borrowers. Is that true?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Secretary Barr, the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency embodies the notions of behaviorally informed regulation that you wrote about in an article published in October of last year. The premise of that article, as I understood it, was that--and I will quote--``Individuals consistently make choices that they themselves agree diminish their own well-being in significant ways.'' That was in the article. This dim view of the capabilities of the average American contrast with the author's belief, as we understood it, that bureaucrats are capable of discerning what financial products and services would maximize the well-being of individuals that they don't even know. Why do you believe that bureaucrats working for a Consumer Financial Protection Agency would be able to make better decisions than American consumers themselves?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the opportunity to make clear that that is not my view. In the first case----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Was that in this article?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The quote is in the article, but the material that followed that you articulated was not in the article. So the material that followed is the point that I would say is not my view. I would say it in two particular respects. One is I think the common human failing that we identified in the article are not about us versus them. They are common human failings that all of us have. All of us make mistakes in our daily lives. I get overdraft----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","We learn from those mistakes, don't we?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We do learn from those mistakes, and sometimes those mistakes are quite costly. But we all make them, is the only point I--I wasn't trying to say--I am not speaking for you, sir, but I know I make those mistakes all the time.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I probably make more. Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","So just to be clear on that. So these are mistakes that I make, at least, and that other people make and that are common mistakes, and our idea in the legislation is not to prevent people from making mistakes. It is to make it easier for them to avoid mistakes. Just easier for them to avoid mistakes. So if you have a product that people cannot understand, then we need to figure out a way of making it easier for them to understand.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I agree with that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","And, Mr. Shelby, I know you worked very hard on the credit card legislation to make sure that credit card products and services are offered in a transparent way, and to let people know the consequences of their financial decisions for the cost of making those choices, and that is exactly the kind of approach that is embodied in this legislation.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Is your premise basically trying to take risk out of a marketplace? And if there is no risk, there is no marketplace, is there?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Sir, I think that risk and innovation are central to our financial system.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","We benefit from it, don't we?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We at times benefit from it and at times have costs from it, and on balance, financial innovation and risk taking are central to our system. What we are talking about here is not eliminating risk, certainly not eliminating financial innovation. Quite the contrary. I think those are central concepts. But we have to see that happen on a level playing field with high standards so that people are competing based on price and quality and not consumer confusion.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","The board of the consumer--the composition of the board, the proposal of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency would include the Director of the National Bank Supervisors and four members of the President's choosing. There is no limit on the number of members who are from the same political party. This contrasts, as you well know, with the limits on the composition of both the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Consumer Product Safety Commission. Why did you choose such a politically biased construct at this point knowing that would raise red flags for some?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Shelby, I would not describe it as politically biased in any way. In fact, it is designed to be not political, so there is not an identification of parties with respect to those matters. And the board----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","You do not say that, but that is what the result would be.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","And if you look, for example, Mr. Shelby, at the Federal Reserve Board, we see a balanced range of individuals on the Federal Reserve Board without a particular requirement of party identification.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I would like to just restate a request I made in my opening statement. I am sure the Administration used a great deal of detailed data--you know, you had to--and analysis that led to this proposal, because we would do this, too. Would you please provide that data and your analysis of that data to the Committee--not just to me, but the Chairman and all of us, staff on both sides--so that we can use it in our effort to evaluate your proposal? In other words, look at your data, evaluate it, weigh it, because we might agree with it. We might not. Would you do that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We would be happy to work with the Committee to provide whatever information would be available and useful to you.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","You state, Mr. Secretary, repeatedly that the status quo is not acceptable because things are changing every day in the marketplace, as we know, and the need for a new independent consumer protection regime could not be clearer. In addition, you state that, ``Banks can choose the least restrictive supervisor among several banking supervisors.'' Yet the Administration leaves in place in their overall proposal exactly that fragmented system for prudential supervision, four or five regulators. Why is it that we must and why would you propose only one agency responsible for consumer protection, but four Federal banking agencies is entirely appropriate for safety and soundness regulation of our system? Why would you do that if you are going to have the other? If we had one prudential banking regulator, you could draw the analogy, but I don't know how you do it here.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Our view was that in the context of prudential supervision and the arbitrage that we had seen on the prudential side, that we could effectively deal with that problem by merging the OCC and the OTS into a new national bank supervisor, and eliminating the thrift charter, eliminating the remaining distinctions between State member banks, State nonmember banks, and national banks, and requiring a series of protections against charter conversion in the event that there were pending enforcement matters, pending problems at any of the institutions. It is not, I would agree, a perfect answer to that question, and in the context of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency, the problems that we saw were so pervasive, the basic structural problems so severe, the extent of mission conflict and mission confusion so strong, that we felt the only real answer there was a Consumer Financial Protection Agency.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Secretary, in a panel that will follow you, Mr. Yingling, who is the representative of the American Bankers Association, has a series of critiques, and I would like to go through some of them with you and see what your responses are. First of all, he talks about how community banks are likely to have greatly increased fees to fund a system that falls disproportionately and unfairly on them, as they were not part of the present crisis. Second, he talks about this agency having the power to compel the use of certain products that the agency would define. Third, he talks about two lessons that he believes are fundamental building blocks of any reform of consumer protection oversight: One is that the uniform regulation and supervision of consumer protection performance should be applied to nonbanks as rigorously as it has been applied to the banking industry; and two, that regulatory policymakers for consumer protection should not be divorced from the responsibility for financial institution safety and soundness. And he talks about how the failure of nonbank regulation was the most severe under the current system. So looking at those as some of the main points of critique of the legislation, how do you respond to those?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator Menendez. I would be happy to address those four concerns. First, with respect to community banks, community banks have endured a system under which they are forced to compete with independent mortgage companies and other unregulated lenders in the system. They have been forced essentially by market pressure to offer products and services that, if you are in their community and you talk to community bankers, they would rather not have offered. They would rather not have gotten engaged in pay option ARMs. But because or the unlevel playing field in supervision and regulation, the market tilted to bad practices, and market pressure drove the market to a place that was bad for community banks and it was bad for consumers. What we are saying here is there is going to be a level playing field for community banks, for big banks, for independent mortgage brokers, for anybody else in the marketplace. One regulator is going to set the standards, everybody can compete equally, on an equal footing.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Are you saying that the proposed legislation that the Administration advocates is going to reach to those previously unregulated entities?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Absolutely, sir. One of the key features of this legislation is that nonbank providers for the first time are going to get subject to supervision and examination and enforcement with the same tools available to bank regulators. So the legislation would say the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency would apply these strong consumer standards across the board so that no one competes on the basis of an unlevel playing field or hiding the ball. Second, with respect to the point about compelling the use of products, the agency here is offering a lighter touch form of regulation than banning or restricting products or services. What the legislation provides is if the agency sees a problem in the marketplace where some products and services are more confusing based on more difficult terms for consumers, instead of saying you can't offer that product at all--right?--which in some instances an agency would want to say, Oh, we want to ban that kind of product or service, in this instance the agency has a different tool, a more flexible and more nuanced tool. They can say, Look, if you want to offer a pay option ARM, you have to show a consumer first what a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage would look like or what a regular adjustable rate mortgage looks like, what a 5-1 ARM without hidden features or terms looks like, so they can compare and make their own judgment, make their own choice, but make it based on something that they can understand and that is comparable across the marketplace. Third, with respect to nonbanks, let me just reiterate nonbanks will be subject to the same high standards, the same rules, the same supervision, the same examination, the same enforcement as banks for the first time ever. And, last, with respect to the link to safety and soundness, again, I think we have had a system. We just experienced what it is like to have massive failure in a system in which bank supervisors do safety and soundness and also do consumer protection. And what happened is they did not do safety and soundness in a good way, and they did not do consumer protection in a good way. We had a massive failure in our system. And we need to reform it. We need to give them a single--the bank regulators need to have a single mission focused on safety and soundness, and we need a new consumer protection agency whose sole mission is consumer protection. Agencies can then have one job. They can be held accountable for doing that job. And you all can go out and talk to them and say, ``This is your job. Why aren't you doing it?''",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thanks for having this hearing. Mr. Secretary, thank you for your service. I am going to digress just for 1 second. I think you may be the overall architect, if you will, of much of what has been put forth as it relates to regulatory changes, and I have been somewhat curious that the GSEs were not addressed, and if we could just spend about 30 seconds on that. Obviously, the largest liabilities that we as a country have, other than Medicare and Social Security, are within those GSEs, and yet at a time when you in essence own them, we are not in any way looking at changing their status or moving them along into a different direction. I am just wondering why you all chose not to address that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator Corker. In the Treasury Department's report, we highlighted the fundamental need that you articulated just now to reform those institutions, and we promised to come back to the Congress at the time of the President's budget submission in February with a reform proposal, and really our judgment was just about sequencing of what we could get done with you. We think it is a high priority to get done. We will be proposing legislation to you with respect to reform of the Government-sponsored enterprises, looking at our mortgage finance system as a whole. And between now and then, we will be holding a series of public meetings as well as engaging in our own internal deliberations to focus exactly on that question. You are right. We need to address it.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","When is ``then''? When is ``then,'' when you are going to be proposing this----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Oh, I am sorry. At the time of the President's budget submission, which is in February of the coming year.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So would you urge us to wait on regulatory reform until after that point so that we can address it all?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Our judgment, again, Senator Corker, I do not have--you all are obviously keepers of your own calendar, and I would not want to suggest anything with respect to that. Our own judgment in terms of the sequencing is that we could move forward expeditiously on the financial reforms measure we have put in place, that we have suggested that you put in place, and next turn to the Government-sponsored enterprises in February. I do not think we can afford to wait for 6 or 7 months to do that. I think we need to act now and put in place these essential measures for the financial system.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So sort of a developing theme, I think, within the Administration, not necessarily with yourself, is that we have a lot of smart people who work with us that know better than the average citizen what ought to happen in so many areas, and it is just a theme that continues to evolve. So as I look at this agency--and I no doubt believe that consumer protection ought to take place. For the first time--and a lot of people have sort of compared this to consumer product safety, but, in essence, you all are advocating that you design products for the financial industry. That is a major departure from anything that has happened in any other category of the economy that I am aware of. But you guys would be designing products that all institutions had to conform to, which is very different than product safety. They usually test products that are designed by others afterwards to see that they are safe. I am just wondering, what is it that drives you all to that extreme?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Corker, thank you for the opportunity to clarify again that that is not at all what we have in mind. So under this Consumer Financial Protection Agency, financial institutions can continue to offer any product or service that they want. The point of having a simple product offering is to say if you are going to offer a complex product like a pay option ARM, you also have to offer a straightforward product that exists in the marketplace--a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage with straightforward pricing and terms; a 5-1 or 7-1 ARM with straightforward pricing and terms. So I think that if you look at the language that we have proposed, the factors that the agency is supposed to take into account, this is not designed to dictate all the products and services. It is not designed to----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","But it does dictate some, right? Because you are dictating by virtue of what you just said.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","It says certain products or services that are standard products and services, if you are going to offer exotic products and services, you also have to show the consumer what it would cost to take out a straightforward product that exists in the marketplace.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So if Senator Warner, who has been a tremendous entrepreneur, wanted to create a niche product to serve the public, he would not be able to offer that niche product unless he offered all of these other standard products, which if he were a new boutique kind of company that was trying to meet the need of a small part of our population that needed that service, he would be unable to do that under your legislation unless he offered all of these other types. Is that correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, if you look at the areas in which this might apply, we are talking about, let's say, again, in the mortgage context, if an entrepreneur wanted to offer a pay option ARM, they would need to show the consumer what a 30-year fixed-rate or regular ARM would look like in terms of cost so the consumer can compare and make their own choices. They would still be able to offer these other products and services in whatever way they would like, but they would need to have a point of comparison that shows what the costs and risks are in relation to that standard.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I have a number of questions, and I guess we may have another round. I do not know if that is true or not. So what you are saying is this new entity under your proposal is not going to lay out basic requirements for certain types of products. You are not going to do that. Yes or no?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, with respect to what a standard product is, you would be able to say a 30-year fixed-rate or a regular ARM is a standard product, and if you wanted to offer other products, that is fine; but you have got to compare it to this product, too. You would not be saying----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","And you have to offer that product----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","You have to offer the standard product if you are going to offer the exotic product.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","OK. Well, I think my time is up, but I think what you have just said, again, is that smaller innovative companies that want to enter a market, which is what our country is about as it relates to innovation--that is why we are the leader that we are in the world. You are basically saying that these entities, unless they offer other standard products, would not be able to be in business. That is a large departure from where we have been as a country, and I want to revisit that with you. And I thank you for your service and your testimony.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you for your testimony and for your presentation of this agency. It certainly has been a long time since we have had an agency that was dedicated to consumers in the financial world, and we have certainly seen many practices that have damaged the financial foundations of our working families. And so I certainly applaud the Administration for bringing this forward. In your testimony and in follow-up questions, you talked about a level playing field. I wanted to ask about one aspect of that. If a State, for example, decided that it wanted to ban yield spread premiums or incentives to brokers to basically sell a more complicated product, a more expensive product, wanted to ban those or make them perhaps transparent, at least to be displayed to the consumer so the consumer understands where the broker is receiving their compensation, would they be able to do that under this legislation? And would it apply to all folks who offer or only for State-chartered institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you very much, Senator Merkley. So under our proposal, if a State wanted to have higher standards than exist under Federal law, they would be able to apply those standards. Under our proposal, the broad preemption provisions that had previously applied to national banks and their subsidiaries would not apply in that circumstance, so the higher standard would be available for institutions operating in that marketplace.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","So this would eliminate the unfairness that has arisen in part in the past where State-chartered institutions might have been subject to higher standards imposed by the State, but had federally chartered competitors who were not subject to those standards?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Second, I wanted to ask you about a phrase, there is a set of tests in the law for what can be done, and to quote, ``The agency must have a reasonable basis to conclude that the act or practices cause or are likely to cause substantial injury to consumers which is not reasonably avoidable by consumers, and such substantial injury is not outweighed by countervailing benefits.'' So we have a ``substantial'' test, a ``not reasonably avoidable'' test, and a ``not outweighed by countervailing benefits.'' Can you expand a little bit on those, and particularly this ``not reasonably avoidable''? And let me give you an example. I have a constituent, an elderly constituent, who cashed in a check that came in the mail that was from an established financial institution that he did business with. He thought it was related to simply a refund of an excess escrow fees or something of that nature. And, in fact, what it was in the fine print on the back was a high-interest loan--a very high- interest loan. And then the bank turned around and asked him to consolidate that loan with his other debt, and he ended up converting basically a very sound financial situation in short order into a situation that destroyed his equity in short order. But one could argue that he could reasonably have avoided that by simply not depositing the check, that he could have read all of the fine print on the back of the check and made sure he understood it. How does this test work in kind of the real world?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you very much, Senator. The intent of the provision is to ensure that when the agency is thinking about the options available to it in regulating a particular product or service or sector, that it first try methods such as disclosure. So if we have a strong disclosure regime in place, could a consumer in that circumstance reasonably avoid the practice? In the context, say, of credit cards, thinking back again to the work that the Senate did in getting that bill passed, the judgment was that double-cycle billing was not a practice that a consumer could reasonably--with disclosure could reasonably understand, and so the Senate decided that that practice was a practice that should be banned. So the basic idea of this legislation is to say, let us try disclosure first. Let us see if there are ways to make disclosure work. Let us try and have robust disclosure. If disclosure can't work because the consumer can't reasonably shape his or her conduct to be responsible based on that disclosure because the information, the terms are so confusing that consumers can't get enough information to actually understand them, then it ought to think about other regulatory tools, and in doing that, it needs to consider the costs as well as the benefits.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","So certainly a very clear set of reasonable tests to be met, moving from disclosure forward.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Secretary Barr. I want to return to the issue that Senator Corker had raised with you just so that I understand it more clearly. As I understand the proposal, the new agency would, in fact, have authority and direction to create what are called plain-vanilla or basic products and services. Do I understand that to mean that in a number of different categories, the agency would decide what the basic vanilla product is, like the basic 30- year loan or the basic ARM and so forth?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The agency could decide to say a basket of loans is a standard basket of loans, so a 30-year fixed-rate loan and an ARM with straightforward pricing might be the standard loan or set of loans. And then consumers would have the opportunity to see what the costs of that loan were and compare it to the costs of, say, a pay option ARM.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","But conceivably, as we get more distinct and varied types of products, we could see more distinct and varied types of what we are calling plain-vanilla versions of those products and we could have a pretty long list or vast array of agency-established products, is that correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, the intent and purpose of the provision is not, precisely not to have a proliferation of product-level decisions at a micro level but a basic set of standards that people can use as a point of comparison in making their decisions in choosing which product or service that they want. They will have a standard, a comparative point to look across the sector, as we did essentially with respect to the mortgage market until quite recently.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","I guess my point is, where does it end? Theoretically, the agency could just create one vanilla product, a 30-year loan, or a 15-year loan, or what have you, but it seems to me that what I am understanding you to be saying is that that is not what is contemplated and that there is, in fact, going to be an agency-established product for more than just a 30-year loan, but for other types of products and services that are going to be marketed. Am I correct there?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, you can have the agency engage in this process in the mortgage sector. You might see it, say, in credit cards. I would think you would want to look at areas in which there is broad market participation, lots of consumers are involved, and there is a way of anchoring decision making in a comparable product. But I don't imagine it would be the primary tool of the new agency. It is an additional tool that it has, along with the other tools of disclosure and banning unfair and deceptive acts and practices.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","And am I correct that the proposal also contemplates that the consumer would be required to acknowledge in yet another notice or acknowledgment that they were offered these basic products as well as any other products that were offered?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Again, the agency has flexibility there, Senator. So it could, instead of--it could have a requirement that the consumer opt into an alternative product. It need not do it that way. There is flexibility built into the agency's structure so that it can choose that approach if it feels it is warranted under the circumstances.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","All right. Thank you. I would like to-- because of time, I want to shift gears very quickly here to the issue of whether it is wise to separate safety and soundness regulation from consumer protection. I am sure you are aware that a number of authorities have indicated that there's a great danger in doing so. I see a couple of problems. One, proliferation of regulatory agencies. I think we should be trying to consolidate and streamline our regulatory system rather than adding yet another regulatory layer. But also the fact that you could have inconsistent regulations between the safety and soundness regulators and the consumer protection regulators. And finally, the fact that the safety and soundness regulators or the prudential regulators will have access to information that could be very relevant to consumer protection and vice-versa. Why should we separate these two functions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you very much, Senator Crapo. I think that the key here is that in the past, we have had a system in which we had a joining of the safety and soundness function and the consumer protection function in the banking sector and then no supervision or examination at all in the nonbanking sector and I think we have seen the results of that. We have had a system that hasn't protected consumers and hasn't been good for the safety and soundness of banks. It is very hard, I think, to say that our current structure with respect to consumer protection is good for consumers. It is very hard to say that it is good for banks. I don't think we will see inconsistent approaches because the consumer regulator will have clear authority for the items that the consumer regulator has to do. The prudential supervisor has clear authority for what it has to do. And they each have to do their jobs. And third, with respect to information, there is a requirement of information sharing between the prudential supervisor and the consumer agency. The examiners are going to share examination reports. The prudential supervisor sits on the board of the consumer agency. The consumer agency and the prudential supervisor both sit on the Financial Services Oversight Council. So I do believe there will be quite good coordination.",Speech, 
"Senator Crapo","Well, thank you. I have heard that explanation before, the fact that it didn't happen before, therefore, we should change. I am not sure that that really is a good reason to separate those two functions, but thank you very much anyway.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Crapo, very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Secretary Barr, for being here. The proposal provides authority for the agency to collect annual fees or assessments. How do you see this impacting smaller financial institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator Tester. I believe that the new agency will be able to use existing fees that are collected for this purpose by the banking agencies----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","----and it will not increase the overall level of fees that are being collected in the system.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","So they are going to be pulling some of the fees they are already paying to pay for the regulation that already exists?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","So no increase in fees?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Well, under the legislation, there is broad authority for the agency. We don't anticipate that it would result in any increase in fees. It would likely result in a reduction in fees because the agency is consolidating functions across all the existing entities. There will be efficiencies of scale and scope in doing that.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","All right. How do you see the States fitting into the Consumer Financial Protection Agency?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The States would have a quite important role. States have been at the forefront in many ways of consumer protection. States would be able to enforce Federal law. States would have a strong role with respect to their own examination and supervision processes.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Would they be able to go beyond the Federal?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","And States would be able to set higher rules if they believe that the Federal standards weren't sufficient.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","All right. There can be debate on why we have regulation. I can tell you, safety and soundness and consumer protection, I mean, if you don't have--it is all consumer protection in the end, as far as I am concerned. I think that is fundamentally, from my perspective, why regulation is set up. You may disagree. But in your statement, and it is in the written statement and you verbalized it again, you talked about how screwed up the current system is, and I agree and I think everybody in this Committee understands that it is severely flawed right now. And I appreciate the Administration coming forward with their proposal. But the question is, does the proposal, this part of the proposal, other parts of the proposal, does it really fix the problem, because we do have a fragmented system and you can shop for regulators and all that stuff. Does it fix it?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","In our judgment, sir, it does. I think it would prevent the kind of regulatory arbitrage that we saw in the past.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","It sets high standards across the playing field that apply to everybody.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Correct me if I am wrong, but as far as consolidation of agencies so things don't fall through the cracks, the proposal is for the OCC and the OTS to be combined. Any others?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, sir. I think if you look across the range of the proposals that we put in place, we would merge the OCC and the OTS into a new national bank supervisor.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We would prevent kind of shopping for regulators by firms that are in enforcement trouble. We would eliminate all the exceptions to the Bank Holding Company Act, the loopholes in the past that have permitted firms to escape consolidated supervised regulation at the Federal level. We would remove the Fed Light restrictions from the Gramm-Leach- Bliley Act so that the Federal Reserve can act as a consolidated supervisor. And each of those measures is designed to ensure that the kind of regulatory arbitrage we saw on the prudential side does not occur in the future.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. One of the things that has concerned me and I have expressed in this Committee many times is that community banks, credit unions, for the most part, have been pretty good actors in this whole thing. They haven't created the problem. And yet when it gets down to the nuts and bolts of regulation, they are being clamped as much as the Wall Street bankers that I think in a lot of cases should be doing time for what they have done. So in this proposal, what can you tell me--Consumer Financial Protection Agency aside, what can you tell me that will make it so that this doesn't happen again or has a lot less possibility of happening again?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Tester, we have a very strong proposal in our report and will soon be sending up legislation with respect to consolidated supervision of very large financial firms, what are called under our proposal Tier 1 financial holding companies. They will be subject to stringent supervision on a consolidated basis. They will have higher capital standards. They will have higher requirements with respect to liquidity. And the basic goal of that system is to create large cushions in the system so that when failures happen, if failures happen, there is a lot more give----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Are we doing the same thing to the community banks that you just talked about to the Wall Street banks?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The communities are not getting extra requirements----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Are we requiring higher capital standards? Are we doing some of the other stuff you talked about? What I am hearing that is happening on the ground because of what the bad actors did above them, if you want to call them above them, is they are getting pinched on capital standards across the board.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Sir, I think I want to separate, Senator Tester, what may be happening in the field with respect to examination today and what the proposals are for the future, and under our legislative proposal, we are focusing on raising capital in the system and raising it even more so and higher with respect to Tier 1 financial holding companies so that any incentive to be large is taken away.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","All right. OK. Thank you very much. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Tester. Let me just comment here. I think Senator Tester has raised a good point. I think all of us would tell you up here, and I am sure you are aware of this, as well, that from our community bankers and, for the most part, the credit unions in our State acted very responsibly through all of this and what they worry about is being saddled with a lot of the cost that comes down. That will not be warmly received, I can tell you right now, just looking at it. We need to make that case over and over again. There is a distinction in performance. We have a tendency to talk about banks in a generic context and don't draw the distinctions between those who acted responsibly and those who didn't. And so as we look at these proposals and ideas, we ought to keep that very much in mind. I can just guarantee you, there will be no willingness up here to levy kind of additional fees and costs on the community banking system of the country that is feeling a lot of pressure already.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Absolutely, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Warner.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Secretary, for your testimony. Let me start by simply saying I concur that there have been failures in the systems and that we need to figure out how to do a better job on consumer protection. I do have some questions about the approach the Administration is taking. I want to go back to some of the comments that Senator Corker and Senator Merkley made. I am still struggling with kind of what the underlying theory here is. Is the underlying theory that the goal is enhanced disclosure in comparison, or as you raised, that there are times when disclosure in comparison may not be enough as was evidenced by the Fed's action on double-cycle billing? Take me through again what the basis is here. Are we going to look for some bright-line prohibitions or do we feel like a disclosure regime alone is enough?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator Warner. I think that in the first instance, we need an independent, single-focused mission Consumer Financial Protection Agency. So the first principle would be clear mission, clear accountability, clear responsibility by one agency. That agency will have different tools that it needs to use in different market contexts. Some of those tools--the bulk of those tools will be disclosure. Disclosure can often solve many of the problems in our financial services marketplace, because if you clearly disclose a product or services, then consumers can choose the product or service they want. That is the best answer in many circumstances. In some circumstances, you want that agency to do more. You want it, for example, to say to a consumer, not just here is the information about the transaction, but here is the consequence of this decision or that decision. So one of the things that this Committee and the Congress did in the credit card bill was say to credit card companies, you need to let consumers know how much it would cost them if they only paid the minimum on their credit card balance. That is an additional item beyond the traditional disclosure that in some contexts can make a big difference to consumers. In other contexts, you need a standard point of comparison to make that disclosure meaningful, so not just the pay-option ARM costs X, but that is what it costs in relation to, say, a standard 30-year mortgage or in the kinds of pay-option ARM, a 5-1 ARM with straightforward terms. So points of comparison can matter a lot, too. And then in the last instance, you have the ability to ban terms in products or services where they are unfair and deceptive and these other tools don't work.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But you would see this agency having that ability to ban certain products?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Again, as----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","In a preclearance way or after the product has already been out in the marketplace?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","There is no preclearance requirement under this legislation. It is not like other legislation the Committee may have considered in the past. There is no preclearance procedure with respect to all products and services. There is a requirement of disclosure.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But let us assume you have a product. It has been disclosed. You have got a comparison basis. In effect, the Federal agency has fostered that that is appropriate. But we are still allowing, then, the 50 independent Attorneys General to go out and raise the bar higher, correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes. So under the legislation, the traditional preemption by national banks would not be available and States could set higher rules for products and services. But with respect to the unfair acts and practices, the agency could step in and say, if you are offering a credit card with double-cycle billing, that is unfair. We can't disclose our way around it. So that particular term----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I guess what I just want to make sure I understand, you are saying that a product, that if the Federal agency had determined disclosure alone was enough, it then comes out into the marketplace and an Attorney General decides, no, disclosure is not enough. We want to actually ban this product in State X. They can go ahead and initiate that action, and if it is successful at a State level, what does the financial institution--there is no kind of pass, that once you have passed the disclosure requirement at the Federal level, that you have got an ability then to go into the marketplace and offer this because you can still have the State Attorney General raise a separate action, is that correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","No, sir. So the State Attorney General can only enforce State law that exists or Federal law that exists. If a State legislature decided to set a higher standard in a particular area, it would be free to do that as States are free in many areas of consumer life to set higher standards to that----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I know my time is up. Just one quick other comment. I am not sure I fully got your answer there, but I am interested in this area on the nonbank supervision, the question of going after financial products. Do you envision at some point the Administration coming forward on these noncurrently covered financial institutions? Are you going to look at their product mix underneath this legislation? Will you also envision at some point laying out some kind of safety and soundness oversight, prudential oversight, as well, for a series of nonbank financial institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Warner, this only applies to consumer financial protections. So in our proposal, consumer financial protection issues would be at this one agency and the consumer issues would be able to be examined across the financial services sector. But there is no proposal to have broad Federal prudential----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","No prudential regulation on the whole nonbank sector of the----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Not with respect to, say, an independent mortgage company. Certainly with respect to, if you are a--within a bank holding company, the Federal Reserve would have consolidated supervision of all the entities within a bank holding company and it would be required to ensure that all the elements of the holding company are not undermining safety and soundness. So in that respect, yes, but not a broad new authority with respect to prudential supervision outside the bank holding company context.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I hope we get another round.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Warner.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Barr, one of the objectives of the CFPA is to fill regulatory gaps, a goal I share. If a State does not examine a mortgage broker, would this agency? If a State does not examine a check casher, would this agency?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","The agency, Senator Johnson, would have the authority to set uniform rules to examine and supervise mortgage brokers. It could also do that with respect to other financial services providers, including check cashers, with a goal again of having high standards across the financial services marketplace and a level playing field for competition, so banks and community banks and credit unions are not at a competitive disadvantage.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","According to the draft bill submitted by the Administration, the CFPA would have the authority to oversee financial advisors who provide financial and other related advisory services. Since the bill appears to exclude from the CFPA's jurisdiction all products and services regulated by the SEC, the CFTC, and State insurance departments, will you please clarify who this language is intended to impact.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator. The basic language there is designed to deal with scams that have come up around the corners of the marketplace, where institutions that are not generally subject to any regulation offer what they call financial advice to consumers. It is primarily not aimed at State-regulated financial advisors, where there already is a system in place at the State level for regulating those institutions.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Could an unintended consequence of products be the consolidation of markets?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think, Senator Johnson, that we will see lots of financial innovation in the future, lots of choice in the future in financial products. This agency will enable choice cross the financial services sector, enable financial innovation across the financial services sector based on a level playing field with high standards.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","I can probably say that most mortgages are originated within the terms of 30-year fixed-rate mortgages. These products work for most of my constituents. That said, sometimes there are other products that are not plain vanilla that work for a consumer. Your proposal seems to create many hurdles for both banks that offer these types of products and consumers that use them. Do you think your proposal creates a disincentive for institutions to offer different products? Do you think that fewer products will reduce consumer choice? Could this indirectly increase the cost of credit?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator. Our judgment is that the new agency will have the ability to set high standard across the financial services marketplace, including for mortgages, that we will continue to see innovation in the mortgage sector, but that if firms want to offer products that are difficult for consumers to understand, there will be a higher burden on them to explain those products and services. And I think that we have seen the consequences of a system in which there is inadequate supervision of those kinds of practices. So I do think we are going to see a rebalancing, if you will, where it is a much lighter regulatory burden even than we have today with respect to straightforward products. So you can do things like combine the Truth in Lending Form and the Real Estate Settlement Practices Form into one simple Mortgage Disclosure Form everybody can use. That is easy under the new approach, very hard under the current approach. It is a way of reducing regulatory burden for banks, improving disclosure for consumers. We can see a lot of that happening in this space with the new agency.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","My time is up.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Mr. Barr, for your service. I know you guys have a lot on your plate over at Treasury, so I am grateful for your time this morning and your focus on this important issue. Can you outline for the Committee, what were some of the abuses that have been brought to light by the current crisis that this proposal intends to prevent?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Senator Bayh. I think one key area where we saw abuse was in mortgage broker conduct. We saw brokers who were offered incentives to get consumers to take out loans that were more costly than the ones they qualified for----",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","And you forgive me for interrupting you. I agree with that wholeheartedly. That has been fairly well documented. How about in areas beyond mortgage lending?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think, again, in the credit card context, this Committee has discussed problems with unfair practices in credit cards, problems we have seen with respect to bank overdraft fees, which are not disclosed as credit problems, problems in the payday lending sector, where there have been significant failings, problems in the auto loan sector, where disclosures have been inadequate and abuses have occurred. I think if you look really across the consumer financial services marketplace, at credit products, at payment products, and the like, bank products, there have been a series of failures of our existing regime to take account of the needs of consumers. And I am sure you hear the complaints from your constituents on these matters.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Certainly in the credit card area we did, and that is one of the reasons the Committee and the Congress acted in that area. So it is your judgment, Mr. Barr--and I agree with your assessment of many of the practices you have outlined there--it is your judgment that the problem can't be addressed by simply proscribing some of those things or tightening existing enforcement and regulation to prevent a recurrence or to require greater disclosure in the future?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","That is our judgment, sir. I think if you look across the history of this matter, we don't want to fix one problem only to ignore and miss the next problem. We need an agency that is looking out for consumers all the time.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Let me ask you about the responsibility that consumers have, because an enlightened, vigilant consumer is really their best protection. It is hard to regulate against all these sorts of things. So what responsibilities do consumers bear under this regime?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think consumers bear the responsibility to act responsibly based on the best information they have, and it is the job of the financial services industry to compete based on price and quality and not based on confusing consumers. But in our current system, the incentives to have hidden features are very large. We have seen that across the financial services marketplace. And so if you have an agency that can set rules of the road, everybody can compete based on transparent pricing and services. Consumers win. Financial services firms win. It is good for the economy. It is good for the country. So that is the kind of system we want to see going forward.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Several of my colleagues have touched upon the importance of disclosure, and you have touched upon the importance of prohibiting abusive practices. I think we all agree on that. But disclosure only works if consumers do their part, too, and that is why I asked the question. We need to build in incentives for them to actually take advantage of the information that is being offered, process it, and then bear some responsibility for their own outcome, because if there is not some responsibility on the individual, the system is not going to work too well.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think that is absolutely right. Consumers need to behave responsibly and we need to make the path available to them to do so.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Barr.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and we appreciate your being here, Under Secretary Barr. Sorry I couldn't be here the whole time. We have the Judiciary hearings. That is why I am in the back here. But I am very much for a Consumer Financial Protection Agency. In fact, Senator Durbin, Senator Kennedy, and I introduced legislation quite along the lines of this a while back and I am glad that the Chairman has made this an important hearing, an important part of our bill, and I am glad that the White House has supported it. The bottom line is that the present regulatory structure has been an abject failure. I worked with the Fed on, for instance, credit card interest rates for 15 years. The progress was slow, it was muted, and way behind what the credit card issuers would come out with. And so to have an agency whose sole focus is on protecting consumers when the Fed has so many other responsibilities, and we are considering giving them even more responsibility, makes sense. Having the FTC do it, again, they are all across the board. And look, let us face it, the kinds of deceptive practices that, for instance, occurred in the mortgage industry brought down the whole economy, and it is amazing to me that people say we don't need stronger regulation given that that has happened. It is just amazing. And as for this idea, and I want to ask you about this, stifling innovation--some of the critics have said this--yes, it will. It will stifle innovation, clever ways to dupe the consumer, to sell people mortgages that they shouldn't have, to issue people more credit card debt than they can pay for. You bet, it is going to stifle that kind of innovation. But will it stifle a new product, as long as it is fully disclosed, that the consumer or mortgagor needs? No. So please, we have had such a sorry history in the regulation of consumer financial products--sorry history, despite the efforts of you, Mr. Chairman, and others on this Committee on both sides of the aisle--that I would argue that if we don't include this in our financial regulation bill, there will be a gaping hole. But I want to ask you the question about innovation, Mr. Barr. What about the argument that this new agency will stifle innovation of new products and things?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Schumer, I think that the agency will enable financial innovation to occur based on a level playing field with high standards. It will prevent the kind of competition that we have seen in the past based on--competition based on who can provide the most confusing terms and the most hidden fees.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","But competition based on financial innovation for price and quality, transparency to consumers, that kind of financial innovation we will see more of, not less.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Right. Let me ask you this. What about the FTC? Some have said, well, the FTC can do these kinds of things. Has the FTC done at all a decent job in regulating financial products in the last decade?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator, I think that the FTC is a good agency with many good people in it. I think that it has not had the tools to do this kind of action. It is structurally not set up to supervise or examine the nonbank sector. It can only act long after the fact with enforcement when it is too late----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","and that is just not enough. It can't act at all with respect to banks, and so we have a fractured system where everybody can point fingers and nobody gets the job done.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Right. And let me just ask one more question of you, and that is this. Right now, one of the things that hamstrung us was the fact that there were unregulated areas. In other words, if a bank issued a mortgage, there was some degree of regulation--I would say not enough, but some. But if a mortgage broker got from a nonbank financial institution financing, there was virtually no regulation at the Federal level, and when you talked to the Fed about it, which I did, they would say, well, we don't have jurisdiction. Isn't another reason to have this financial product regulator, which regulates the product and not the specific institution that issues the product, a way when the next new innovation comes up that there won't be a hole in the regulatory structure, because right now, we regulate by the type of institution, not the type of product issued?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Schumer, that is exactly right. This institution, this new agency will have the authority to examine and supervise any financial institution. It won't be limited to banks. It won't be limited to nonbanks. It can supervise and examine and set rules across the financial services industry. So if you are a community bank and a credit union, you are not going to be put in a place of competing with an unregulated mortgage company ever again.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","It will, as you say, create a level playing field across the board based on the product. I thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Schumer, thank you very much. Senator Shelby has a comment he wants to make. I know Bob had a quick question. I am trying to get to the second panel if we can, as well, so I don't want to limit my colleagues here who want to raise another question or two here, but I do want to get to the second panel.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will try to be fast. I do have a number of questions for the Secretary that I would like to be made part of the record.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","And I have, as well, and I will submit those for the record.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Secretary, you were one of the authors, and we have talked about this this morning, of the article that appeared, published by the New American Foundation, ``Behaviorally Informed Financial Service Regulation,'' right?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, sir.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","OK. Among other things in that article, I just want to quote from this, and this will be as quickly as I can say. It says, ``We explore a different approach based on insights from behavioral economics on the one hand and an understanding of individual organization on the other. At the core of our analysis is the interaction between individual psychology and market competition. This is in contrast to the classic model, which relies on the interaction between rational choice and market competition. In the classic model, absent market failures, because rational agents choose well, firms compete to provide products and improve welfare. Because rational agents process information well, firms compete to provide information that improves decision quality. ``By contrast, in our model,'' and some of this is in this proposal, as I understand it, ``individuals depart from neoclassical assumptions in important ways. The introduction of richer psychology complicates the impact of competition. Now firms compete based on how actual individuals will respond to products in the marketplace and actual competitive outcomes may not always and in all contexts closely align with the improved decisional choice and increase consumer welfare.'' This is a real departure from, as you said in your paper, from the model that we have relied on for a long time. I am not saying that model is pure and perfect, because it is not, but this is a heck of a departure, is it not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","And, Senator Shelby, in that article, we are highlighting different models of thinking about human decision making----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Sure.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","and in most circumstances, competitive outcomes are going to lead to welfare enhancement. But in some circumstances where individuals are consistently prone to failure, it won't, and then the question is should the Government do something about that. Many times, the answer is no. It is sort of a trivial difference in outcomes. It would cost more to get engaged than it would to not get engaged and so you want the Government to do nothing. In some contexts, though, the failures are so deep that you think some kind of step needs to happen, whether that is through disclosure or through providing information about the consequences of financial decision making, or in some particular circumstances saying a particular term should be banned, as this Committee did with respect to double-cycle billing.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I understand, I think, where you are going, or trying to go. I hope you don't go too far here, or we don't. But on the other hand, an informed consumer--an informed consumer--that has relevant information will generally make a rational decision in the marketplace.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","I think that is absolutely right. So I think that in most circumstances, most of the time, disclosure is going to get you most of the way there. And then the question is, in what context is that not enough? And again, as the Committee did with respect to credit cards, some practices you can't disclosure your way around. They are too complicated. Consumers can't--a responsible consumer trying to do the right thing couldn't actually figure out how to behave responsibly in that context.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Wait a minute. But you are really saying that you don't trust the consumer to make decisions for themselves, in a sense.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","No, I think consumers are--I trust consumers tremendously. What I don't trust is that if we set up the marketplace so that the incentives are to confuse consumers, that is the kind of competition we will get. We will get competition around confusing consumers. If we set up the marketplace so the rules are you compete to get consumers to your product because you have a better product, that is the marketplace we will get.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","But according to Senator Corker's question, as I understood it earlier, you are going to ration the products that you can offer.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","No, sir. There would be no product rationing under this----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","You are not going to ration----",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","No product rationing under this approach at all. Consumer choice, individual freedom are at the heart of this. The key provisions of this Act would enhance the ability of consumers to make decisions that make sense for their own lives.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Well, I hope we are going to have a lot of hearings on this, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Jack, you have a question you would like to raise?",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Secretary Barr. Can you walk through how the proposal establishes primary and secondary enforcement, rulemaking, and examination responsibilities?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Yes, Senator Reed. A core principle of our proposal is that supervision, examination, and rule writing should be joined together with respect to banks and nonbank institutions so there can be uniform rules of the road, real supervision and enforcement across the financial services sector. We leave backstop authority at the bank agencies and at the FTC in case something falls through the cracks, in case something gets picked up in an exam and they need to refer it over to the new agency. But the idea is not to have any duplication, to have real core focus on consumer issues in one place with real responsibility and accountability to the Congress and the American people.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Can you comment about the alternative approach which some have suggested, which is essentially the bank regulators take the lead and then the CFPA would be sort of the backup?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Senator Reed, I think we have seen a system in the past where rule writing was at the Federal Reserve and supervision was spread around in the bank agencies and the system was fundamentally broken. The rule writer had a conflicting mission. The supervisory entities had conflicting missions. None of them thought consumer protection was at the top of what they would do. They would regulate banks based on reputation risk and litigation risk with respect to consumer issues, looking out for the interest of the bank and not consumers. I think we can't have that approach going forward.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Let me raise another issue and that is the funding. Your proposal, how would the CFPA be funded?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","We look forward to working with the Congress on determining the right approach to funding issues. I know that is an area of great concern to the Congress. We need to ensure that the funding is stable and strong. Under our approach, there would be a mix of appropriated funds as well as the transfer of fees from the bank regulatory agencies with respect to consumer protection functions and fees in the area where such fees have not been collected in the past in the nonbanking sector. So we have a mix of appropriations and fees funding the agency. We would be happy to work with the Congress on that approach.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Secretary, a final question. There is at present the tension in the banking regulators between safety and soundness and consumer protection. Some would argue that consumer protection was always subservient to that, and that led--was one of the factors that led. How in this new approach do we balance the safety and soundness issue with the regulators who are responsible for it and the consumer protection issues?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Each agency would have responsibility for the mission assigned to it. The consumer protection agency would need to be sure that, say, disclosures are clear about a product or service, and the bank supervisory agency would have authority with respect to prudential supervision, underwriting standards, capital requirements, sort of core prudential supervisory matters. So a clear assignment of authority, clear assignment of responsibility and accountability to the Congress and to the American people for achieving those aims.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much. Bob, did you have a quick question on this?",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Out of respect for everybody's time and knowing you want to move on, instead of asking questions, I will just make one statement. You have not alluded to student loans, auto loans. I know we have talked about mortgages. All of those are areas under your proposed legislation that you all would set up basic products. And while I said not necessarily on the front end, I just want to say, in listening to your testimony and answers, this is an example of all examples of this Administration being Big Brother, and I think the American people are recoiling from this. I think this is a tremendous overreach and very disturbing to listen to. I hope that as you move along, we will be able to work together to do something that is not an overreach, where the Federal Government is telling citizens the types of products they should and shouldn't buy, and telling companies what they should and shouldn't offer. This is way out of bounds and I look forward to working with you to get it in bounds.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Warner, do you have a quick question?",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I just want to make sure we try to get it right and I have still got a series of questions, but I will reserve those until another time.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I thank my colleagues. Let me just say, that is our intention, obviously, to get this right. I think your testimony has been very valuable this morning. Maybe Senator Schumer hit the note in a way. We don't want to forget what has happened over the last several years. It is unprecedented. You have got to go back to the generation of our grandparents to talk about a time similar to the ones we have been through. We have got 15 million homes underwater today--15 million--and every likelihood of those foreclosures continuing at a rate that is unprecedented, certainly in modern times, and the obvious implications of that are spread far beyond just home mortgages to other aspects of our economy. And so the notion--when we lost sight of the--three great things done by the Depression Era Congress and Administrations were the establishment of the Securities and Exchange Commission, the establishment of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and Glass-Steagall, in my view. Those three things gave us virtually 60 years almost of unprecedented stability. When we began to wander away from having oversight of our financial institutions, we began to mix commerce and banking to the point where we thought we were going to have firewalls to protect people but did not do so, as well as not having adequate insurance under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. We began to see the problems, and I can point to other aspects to all of this. And so getting back to the notion that when that consumer-- and the consumer, in my view, is the shareholder, it is the policy holder on an insurance policy, it is the borrower whether it is a mortgage or a car loan or a student loan--when we lose sight of that individual, if we don't take into view that individual's concerns and begin to look just top-down and not bottom-up, then you begin to lose sight of what this is all about to people. These are highly complicated areas. Now, I think the issues raised about mandating or dictating or somehow driving certain product lines is something that we have got to be careful how we engage in that. Bob Corker has raised an interesting point and one that we ought to examine thoroughly. But the idea that we are going to have sort of disregard for what is going on, too often, in too many cases is where consumer issues have been lost in this process here. The idea that when people walk in and they are being marketed--60 percent--according to the Wall Street Journal, 60 percent of the subprime mortgages went to people who otherwise qualified for a conventional mortgage, a lot cheaper product than that subprime mortgage. That is an outrage. That is people marketing products that they knew very well that that borrower could not afford, never at the fully indexed rate, and were going to be in trouble. And having a process which protects people against that kind of behavior, I think is critical. Now, how we do this and shake this up obviously is a challenge to the Committee, working with the Administration and others. But my view is we have got to take this issue on and find a mechanism here that certainly fills that gap that has existed for far too long and created for the first time in 60 years the kind of break that occurred that we are all struggling with today. So I appreciate your testimony. We will have additional questions for you to submit, but I want to get to the second panel here if we can, very quickly.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, can I have one word?",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","One word.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","If I could, maybe one or two. We appreciate you coming here today, but even you admit in your studies, and this is an outgrowth of some of those studies, that this is a radical departure from the way we have regulated things before. We have tried to let the market work, let the consumer, an informed consumer, make decisions, not a bureaucrat make the decisions. And there are a lot of flaws in these proposals and that is why we are holding hearings, political and otherwise. But to move away fast and furious from a classical model of regulation, we had better be really careful. What we ultimately will do probably is really ration credit to people who need it the most.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just say, and then we will give you a chance to quickly respond, we have been faced with a radical situation in our country. This is unprecedented. I respect that the classical model has fallen apart and the people who have paid the price for it are consumers. That home owner or that potential home owner, that person out there today who is losing their home, they are losing their jobs, they are losing their retirement, they are losing their health care, to them, this is pretty radical. This is not an abstract problem for them, it is a real one. And when you get 10,000 people a day losing their homes and 20,000 people a day losing their jobs, that is radical, believe me. And so I am not looking for radical solutions here that don't meet the problem. But if we don't understand the depth of this problem, the anger of the people of this country of what they are going through and the demand that we start paying attention to what happens to them every single day they walk into an institution to borrow money, to buy a policy, to invest in a corporation because they want to increase their stability, then we are losing something here. So we need to get this right. Do you have any comments you want to make quickly as we end up?",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The Administration's proposal would represent a fundamental break from the past. I think it is clear that our system of financial regulation failed the American people and we need to have a new foundation, a firm foundation that protects consumers, and that is what this proposal does. Thank you very much to you, Mr. Chairman, to Mr. Shelby, and to the Committee as a whole for hearing from me.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","We will stay in touch. As Bob Corker said and others said, we want to work with you. We have got a lot of work to do, but we appreciate you being here.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","A lot of work.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Very good.",Speech, 
"Mr. Barr","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me go to our second panel, and we appreciate their patience, but I hope it has been worthwhile to be here with us. The introductions are going to be brief, so I don't have long introductions. Let me first of all introduce my Attorney General. Dick Blumenthal is here with us. Richard has been our Attorney General for a long time and done a fabulous job, served in the Connecticut House of Representatives, the State Senate, a Sergeant in the U.S. Marine Corps Reserves, distinguished record, and I think the greatest Attorney General in the United States of America. I say that every time I get to introduce him. He does a great job. Ed Yingling is an old friend and a person we respect immensely. Ed is the President and CEO of the American Bankers Association. All of us here have worked with Ed Yingling for many, many years and have a high regard for him and his abilities. Travis Plunkett is the Legislative Director for the Consumer Federation of America and has appeared before this Committee on numerous occasions involving any number of issues, most recently on the credit card efforts, and I want to thank publicly Travis and the Consumer Federation of America for the tremendous job they did in promoting and advocating the legislative success we had with the credit card bill. Peter Wallison, I have already drawn into the debate, having quoted from his testimony, but we thank you very much, Peter. I hope you didn't mind me mentioning your quote on CRA. Peter is the Arthur F. Burns Fellow in Financial Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. I often quote Arthur Burns about the race to the bottom, he used to talk about, in regulatory processes. And Mr. Sendhil Mullainathan is a Professor of Economics at Harvard University, and we thank you very much, Professor, for being with us. Let me begin with the Attorney General and thank him for his testimony in advance and for your incredible career of public service to our State and the country.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","Thank you, Senator. I am very, very honored by those kind words, especially from someone who has led consumer protection efforts in the country, most recently in the credit reform bill, and I want to thank you very sincerely for all that you have done in other areas of consumer protection and the leadership that you will no doubt provide the Committee in this area, which as you have said marks what seems to be a radical departure from past practices in a time that demands radical solutions. It is a fundamental break with the past that is very well justified by recent history. This proposal would create a new agency, a very strong financial products watchdog and guardian, similar to the one that now exists at the Federal level in the Federal Trade Commission for other kinds of products, the Consumer Product Safety Commission for certain kinds of other goods and services, and essentially would restore the historic State-Federal alliance that existed for so many years so productively in combating financial fraud and abuse. This financial State partnership was riven and destroyed by excessive resort to Federal preemption, which displaced State enforcement and replaced that collegiality between Federal and State officials with conflict and tension that need not have existed. In fact, that conflict was one of the reasons why we saw the kinds of abuses that led to the financial meltdown. That meltdown was foreseeable. Indeed, it was foreseen. I used the word ``regulatory black hole'' to characterize hedge funds and many of the other inventive and innovative financial instruments that very few people understood even as they used them, and the excessive risk taking, often with other people's money, that was enabled by that regulatory black hole. And so I think that the genius of this proposal, or its great advantage, is to restore the alliance between consumer protectors at the Federal and State level. The doctrine of Federal preemption has essentially led to the Federal Government abandoning the battlefield and then foreclosing the States from fighting on that battlefield. It has in so many areas prevented States, in fact, in many of those same areas that Secretary Barr answered to Senator Warner's question--payday loans, tax preparer anticipation refund loans, credit card issues, mortgage abuses--and I describe in my testimony--I am not going to read the testimony but just briefly say that in many of those areas where these abuses developed, our opponent was most frequently the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency. I litigated more against the OCC than I did against any other single institution. And the most recent Supreme Court decision, Cuomo v. Clearinghouse Association, which restores some of our authority under the National Bank Act, was really against the OCC. And so it isn't only that Federal authority has been fragmented, that the culture has been wanting, that the FTC has lacked the tools and resources, it is the hostility, the overt antagonism and adversarial posture of the Federal Government as against the States in consumer protection. And if it does nothing else--and it does a lot else--this proposal will help restore that alliance between State Attorneys General and the Federal Government. I believe very strongly that this proposal is a good idea. There are details, as many Senators have already remarked, that need to be refined and perhaps changed. But in concept, the idea of having one central point accountable, fully accountable to those consumers out there who don't know where to call--and right now call my office--is a very, very important concept. The accountability to this body of the Consumer Financial Products Commission or Agency will be a tremendous advantage. And let me just close by saying I couldn't agree more, based on 18 years as Attorney General, that consumers ultimately have to be their own protectors. But anybody who right now reads most of these documents, and I am trained to read them, will find them extraordinarily perplexing and confusing, not just in the fine print but in their concepts. And so this agency, as job number one, ought to not only fill that regulatory black hole, but provide for clear, truthful, accurate disclosure, and that is one of the essential missions that has been completely absent. I agree completely that the prudential responsibilities of the Fed and other existing agencies probably conflict, or at least create divided loyalties so far as consumer protection is concerned, another reason why we can't use either the FTC or the Federal Reserve to carry these important responsibilities, because consumer protection, especially in disclosure, is a mission that really requires, in financial products, a separate and distinct agency that has that accountability and will replace the current culture, the current mindset of conflict with the States and resistance to aggressive and vigorous consumer protection.

"Mr. Yingling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your introduction. It may be my high-water mark this morning, but I really appreciate it. Thank you, Senator Shelby and Members of the Committee. It would be expected that your Committee would look at this proposal from the point of view of consumers, who should be paramount in your consideration. However, the ABA believes that this proposal is not, unfortunately, the best approach for consumers and will actually undermine consumer choice, competition, and the availability of credit. But I would also ask you to look at this issue from an additional point of view. While banks of all sizes would be negatively impacted, think of your local community banks and credit unions, for that matter. These banks never made one subprime loan, yet these community banks have found the Administration proposing a potentially massive new regulatory burden. While the shadow banking industry, which includes those most responsible for the crisis, is covered by the new agency, their regulatory and enforcement burden is, based on history, likely to be much less. The proposed new agency will rely first on State enforcement, and yet we all know that the budgets for such State enforcement are completely inadequate to do the job. Therefore, innocent community banks will have greatly increased fees to fund a system that falls disproportionately and unfairly on them. The agency would have vast and unprecedented authority to regulate in detail all bank consumer products. The agency is even instructed to create its own products and mandate that banks offer them. And Senator Corker, this is the part that was missing from your discussion with the Secretary. The agency is urged to give the products it designs regulatory preference over the bank's own products. The agency is even encouraged to require a statement by the consumer acknowledging that the consumer was offered and turned down the Government's product first, and every nongovernment product would be subject to more regulation than the Government product. Community banks, whether it fits their business model or not, would be required to offer Government-designed products, which would be given preference over their own products. On disclosure, the proposal goes beyond simplification, which is needed, to require that all bank communication with consumers be, quote, ``reasonable.'' This is a term that is so vague that no banker and no lawyer would know what to do with it. But not to worry. The proposal offers to allow thousands of banks and thousands of nonbanks to preclear communications with the agency. So before a community bank runs an ad in the local newspaper or sends a customer a letter, it would need to preclear it with the new agency. All this cost, regulation, conflicting requirements, and uncertainty would be placed on community banks that in no way contributed to the crisis. The fundamental flaw in the proposal is that consumer regulation and safety and soundness regulation are two sides of the same coin. You cannot separate a business from its products. The simple example is check-hold periods. Customers would like the shortest possible hold, but this desire needs to be balanced with complex operational issues in check clearing and with the threat of fraud, which costs banks and ultimately consumers billions of dollars. The breadth of this proposal is, in many respects, shocking. Every financial consumer law Congress has ever enacted and every existing regulation is rendered to a large degree moot, mere floors. No one will know for years what the new rules are and what they mean. When developing products and making loans, providers must rely on legal rules of the road, but now everything will be changed, subject to vast and vague powers of this new agency and anything States may want to add. This problem is exacerbated by the use of new, untested terminology, again such as the requirement that disclosures be reasonable, whatever that means, which will take years to be defined in regulation and court decisions. If industry has no idea what the rules will be, what the terms will mean, and how broad legal liability will be, there is no doubt what will happen. Innovative products will be put on the shelf and credit will be less available. We agree that improvements need to be made. The great majority of the problems occurred outside the highly regulated traditional banks, but there are legitimate issues relating to banks, as well. We want to work with Congress to address these concerns and implement improvements, and in that regard, my written testimony outlines concepts that should be considered. I do want to put one fact back on the table that Secretary Barr referred to, and that is as we look at this and as we look at preemption, as we look at where the problems were, 94--this is the Administration's own numbers--94 percent of the high- cost mortgages occurred outside the traditional banking industry in areas that are either unregulated, lightly regulated, or in theory supposed to be regulated at the State level. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Senator Reed . Thank you, Mr. Yingling. Mr. Plunkett, please.",Statement,STATEMENT OF EDWARD L. YINGLING, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION 
"Mr. Plunkett","Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, Members of the Committee, it is good to be back with you. I am testifying today on behalf of the Consumer Federation of America and 23 consumer, community, civil rights, and labor organizations. We strongly support the Administration's proposal to create a Federal Consumer Protection Agency focused on credit, banking, and payment products because it targets the most significant underlying causes of the massive regulatory failures that have led to harm for millions of Americans. First, agencies did not make protecting consumers from lending abuses a priority. In fact, they appeared to compete against each other to keep standards low and reduce oversight of financial institutions, ignoring many festering problems that grew worse over time. If they did act, and they often didn't, the process was cumbersome and time consuming. As a result, they did not stop abusive lending practices in many cases until it was too late. Finally, regulators were not truly independent of the influence of the financial institutions they regulated. The extent and impact of these regulatory failures is breathtaking. I offer 10 pages of detail on 12 separate regulatory collapses in my testimony over the last decade that have harmed consumers and increased their financial vulnerability in the middle of a deep recession. This involves not just the well-known blunders that we have heard about on mortgage lending and credit card lending. I also offer lesser- known but quite damaging cases of regulatory inaction, such as the failure of regulators to stop banks from offering extremely high-cost overdraft loans without consumer consent, the permission that Internet payday lenders have gotten from regulators to exploit gaps in Federal law, and the fact that regulators have not stopped banks that impose unlawful freezes on accounts containing Social Security and other protected funds. Meanwhile, the situation for consumers keeps getting worse as a result of these regulatory failures and the economic problems in our country. One in two consumers who get payday loans default within the first year. Mortgage defaults and credit card charge-offs are at record levels. Personal bankruptcies have increased sharply, up by one-third in the last year. Combining safety and soundness supervision with its focus on bank profitability in the same institutions, regulatory institutions, as consumer protection magnified an ideological predisposition or antiregulatory bias by Federal officials that led to unwillingness to rein in abusive lending before it triggered the housing and economic crisis. But we now know that effective consumer protection leads to effective safety and soundness. Structural flaws in the Federal regulatory system compromised the independence of banking regulators and encouraged them to overlook, ignore, and minimize their mission to protect consumers. The Administration's proposal would correct these structural flaws. Key facets of this proposal include streamlining the Federal bureaucracy by consolidating consumer protection rulemaking for seven different agencies in almost 20 statutes; providing the agency with authority to address unfair, abusive, and deceptive practices; ensuring that agency rules would be a floor and not a ceiling and that States could exceed and enforce these standards. In response to this far-sighted proposal, the financial services industry has launched an elaborate defense of the status quo by minimizing the harm that the current disclosure- only regime has caused Americans, making the usual threats that improving consumer protection will increase costs and impede access to credit, and offering recommendations for reform that barely tinker with the existing failed regulatory regime. These critics are hoping that this Committee will overlook the fact that the deregulatory regime that they championed and largely controlled has allowed deceptive, unsustainable, and abusive loan products to flourish, which has helped cause an economic crisis and a credit crunch. In other words, the regulatory system that creditors helped create has not only led to direct financial harm for millions of vulnerable Americans, but it has reduced their access to and increased their costs on the credit they are offered. Only a substantial restructuring of the regulatory apparatus through the creation of this kind of agency offers the possibility of meaningful improvement for consumers in the credit markets. The agency will be charged with spurring fair practices, transparency, and positive innovation in the credit markets, which should lead to a vibrant, competitive credit marketplace for many years to come. We strongly urge the Committee to support this proposal. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF TRAVIS B. PLUNKETT, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Plunkett. Mr. Wallison, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Thank you, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Shelby, Members of the Committee. I must say candidly that I was shocked when I realized how this legislation will actually work. For me, it raised the following questions. Are consumers protected when they cannot buy products and services that are available to others? Is that what consumers want? Does it matter what they want? These questions occur because the Administration's proposal for a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, the CFPA, results in the Government, I believe, essentially deciding which Americans will have access to certain financial products and which will not. Traditionally, consumer protection in the United States has focused on disclosure. It has always been assumed that with adequate disclosure, all consumers at whatever level of education or sophistication could make rational purchase decisions. Consumer protection under these circumstances focused on fraud and deception and could take account of differences in consumer sophistication. But the Administration's plan is based on an entirely different idea. That idea is that many consumers should not be allowed to have particular products or services because they are not sophisticated, educated, and perhaps intelligent enough to understand what they have been offered. It is clear that in the Administration's plan, disclosure, no matter how complete, is not enough. The white paper that the Administration circulated before submitting its legislation contains the following language: ``Even if disclosures are fully tested and all communications are properly balanced, product complexity itself can lead consumers to make costly errors.'' As a result, under the proposed legislation, every provider of a financial service, and that term, incidentally, includes everything from banks to check cashing services, and from furniture rental companies to Western Union, every one of these institutions--not including, incidentally, securities firms or insurance companies, which are also involved in financial activity--is required to offer a plain-vanilla product or service to be defined and approved by the CFPA that will be simpler and entail, ``lower risks'' for consumers. This raises, to me, the obvious question. Once the CFPA has prescribed a simpler and lower-risk mortgage, who will be eligible to buy the more complex product that is tailored to a consumer's particular needs? In effect, this question places on the provider the burden of deciding which of his customers is qualified for the more complex or riskier product. Going beyond the plain-vanilla product will entail risks for the provider, who could face an enforcement proceeding and a fine from the CFPA, action by a State Attorney General or a State Consumer Protection Agency also to enforce the CFPA's regulations, and a class action by disgruntled consumers who claim they did not understand the risks associated with the nonplain-vanilla product. As the white paper states, the CFPA should be authorized to use a variety of measures to help ensure that nonplain-vanilla mortgages were obtained only by consumers who understood the risks and could manage them. How would a provider determine whether a product with more features than the plain-vanilla product is suitable for a particular consumer? The white paper suggests that the CFPA could, ``require providers to have applicants fill out financial experience questionnaires.'' This will be a humiliating experience for anyone, especially a consumer whose credit record up to that point has been completely unblemished. It is not a question of what he can afford, but what he can understand, a much more difficult question. These elements are troubling enough, but this regime will be bad for all consumers. Product innovation will be stymied. Product variety will be diminished. Costs of credit will rise, and many small credit providers, small stores, finance companies, and others will have to leave the market. This will reduce competition and in some cases eliminate the only sources of credit for some consumers. So those who will be able to get these more complex plain- vanilla products--more products than are plain vanilla--who are these people? Not ordinary Americans, in my view, whose lack of demonstrable financial sophistication will make the risks of selling to them very difficult for most providers. The more complex products, the ones with useful features, will be offered only to the more sophisticated and the better educated, in other words, to the Nation's elites. In this way and for the first time in our history, it will be Government policy to deny products and services to a large proportion of the population, not because the products and services are inherently dangerous, like drugs or explosives, but because this Administration apparently believes that no amount of disclosure can make some Americans capable of understanding what they are buying. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF PETER WALLISON, ARTHUR F. BURNS FELLOW, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Wallison. Professor.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mullainathan","Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, thank you for providing me with an opportunity to testify. As an academic, my comments will lay out some of the ideas and research behind consumer protection. By way of background, my area of expertise is behavioral economics. It combines economists' healthy respect for markets with psychologists' recognition that people are not financial engines churning out optimal decisions. I will focus on making three points. First, the quality of choice is a result of the context in which we choose. Some contexts--many contexts allow people to choose well, but others do not. Second, when people choose well, markets work very well. They provide healthy competition. But when people choose badly, they can race to the bottom. Third, one tool in the proposed legislation, ring fencing so-called ``standard products,'' provides a way to promote competition and prevent this race to the bottom. So let me start with the psychology of choice. I am going to try and use two examples that are pretty familiar to all of you to illustrate decades of psychological research on how people actually choose. I want you to think back to the last time you painted a room in your house. You have thousands of colors to choose from. Benjamin Moore alone offers 140 shades of white. Yet, you sifted through this explosion of options and were probably happy with your final choice. Contrast this with the last time you bought an electronic device, such as a digital camera. How do you choose between a smaller, cheaper 8-megapixel camera and a bigger, more expensive 12-megapixel camera? What is a megapixel? How many do you need? Are 12 megapixels 50 percent more than 8 megapixels? At the end of this process, you probably weren't really sure whether you bought the right camera. The distinction here is that choosing between things you don't understand--megapixels is very different from choosing between things you do understand--color. Part of choosing a mortgage is like picking a color. What monthly payment fits within your budget? Part of choosing a mortgage, however, is like choosing a megapixel. How do you choose between a fixed-rate mortgage at $1,000 a month and one that begins at $900 a month but after 2 years changes to three points above the 1-year LIBOR? What does LIBOR mean? How much does it vary? Is three points above it reasonable? The provider says, ``Hey, you can refinance this mortgage in 2 years.'' Should you worry about being able to get another loan in 2 years? Note, this has nothing to do with elites or intellectuals. This is true for all people. These features of the difficulty of choice are the challenges of being human in choice context that are really not your area of expertise. The problem is not disclosure alone, it is about understanding. Sometimes disclosure produces understanding, but sometimes it does not. Financial technicalities simply do not resonate with the concepts you use in everyday life. As a result, errors abound. For example, a recent study shows that 40 percent of borrowers with income less than $50,000 do not know the per period caps on their ARMs. It wouldn't surprise me if, like megapixels, they barely understood what a pro period cap is. Why should they? Now let me turn to competition. As I pointed out, when people choose well, low road firms with short time horizons cannot do much harm. The best they can do is offer a product the consumer likes. In this case, markets work well and innovation helps consumers. However, when people are choosing badly, low road firms can confound both the consumer and high road firms. Next to the $1,000 fixed-rate mortgage, the $900 balloon ARM has a superficial appeal. It is cheaper today. Nine-hundred is smaller than $1,000. Its risks down the road are harder to understand. The worse product can look like the better product. The high road firm can be pulled down by the low road option. Now to my final point. I feel one powerful tool in the proposed legislation can be particularly useful in preventing the race to the bottom. Ring fence the standard, well- understood products and the more exotic ones. Regulate the standard ones minimally, ensure disclosure, prevent fraud, but regulate the more exotic ones stringently. The goal of this regulation should be to ensure that customers understand not just that the risks of these products be mechanically disclosed. Marketing can be endlessly inventive in sidestepping disclosure. The Consumer Financial Protection Agency needs stronger tools for products beyond the fence. Ring fencing, though, is far more market friendly than a banner or mandate. It retains customers' ability to access exotic products. The CFPA would simply ensure that there is a door on the fence that requires conscious choice to go through. No one should unknowingly end up on the other side of the fence. There are several precedents for this approach. I do not think this is the first time in American history this has happened. In fact, the SEC uses it as a way to regulate the trading of options and derivatives. If any of you would like to see this, try and buy an option. The Federal Reserve in July of 2008 placed some mortgages under far greater scrutiny. It is also analogous to how we regulate drugs. If you want to buy ibuprofen, you simply go and buy it. If you like a strong antibiotic, there are more barriers in place. Ring fencing, however, requires a variety of things to work. First, there must be sufficient choice within the fence. This cannot be a one-size-fits-all solution. The goal of this is to maximize choice. It is not to create standard products designed by the Government. That would be a failure. Second, there must be a clear, transparent process for how products enter the fence. This is necessary to encourage innovation. Lenders who create a good product must have the comfort that they can reap rewards from it. For this reason, it is important that the legislation should instruct the CFPA to develop and codify a transparent process by which products will be declared within the fence. To summarize, real people choose badly when faced with technical features as financial choices sometimes require. To prevent a race to the bottom, financial regulation must prevent unfair competition from products with hard-to-understand risks. Ring financial provides one way to accomplish this goal. When effective, it provides a market-friendly alternative to bans and mandates. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENDHIL MULLAINATHAN, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, HARVARD UNIVERSITY 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you, gentlemen, for your testimony. Let me take 5 minutes and then recognize Senator Shelby. General, thank you not only for your testimony, but for your service.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","Thank you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","As a neighbor in Rhode Island, I am well aware of what you have done for your State and for the Nation. Mr. Yingling suggested that we should put our attention on the nonbanking system, and yet your testimony suggests that there are real problems within the banking system because Federal regulators have essentially interfered with your ability to regulate what might be Connecticut chartered companies. Is that fair, and can you elaborate?",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","What has happened, Senator, and that question is a very good one, is that many nonbanking institutions have, in effect, invoked the shield by aligning themselves with national banks. In the gift card area, for example, we have been prevented from stopping expiration dates and dormancy fees on gift cards, from enforcing our State law, because they have used national banks. On payday loans or tax anticipation loans, again, the litigation is cited in my testimony. These institutions have, in effect, allied themselves with national banks to shield themselves from State authority. Again and again, what we have seen is that there has been a very knowing and purposeful resort to the national bank shield to protect these State and even local institutions because they have succeeded in invoking that Federal doctrine. And so the proposal here to put a floor rather than ceiling on the impact of Federal regulation, I think is a very important one. It is hardly novel or new. It is essentially what is done in antitrust and other forms of consumer protection enforcement with the FTC and I think it would eliminate the incentive for these local institutions to, in effect, become part of or integrate their activities with the national banks.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, General. Mr. Yingling, you have just laid out, I think, in your very good testimony, as always, the notion, and one that I think we all ascribe to, that safety and soundness and consumer protection are sort of two sides of one coin. And yet we have seen examples over the last several months where that doesn't seem to be the case. Maybe safety and soundness is not the word, but profitability seems to have come before consumer protection in credit card cases and many other instances, which leads, I think, to the thrust of what the Administration is proposing, that you have an agency that is, in fact, devoted not to this balance between safety and soundness and consumer protection, but has a focus on consumer protection. Your response?",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","Well, first, they are two sides of the same coin and I would just use the famous example now of the mortgage crisis, where that was in many ways a consumer issue, a terrible failure of regulation at both the Federal and State level with respect to regulating these toxic mortgages. At the same time, it is a tremendous safety and soundness question because it has blown up our economy to a large degree in a number of markets. Local banks that maybe never made a subprime loan in their life are being dragged down because the local economy is dragged down. I think the main question we would have with respect to separation is just to use example after example where we feel that we are going to be caught in the middle. So take the account opening process. That is a combination. So we are going to have one examiner come in and say, in your account opening process, you need to change this disclosure. It needs to be clearer. You need to change this process. You need to change the way you are training your tellers. We spend billions of dollars training tellers on all kinds of compliance issues. The safety and soundness examiner comes in and says, I completely disagree with that. If you do it that way, you are going to encourage fraud, and by the way, you are not complying with the Bank Secrecy Act. What are we to do? All the legislation talks about is consulting, but ultimately, both sides have the power to say, you will do it our way. And there is just example after example. Check hold periods are another example where we would be caught in the middle.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Right now, could a Federal regulator make those same calls?",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","One Federal regulator could make the same calls.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","And that Federal regulator, it seems, based on the record of the last several years, to make the call in favor of not consumer protection, but to the ability of the bank to continue to operate, reputational and other----",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","I would not argue with you, Senator, that there have not been failures and that things need to be done. But it is not always profitability. If you look at the check hold period, they have to balance what the consumers would like, which is the money right away, with the fact that we have a multibillion-dollar processing system that is evolving for checks with the fact that we are subject to billions of dollars in check fraud which is ultimately paid for by the consumers.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Plunkett, if you could comment on this discussion, I think it has been a good one.",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","The concern I have is that there are, until the last year, virtually no examples of the current safety and soundness structure putting consumer protection concerns first. The reason we need to go this route is because safety and soundness regulators, and we have to say this based on experience over the last 30 years, the norm for them is to consider the bottom line for the institutions that are regulated, and there is just example after example. I mentioned in my statement overdraft loans, where the regulators appear to have dithered because primarily what is a deceptive practice, that is offering a loan without telling the consumer, charging the consumer fees without giving them a real right to choose to accept those fees, it is a very profitable line of business. So again and again, the norm for safety and soundness regulators has been to ignore consumer protection. It is all well and good to say, well, that should change, but I don't think that that is how safety and soundness regulators typically think.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Wallison, in your written testimony, you quote Justice Brandeis, who wrote, and I will quote, ``The greater dangers to liberty lurk in insidious encroachment by men of zeal, well meaning but without understanding.'' Elaborate on that, if you would, because as I raised earlier the question to Secretary Barr, this is a radical approach, different from our classical approach to regulation, is it not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Yes, I think this is a very paternalistic approach and quite different from anything we have had in the past. In the past, we have always used disclosure, and disclosure can be improved. There is no question----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Absolutely, it can.",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Actually, my AEI colleague, Alex Pollock, has come up with a one-page disclosure form for a mortgage which you would have to look at before you signed up for the mortgage--not at the closing, but when you sign up for the mortgage--and that would list all of the various risks and so forth and the costs of the kind of mortgage that you are taking. That is an improvement----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","In plain English, right?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","In plain English, that is exactly right. People can understand that. Instead, what we are proposing to do here is really to say to providers, you are going to take the risk of offering something more than this plain-vanilla product. If you take this risk and it turns out that the consumer is not pleased with it or we, the regulatory agency, are not pleased with it, you are going to have to pay some very substantial costs in the form of enforcement. This is a completely different way of looking at consumer protection and radical in my view, too.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Could this in a big way ration credit to some people who need it the most?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Well, exactly. The effect of this, of course, is when a provider is confronted with the choice of whether to offer only the plain-vanilla product or the more complex product, he has to decide whether this particular consumer is going to be able to understand the product. And as I quoted in my testimony, the white paper says here that disclosure itself may not be enough. For some people, complexity itself is going to make it difficult for them to sign up for something that they may not understand. So the provider has to make this decision, and what the provider is mostly going to do is say, I am sticking with the plain-vanilla product because if I go any further with that, with this particular consumer, I could get in trouble, and that will reduce the products that are available to consumers, I am afraid.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Financial institutions, as I understand the proposal, will no longer be primarily concerned with discerning and meeting the needs of their customers. Instead, they would be concerned with gaining regulatory approval and avoiding taking any steps that would lead to enforcement actions or, obviously, costly litigation down the road. Do you agree with that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Yes, of course. That is the thing that I think the people in the Administration missed--that there is a very important problem for providers, a very difficult problem in fending off litigation and enforcement activities. They want to comply with the law, and so they have to know exactly what it is that they can do. If they are left in a position where they have to make a decision about the ability of someone sitting in front of them across the desk to understand something, well, there is only one decision they can make and that is to limit what they offer.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Yingling, the proposal states that the agency would have to, quote, ``consider the potential benefits and cost to consumers and covered persons.'' Consider and potential are not very definite words, I would think. Shouldn't the language require that the real benefits must outweigh real costs to consumers and covered persons instead of that? The agency could not meet its mandate, as I understand it, to promote efficient markets if in the end the transaction is not beneficial for both parties in the transaction. That is the way the market works, does it not?",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","Senator, that is basically the only general standard in it. The authority of this agency is broader than any agency, I would say, that has ever been proposed. If I could, let me just read you the one section. This is Section 1037(1)(a). In general, the agency shall prescribe rules imposing duties on a covered person. Now, a covered person is anyone that offers consumer financial services. So the agency shall prescribe rules imposing duties on a covered person as the agency deems appropriate or necessary to ensure fair dealing with consumers. That is it. Every single law you have ever passed, every regulation on the books is trumped by this. They are just floors. And the standard you cited, I could go in the hall with a couple of lawyers and in an hour come back with a paragraph, a boilerplate paragraph with a couple of blanks in it that this agency could put in every rule they write to meet that standard. This agency is empowered to do anything it wants, and I don't know what that means your function is, because that credit card bill you just worked so hard on is now nothing but a floor, trumped by this section.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Shelby. Senator Warner, please.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I share some concerns about some of the Administration's proposals, but I want to go back with Mr. Wallison. I am not sure that I would concur that the sense that the Government is going in certain cases to prohibit certain products as being too dangerous, that that has not been due course of doing business. I mean, we have done it recently. The Fed has done it recently with double-cycle billing in the credit card area. We have had longtime prohibitions against loan sharking. I used to be in a pretty good business in the venture capital business, but we had, as we have discussed, Peter, prescriptions that said not everybody can invest in venture capital fund. You have to be a qualified investor. And I understand the notional difference between investing and access to credit, although I would argue that some of the products that we have created have been all about marginally lowering the cost of risk, and there is some judgment of marginally lowering the cost of risk versus the overall societal downside risk we are taking. There has got to be some balancing here. So I know where you are going to come back at me on this, but I do want you to come back at me in terms of saying, would you say market all the time, no prohibitions at all on any product mix, disclosure alone always trumps?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","No. Thank you for the question, Senator, but that would not be my view. I think there are things that one could--the Senate could, the Congress could--forbid, and should, because some things can actually be abusive. But in general, what we are doing with this legislation is putting providers in a position where they have to make a judgment about the ability of the person sitting across the desk from them to understand all of the factors that go into a particular product that is being offered. And so what we are saying in this legislation essentially is, here is the plain-vanilla product. If you offer this product, you are not going to take many risks because it has been approved by the CFPA and here are the disclosures that the CFPA wants you to make about it. And the provider puts that product in front of the customer and says, ``I think you should take this product'' because the provider has made a judgment that this customer probably can't understand or might not be willing to understand the complexities of the other products that the provider could offer to customers who are more sophisticated and experienced. So the result of that, I think, is going to be only one thing, that many, many people who could understand, with adequate disclosure, products that are going to be better for them and their families will never have those products offered to them.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But in this example, I mean, in the normal marketplace, if we put out a symbol that says ``buyer beware,'' buyer makes the wrong choice and the market absorbs the consequences. But in this circumstance, at least we have seen in recent action there perhaps was not a ``buyer beware'' on some of these exotic financial mortgage products. I have got members of my family that I argued diligently against, don't take that product. You are going to get it. But they saw the up-front sticker price and they bought it anyway. Not everybody has got a wealthy brother to bail them out, although I guess we do have a wealthy Uncle Sam that is now indirectly bailing out. But if at the end of the day the ramifications of buyers making bad choices around the credit markets is that we, the taxpayers, are ultimately going to bail them out, don't we have some responsibility to perhaps put some either ring fencing or some parameters around this? I mean, are we in a different mix of products when we are at the end of the day maybe having the taxpayer be on the hook for bad choices made by consumers? Is there----",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","Senator, buyer beware doesn't always work. As you pointed out, it is not just the new credit card law. In 2005, Congress said payday loans and other high-cost loans are not good for our service members and prohibited them. There is actually a long line of recent Congressional and regulatory measures that have acknowledged that the disclosure-only approach doesn't work. Telling somebody that you are going to deceive them and then deceiving them is not a good thing. So we need to recognize the limits of this disclosure-only approach.",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","This makes my case, I think, and that is there is no way that a provider can offer a product that he is not certain the person sitting across from him understands.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","I think----",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","But that occurs all the time in the securities world. Suitability is embedded in the new legislation that the House has passed on mortgage lending. It is absolutely possible to make those determinations and it is done in law.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","Some products should be banned. Some products should have a ``buyer beware'' sign on them, and that is what the Fed has done, in effect, with their new mortgage regulations. If you cross a certain line, it has a ``buyer beware'' sign on it. What this proposal says is if you deviate in any fashion from the plain-vanilla product, so I will use a different example. I will use basic banking accounts, because that will be part of this. So they design a basic banking account and if the community bank in Nashville says, I have a great idea that the students at Vanderbilt will love. I will add an Internet feature. If Navy Federal Credit Union says, I have a great feature I can add that will be good for sailors at sea, they are no longer part of the plain-vanilla product. Let me read you what this says. This is the thing that was handed out at the White House, the report that went with this legislation. For example, the CFPA could impose a strong warning label on all alternative products, require providers to have applicants fill out a financial experience questionnaire, or require providers to obtain the applicants' written opt-in to such products. Originators, talking about loans, of alternative products should be subject to significantly higher penalties for violations. Why would that bank in Nashville, why would Navy Federal Credit Union offer these changes to the basic vanilla product? It is one thing to have warning labels. It is one thing to outlaw products. It is another thing to say, if you don't offer our product, you are subject to all kinds of new regulatory restrictions. I am quoting them. This is their proposal.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","If I may try to bring together these two points of view from the standpoint of----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Let the record show, Mr. Chairman, that I am not extending my time. The panel is.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","This is the General and it is the General's preference, so go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","The highest I made it in the Marine Corps Reserve was Sergeant, so----",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I am actually in a higher rank.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","If I can bring together these somewhat differing abstract points of view from the standpoint of the cop on the beat, and we are talking here about an enforcement authority as much as a regulator, we may disagree on what should be banned. I think there is some agreement that certain products should be banned. We can disagree on where the floor in enforcement should be. But the question really for this Committee and for the Congress is, should we have a point person, an authority that is accountable for protecting consumers, whether they have a wealthy relative or not, and assuring disclosure, uniform disclosure nationwide in an age where--and this is one of our great frustrations--the mortgage rescue scams, the tax anticipation loans that charge 300 percent interest can disappear into the Internet ether and we need Federal enforcement. Otherwise, even with the best and most vigorous State law enforcers, including Attorneys General, that system will be ineffective. And so I think it is more than which products should be banned, and certainly some of these standards need to be tightened. I accept very wholeheartedly Mr. Yingling's critique of this first draft of the legislation. There need to be stronger standards, perhaps. But do we need an authority that will ally with the States in providing stronger enforcement? My answer is yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","You wouldn't end up being where you have got just the floor set at the Federal level. Could a financial institution ever have felt like they have finally passed muster and they aren't going to be then still subject to 50 additional Attorneys General trying to come after their product, even if they have passed muster at the Federal level?",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","And I think one of the challenges, Senator, and I will be very brief in my response, but I think you have identified, as you did earlier in your questions, one of the key questions, which is how to harmonize Federal and State enforcement. But that is a tension inherent in our Federal system. We go through it in the criminal system with many other areas except where there is total Federal preemption, as in the food and drug area. But if we are going to have State enforcement, there needs to be harmonization. I think the SAFE Act recognizes the potentials for harmonization. So do the recent credit card reforms. I think we are moving in the direction that keeps alive the Federal system, and I think they can be harmonized.",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","Senator, I would just add that if the minimum is high enough, then you will achieve uniformity because most States won't see the need to exceed that minimum.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I thank each of you as witnesses. It is always highly beneficial to us to have people like you here and I thank you for that. Mr. Wallison, I do want to thank you for your comments. I agree with almost everything you have said, and we have met many times. I appreciate certainly your testimony today. Professor, I listened to the pixels and the ring fences and very much appreciated what you had to say, also. I still was unclear, though, as to whether you viewed disclosure--you were talking about the psychology of people purchasing things in an economy--whether you believe that disclosure is enough or whether you believe, like this Administration, that they are wise men that govern ignorant souls that need to be directed as to what to buy and not buy. I still was unclear and I would love some edification there.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mullainathan","Thank you very much. I think it is useful to set two extremes. I think by focusing on contrasts with disclosure, we are failing to recognize that sometimes in this sector we also engage in bans. We have done that with the credit card bill and it will happen again. So to me, the challenge is not about disclosure and moving to do more than disclosure. The challenge is when we are setting up an agency, are we going to handicap it by giving it only two extreme options, disclose or ban. To me, that is unfortunate. That is exactly a bad market solution because there are products which have benefits for some consumers but which are complicated for other consumers. As a result, disclosure might not work. It may be hard to get some consumers to understand fully the most exotic products, but we don't want to ban them because they have genuine benefits for a variety of other consumers. I think that raises a--there is a set of products that fall in that middle, and to me, ring fencing and the proposals in the legislation--and I have to admit, maybe I am reading a different draft. I don't see Government design or Government standards in this draft. To me, what this does is it gives the opportunity, and I think more clarity is needed in the bill and I think moving forward that is where we would need clarity, but it gives an opportunity to say, let us recognize the financial services require some middle ground. Sometimes, we will want to keep exotic products in the mix. Therefore, we won't want to ban them. But we will need something more than disclosure, because a lot of consumers, as with double-cycle billing, there is no single form that is going to simply explain to consumers the most exotic products. And even if there were a single form, the reality of the way you buy something is such that someone can give you that single form and eight other pieces of paper on top of that single form. I have rented cars many times, and I realized the other day, they say, put an X here, an X here, an X here, put your initials there, and sign here. I don't know what I am signing for when I sign those things. I have never read the disclosure on that form. Maybe some of you have. But the point I am trying to make is that marketing is very powerful. Disclosure for many customers for exotic products won't necessarily work, but at the same time, I wouldn't want to resort to a ban every time we encounter that situation. And I think it is that middle ground that is trying to be attained by this bill. Though, I understand the risks if that middle ground is not done well, and I would think the challenge of working and crafting this bill is to give the agency another tool beyond either of these extremes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","I will just say Section 1036 of the bill, Standard Consumer Financial Products or Services, clearly authorizes them to mandate products and to put restrictions on products that are not mandated.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Which brings me----",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","The idea is not to have a bureaucrat designing a product, Ed. The idea is to, as we heard from the Administration, make sure that as a class there are alternatives.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","I can only deal with what the statute says and what their proposal----",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I would like to interject here, if I could.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","Sorry, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you both for your vigorous help in this. So, Mr. Yingling, you have been before us before, and obviously because of the group that you represent, people are going to say that when you say that we can do this within the confines that we now have, you are basically arguing for the status quo. I know that is not what you are arguing for. But if you would, tell us how within the present regulatory system that we have we can ensure that there is consumer protection. And, second, what kind of products do you think would go away under this type of regime? Good products, by the way.",Speech, 
"Mr. Yingling","Well, first we are not arguing for status quo. The status quo has been a failure, and so we are arguing for change. One thing I would point out is there has been a significant change in terms of the power of the agencies using UDAP. And if you look at the credit card regulation--which you all trumped with a stronger bill, but a lot of it was in that regulation-- this is a new era. The use of UDAP by the regulatory agencies is much stronger, and we would recommend that a bill that was passed by the House last year which grants that authority in a coordinated fashion to all the regulatory agencies should be adopted. You are going to deal with a systemic oversight regulatory that is controversial, but that systemic oversight regulator should have the authority to look at these consumer issues in a coordinated fashion. One of the great obvious failures is why our Government did not see--did see, to a large extent, but was not really charged with saying look at the graphs in the growth of these kinds of loans, let us investigate it, let us stop it. The systemic regulator should be given that charge. There should be a coordinated place in the Federal Government where consumers can call in. You raised that point. It is a very legitimate point. They do not know where to call. There should be a coordinated place where they can call, and then the statistics are kept, and that is referred for action to the correct regulator. There should be greater coordination at the Federal level with the States. I think we have gotten into the habit of having these court fights, and in reality we should be sitting down at the table between the States and the Federal regulators and figuring out how to do it. There are a number of things that could be done. In terms of products that would be innovative, every single day in this country in some bank they are thinking of how to adjust a mortgage product, adjust an automobile loan, adjust a basic banking account. They are sitting around a table saying, ``Oh, if we could add this Internet feature, if we could add a feature for senior citizens.'' They are constantly adjusting. And some of those fail; some of those helped in their market; some of them become great products that others start to offer. And I can only deal with the language that they have offered. All those are not plain-vanilla products. Any time you deviated, you would not be a plain-vanilla product. And so if that is not going to chill innovation, I do not know what is, because you are subject to all kinds of extra rules if you cannot make those deviations.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and, gentlemen, I want to say that the comments you have made indicate to me that while you want to see strong consumer protection, because that is what you do, and you see abuses, that you, too, even see this bill in its present form as an overreach and that we have a lot of work to do to get it right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Blumenthal","I would agree with everything you have just said except perhaps with the term ``overreach.'' And I do not mean to quibble or criticize. I agree with you wholeheartedly that this bill is a first draft; it needs refinement, it needs work. And I think with your help, with Senator Shelby's, and with all the Senators who are here, particularly Senator Dodd, we are going to reach the goal line. But I do think that a point of accountability somewhere that your constituents can call when they have a question or a problem and they need an enforcer to protect them against a usurious interest rate or any of the abuses we have been talking about here I think is tremendously important. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony. Mr. Yingling, I appreciate many of the comments you made. I know you spent a lot of time in your testimony talking about community banks, and I am concerned about the pressures we are putting on them. But it was not just community banks. If it was just community banks, we would not be in trouble. You know, we have Bank of America, we have given it a lot of money; Citi, we have given it a lot of money. So while I understand your focus on community banks, the reality is that we have a range of banks here, some which clearly acted in ways that were not, I guess, in their interest and certainly not in our collective interest because they created systemic risk, and that is why we are giving them enormous amounts of money. And while I think you have some legitimate concerns in your testimony, I am concerned, as I have said in the past to the association on other matters, is that, you know, I read the elements of what you have listed here as improvements that can be made. And, you know, my concern is that if the industry does not get out there and be for significant changes, then it will face a legislative action that it probably will not like at the end of the day. And so I hope that when you say that we are not for the status quo and we are for change--but I read the changes and, you know, centralized call centers and, you know, basically saying that we should enable basic products, you know, when even in your testimony you recognize some of those problems become overly complex and difficult, as well as that they often have consumers buying products or enhancements that are not right for them, for which they pay too much, you know, is not in my mind the type of reform we are going to need. I appreciate what you talked about on OTS. That is, I think, a good offer, but after that it seems very little to me. So I would urge, you know, the association to be more aggressive in what they are offering here in terms of a legislative response. And I am concerned, you know, that--I look at where we are at, and it seems to me that a lot of, prior to the crisis, financial institutions changed their charters to shop for lenient regulators. And it seems to me that by imposing uniform regulations on consumers financial products across all types of financial institutions, one of your concerns, but listening to the Secretary pretty much sound to me like we are talking about all types of financial institutions no matter who regulates them, wouldn't the Consumer Financial Protection Agency reduce the incentives to shop for more lenient regulators, at least with respect to consumer product legislation? So I think that while we can tailor this a little better, the reality is that we need this. So, you know, I am--I hope the industry will be a little bit more forthcoming in terms of real change so that we can strike the right balance at the end of the day between having the financial products we all want to see open to consumers but having the protections that are critical at the end of the day. And it is in that spirit that, you know, I certainly come to this with, and I hope others do as well. I just get, you know, a sense--you know, Mr. Plunkett, when most Americans go apply for one of the hundreds of different kinds of mortgages, they do not typically bring a financial adviser along with them, do they?",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","No.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","And when a mortgage broker or lender talks to somebody about a 5-1 interest-only ARM or a negative amortization loan, how many people do you think really understand that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","I wouldn't--Senator, you make some very good points here. What we have heard so far from the financial services industry in terms of their ``reforms,'' I heard a systemic regulator maybe, but I heard no discussion of eliminating regulatory arbitrage. I heard no discussion of consolidating the consumer protection approach in any fashion to make it more effective. I heard no discussion of any systemic approach to improving consumer protection regulation. I heard the regulators are getting a little better, so we might as well leave things as they are. That is not going to work given the current situation. We need something broader, and we need an agency that is focused just on consumers.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","So it just seems to me that when we go down the list of questions of what the average consumer might find themselves in, we see the incentives, for example, in the mortgage crisis for lenders to move people into products that, at the end of the day, may be very beneficial to them but not very beneficial to the consumer. And when millions of people enter into those transactions and then have consequences when those first 5 years end and cannot meet their obligations, then we have systemic challenges to our economy. So it just seems to me why should we have the borrowers simply fend for themselves? I believe all in personal responsibility. I would love us to have greater financial literacy commitments as a country from education, to engagement, even our financial institutions to do so. But at the end of the day, if we allow millions of people based upon incentives that move individuals to try--entities to try to move individuals to products that are good for the lender and/ or the broker but bad for the consumer and millions ultimately make a mistake and then create the consequences that we have today in the housing market, it affects all of us.",Speech, 
"Mr. Plunkett","Well, Senator, I hope that when we heard discussion today about choices, we were not hearing about choices like the large number of minority consumers who were steered into high-cost mortgage loans when they could have afforded and would have qualified for a lower-cost loan. I hope we are not talking about choices like what Congress has just eliminated in the credit card bill, not just double-cycle billing but interest rate increases on existing balances for no apparent reason. I mean, that is called ``negative financial engineering.'' That is not legitimate innovation. And that is the kind of, unfortunately, choice in many credit areas that has driven out positive credit, credit offered by some of the small banks you mentioned or credit unions.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, Mr. Chairman, I hope that we will-- you know, I do have concerns about how we structure this in a way that affects community banks that clearly have not been at the forefront of our economic challenges. We need to look at that. I do get concerned about how we harmonize the State regulator process with these efforts. And, third, I do want to see--I think Mr. Yingling does make a very valid comment that we have to apply--if we are going to have this consumer protection agency, which I generally support, it has to be applied across the spectrum of financial service entities; otherwise, we would do a disservice to the consumer, to the Nation, and certainly to the industry as well. So I look forward to working toward those goals.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Menendez. Senator Shelby, you have a comment?",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","I have got a couple of scenarios here that I think we ought to consider. In case one, a borrower obtains a subprime loan, the only loan he could qualify for, and uses it to buy property and then realizes a 75-percent gain on the property 3 years later. This goes on. In case two, a borrower obtains a subprime loan in another market. This borrower has all the same credit and income characteristics at the time he received the loan as the borrower in the first scenario, but later loses his job, sees the real estate market collapse, and then defaults. I believe we need a system where we can accommodate both. How do we do that? In other words, the first guy--and this goes on--took a subprime loan and he made money out of it. Good for him, good probably for the market. The second one, he had the same qualifications, but things turned sour on him. He lost his job, and then he could not make the payments and so forth. How do we do this? Mr. Wallison, do you have any--how do we balance this, I guess?",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","I think, Senator Shelby, you are focusing on exactly the problem here, which is trying to determine in advance what a person understands. The first person you are talking about--that consumer--may or may not have understood all of the elements of this loan, but it worked for him. It might not even have been the best loan he could have gotten, but it still worked for him. In the second case, it did not work for him. I am looking at it, again--and I must do this because we have to consider the way this works in practice--from the standpoint of the provider. The provider is going to be very much at risk if he offers a loan to the first or the second person--the same loan----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","That is right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","Which goes beyond the plain-vanilla structure. If he does, the second guy--who did not make any money--is going to come back to him and complain about that or complain to the CFPA about him. And providers have to worry about this because they can be driven out of business very easily.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","By litigation.",Speech, 
"Mr. Wallison","By an enforcement action or a litigation or by a State Attorney General. So I think when the Committee is looking at this, you have to look at it from the standpoint of both the consumer and the provider, because the provider's decisions on whether to make these loans will affect very much what the consumer can get.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mullainathan","If I may, I would like to add two comments to that, if I----",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Quickly.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mullainathan","Quickly. One comment is providers are in the business already of detecting whether consumers understand or not. It would be unfortunate if a consumer took out a loan they could not repay. So one of the things providers do is actually assess whether the person--a good provider, whether the person understands the payments owed to them. So I do not think this is novel business practice. Second, I think we have to ask the question who should bear the risk of a consumer not understanding. I think part of the risk should be borne by the consumer, but some of the risk should be borne by the firm. So I think the question is, do we leave the tilt of the balance all on the consumer or do we say the firm bears some of the risk as well of a consumer not understanding. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Senator Merkley has joined us, but he has been very gracious, and I just want to make two comments. I think the testimony has been excellent. We have several challenges. The two primary ones are ensuring there is a comprehensive form of consumer protection, which has been proposed in one agency. And then a second issue is the authority of that agency to conduct the operations. Those I think are the two basic issues. I think also, too, I would just point out for the record that there is no private right of action included in this proposal. So there might be complaints to regulators, but the suggestion that this is going to set off a wave of private claims it not included in the legislation. Also, I think the presumption at least that I start out with is that this agency will be subsuming the existing legislation authority of the Fed, of the different regulators, not have sort of an open-ended sort of role in crafting any sort of ideas they want. Truth in Lending Act, HOEPA, all those things now would shift--that legislation, that authority would shift to the agency. So I again want to thank you all, and I particularly want to thank Senator Merkley, because I think we are ready to go. Thank you, gentlemen. The hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
