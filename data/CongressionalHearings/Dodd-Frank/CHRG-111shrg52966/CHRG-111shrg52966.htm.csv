"Senator Reed","Let me call the hearing to order. Let me first apologize for the extra delay. We were engaged in voting, and these things take longer than we usually expect, but thank you very much. I want to thank you all for joining us here today. This financial crisis has demonstrated that, contrary to the presumption of many, financial institutions were unprepared and in many cases incapable of adequately assessing the risks that they were bearing on their books. The governance structures, the firm managers, and sophisticated models all failed to capture the magnitude of the risks that were building. Now the mistakes and poor risk management by these financial institutions and their regulators have become the taxpayers' problems, with the effects spiraling through the broader global economy. The trillions of dollars in losses stand as witness to the many failures of risk management at these firms. Blame must primarily be placed at the feet of these financial institutions which gambled and then cashed in on exorbitant transaction fees for creating exotic new financial products. The guiding presumption of many, including former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, was that self-interest would keep these firms from engaging in overly risky behavior; and if that was not sufficient, then surely market discipline would rein in excesses. But, in reality, both proved inadequate to constrain excessive risk taking. The drive for short-term profits led to irrational behavior that affected many, not just a few firms. When self-interest and market discipline break down, we hope that the safety net of regulators will guide us out of the storm. However, if the people engaging in these complex transactions did not understand the risk, the regulators, it appears, based upon the report we have been given today, might have known even less. The capacity to conduct oversight of the risk management function at these firms was in many cases lacking. During the good times, when all the excesses were building up, the regulators did not press hard enough. Yet it is during these times that it is most important, as excesses encourage a sense of fearlessness about risk taking, that the regulators act promptly to constrain the exuberance. Perhaps more fundamentally, the regulators should be asking hard questions. When new financial products are drawing in unprecedented profits, they should be asking pointed questions about the cash-flows and how the products work, including how they perform in good times and bad. Reverse engineering these products is critical if regulators are to understand how they operate and know their embedded risk. Regulators also need a firm-view on risk. As we heard in testimony last week concerning AIG, the firm stopped offering credit default swaps on CDOs and mortgage-backed securities in one area of the firm, at the same time it started risky securities lending in another area of the firm. Another bank claimed it was never involved in subprime lending, yet it was buying mortgage lenders engaged in the practice and securitizing such products. Last June, I called a similar hearing to discuss risk management and its implications for systemic risk. Unfortunately, further variances in risk management have taken place since that time. The purpose of this hearing is to bring to light the specific problems and to find a positive way forward. This hearing is particularly important given the need for swift and yet deliberate regulatory reform. GAO at my request, after last June's risk management hearing, undertook a study of the risk management function of those regulators responsible for large financial institutions. GAO reviewed a sample of large, complex financial institutions to determine what the regulators knew, when they knew it, and what changes were requested as a result of the regulatory examinations and inquiries. While GAO will be sharing this in testimony, I wanted to highlight a few findings that I found particularly troubling. Regulators found problems as early as 2005, 4 years ago, with the risk management systems at large, complex financial institutions, but often were not aggressive in insisting on changes at firms until market events made the problem self- evident. A Federal Reserve review conducted in 2006 concludes that no large, complex financial institutions they reviewed had sufficient enterprise-wide stress tests to determine what economic or other scenarios might render the entire company insolvent. Moreover, many large, complex financial institutions could not sufficiently measure or manage all of their risk at a consolidated level; rather, they focused on risk within various subsidiaries without looking at the health of the entire holding company. Even knowing this, regulators did not significantly change their ratings of such firms until the crisis emerged. Because of the sensitive nature of the information, I would ask that my colleagues avoid asking about any currently ongoing financial institution by name. Instead, I think the focus here is on the performance of the regulator and also in general the performance of these regulated entities. The GAO's review comes at an important time in our history. It is the kind of deep analysis that should guide us forward as we take up questions on regulatory reform that will serve as the foundation for financial oversight as we go forward. In short, major regulatory reform is coming. I hope that we can learn from what has transpired, move forward with a stronger safety net, and build a strong financial system. At this time, I would like to recognize the Ranking Member,","Speech",""

"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Chairman Reed. This is my first hearing working with you on this Subcommittee. I am glad to be here, and I look forward to working with you for years to come. I think what we are going to hear today from our witnesses is that failures in risk management that contributed to our current economic crisis were not just the result of problems with our laws or poor decisions by firms. No, there was also a failure by regulators to recognize the dangers and, even worse, a lack of will to do something about the problems that they did find. Mr. Chairman, I find that deeply troubling. I also find the example of the 2006 Federal Reserve study mentioned in the report to be extremely troubling. The Fed found that none of the institutions it looked at had stress tests that covered the entire company and none of the tests to see what would make them insolvent. That is bad and shows the irresponsibility of the firms. But as far as I can tell, the Fed also did little or nothing about it. That is worse and should throw cold water on the idea of some that the Fed should be the new risk regulator. I find the admission by some regulators to GAO that they did not understand the real risk or the importance of contributing factors to be refreshing, but still very troubling. Those admissions should raise questions about whether we can ever create a risk regulator that will understand and act to stop systemwide risk. In a system of ``too big too fail'' when market discipline has been removed by bailouts, we have to rely on regulators to make sure firms do not get into trouble. But if our regulators are unable to find problems and unwilling to do something about them, we are in real trouble, and maybe we need to reconsider the whole concept of relying on regulators to be the last line of defense against all problems. Why should we think a few changes in the law will magically make them more effective the next time around? We can try to fix problems with our current system, but we cannot legislate will or competency. Instead, we need to build a system where everyone is accountable and has incentives to perform due diligence, a sort of check-and-balance, so if any one party does not do so, it will not lead to an overall failure. The system also needs to be robust enough to handle the failure of individual firms, and we should assume that firms will fail, because they do. To handle that, we need to improve the authority of regulators to take control of and shut down failing firms through some type of orderly bankruptcy. We also need to hold directors and executives accountable. If everyone knows they will face the consequences of their actions, they will be more careful in the future. I think that will go a long way in the future to creating a stable financial system than rearranging the furniture downtown at various regulators. Again, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am looking forward to hearing from the witnesses.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING"

"Ms. Williams","Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Bunning, I am pleased to be here today to discuss lessons learned from risk management oversight at large, complex institutions. At your request, we initiated work in December to review the risk management oversight of large institutions by the banking and securities regulators, namely, the Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and FINRA. Our objectives were to: one, identify how regulators oversee risk management at large institutions; two, identify the extent to which regulators identified shortcomings in risk management at selected institutions prior to the financial crisis; and, three, how some aspects of the regulatory system may have contributed to or hindered their oversight. However, I need to note that Section 714 of the Federal Banking Agency Audit Act generally prohibits GAO from disclosing nonpublic information about an open bank. Therefore, I will not disclose the banking institutions included in our sample or provide detailed information obtained from the examinations or interviews with examination staff. First, we found the regulators generally maintained continuous contact with large complex institutions using a risk-based examination approach that aims to identify areas of risk and assess these institutions' risk management systems. But the approaches of the banking and securities regulators varies somewhat. Likewise, the regulators generally use a combination of tools and activities to assess the quality of risk management. For example, bank examiners review the activities, products, and services that an institution engaged in to identify risk and then, through continuous monitoring and targeted examinations, assess how the institution manages those risks. When regulators identify weaknesses in risk management at an institution, they have a number of formal and/or informal supervisory tools they can use for enforcement and to effect change. For the examinations we reviewed, we found that regulators had identified numerous weaknesses in institutions' risk management systems prior to the beginning of the financial crisis. However, regulators did not effectively address the weaknesses or in some cases fully understand their magnitude until the institutions were stressed. In hindsight, the regulators told us that they had not fully appreciated the risks to the institutions or the implications of the identified weaknesses for the stability of the overall financial system. We also found that some aspects of the regulatory system may have hindered regulators' oversight of risk management. For example, no regulator systematically and effectively looks across all large, complex institutions to identify factors that could have a destabilizing effect on the overall financial system. In closing, I will share a few observations. First, while an institution's risk managers directors, and auditors, all have key roles to play in effective corporate governance, regulators, as outside assessors of the overall adequacy of the system of risk management, also have an important role in assessing risk management. Yet the current financial crisis has revealed that many institutions had not adequately identified, measured, and managed all core components of sound risk management. We also found that for the limited number of large, complex institutions we reviewed, the regulators failed to identify the magnitude of these weaknesses, and that when weaknesses were identified, they generally did not take forceful action to prompt these institutions to address them. Second, while our recent work is based on a limited number of institutions, these examples highlight the significant challenges regulators face in assessing risk management systems at large, complex institutions. While the painful lessons learned during the current crisis bolster market discipline and regulatory authority in the short term, effective regulation requires that regulators critically assess their regulatory approaches, especially during good times, to ensure that they are aware of potential regulatory blind spots. This means constantly re-evaluating regulatory and supervisory approaches and understanding inherent biases in regulatory assumptions. While we commend recent supervisory efforts to respond to the current crisis, the new guidance we have seen tends to focus on issues specific to this crisis rather than on broader lessons learned about the need for more forward-looking assessments and on the reasons that regulation failed. Finally, the current institution-centric approach has resulted in regulators all too often focusing on the risks of individual institutions and regulators looking at how institutions are managing individual risks, while missing the implications of the collective strategy which is premised on the institution having little liquidity risk and adequate capital. Whether the failures of some institutions ultimately come about because of a failure to manage a particular risk, such as liquidity or credit risk, these institutions often lack some of the basic components of good risk management, for example, having boards of directors and senior managers set the tone for proper risk management across the enterprise. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member, this concludes my oral statement, and I would be happy to answer any questions at the appropriate time.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ORICE M.

"Senator Reed","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, it is my pleasure today to discuss the state of risk management in the banking industry and the steps taken by supervisors to address risk management shortcomings. The Federal Reserve continues to take vigorous and concerted steps to correct the risk management weaknesses at banking organizations revealed by the current financial crisis. In addition, we are taking actions internally to improve supervisory practices addressing issues identified by our own internal review. The U.S. financial system is experiencing unprecedented disruptions that have emerged with unusual speed. Financial institutions have been adversely affected by the financial crisis itself, as well as by the ensuing economic downturn. In the period leading up to the crisis, the Federal Reserve and other U.S. banking supervisors took several important steps to improve the safety and soundness of banking organizations and the resilience of the financial system, such as improving banks' business continuity plans and the compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act and anti-money-laundering requirements after the September 11 terrorist attacks. In addition, the Federal Reserve, working with the other U.S. banking agencies, issued several pieces of supervisory guidance before the onset of the crisis such as for nontraditional mortgages, commercial real estate, and subprime lending, and this was to highlight the emerging risks and point bankers to prudential risk management practices they should follow. We are continuing and expanding the supervisory actions mentioned by Vice Chairman Kohn last June before this Subcommittee to improve risk management at banking organizations. While additional work is necessary, supervised institutions are making progress. Where we do not see sufficient progress, we demand corrective action from senior management and boards of directors. Bankers are being required to look not just at risks from the past, but also to have a good understanding of their risks going forward. For instance, we are monitoring the major firms' liquidity positions on a daily basis, discussing key market developments with senior management and requiring strong contingency funding plans. We are conducting similar activities for capital planning and capital adequacy, requiring banking organizations to maintain strong capital buffers over regulatory minimums. Supervised institutions are being required to improve their risk identification practices. Counterparty credit risk is also receiving considerable focus. In all of our areas of review, we are requiring banks to consider the impact of prolonged, stressful environments. The Federal Reserve continues to play a leading role in the work of the Senior Supervisors Group whose report on risk management practices at major U.S. and international firms has provided a tool for benchmarking current progress. Importantly, our evaluation of banks' progress in this regard is being incorporated into the supervisory exam process going forward to make sure that they are complying and are making the improvements we are expecting. In addition to the steps taken to improve banks' practices, we are taking concrete steps to enhance our own supervisory practices. The current crisis has helped us recognize areas in which we can improve. Vice Chairman Kohn is leading a systematic internal process to identify lessons learned and develop recommendations. As you know, we are also meeting with Members of Congress and other Government bodies, including the Government Accountability Office, to consult on lessons learned and to hear additional suggestions for improving supervisory practices. We have already augmented our internal process to disseminate information to examination staff about emerging risks within the industry. Additionally, with the recent Federal Reserve issuance of supervisory guidance on consolidated supervision, we are not only enhancing the examination of large, complex firms with multiple legal entities, but also improving our understanding of markets and counterparties, contributing to our broader financial stability efforts. Looking forward, we see opportunity to improve our communication of supervisory expectations to firms we regulate to ensure those expectations are understood and heeded. We realize now more than ever that when times are good and when bankers are particularly confident, we must have even firmer resolve to hold firms accountable for prudent risk management practices. Finally, despite our good relationship with fellow U.S. regulators, there are gaps and operational challenges in the regulation and supervision of the overall U.S. financial system that should be addressed in an effective manner. I would like to thank you and the Subcommittee for holding this second hearing on risk management, a crucially important issue in understanding the failures that have contributed to the current crisis. Our actions with the support of Congress will help strengthen institutions' risk management practices and the supervisory and regulatory process itself--which should, in turn, greatly strengthen the banking system and the broader economy as we recover from the current difficulties. I look forward to answering your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ROGER T. COLE, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF BANKING SUPERVISION AND REGULATION, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"

"Mr. Long","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, my name is Tim Long. I am the Senior Deputy Comptroller for Bank Supervision Policy at the OCC. I appreciate this opportunity to discuss the OCC's views on risk management and the role it plays in banks we supervise, the weaknesses and gaps that we have identified in risk management practices and the steps we are taking to address those issues, and how we supervise risk management at the largest national banks. Recent events have revealed a number of weaknesses in banks' risk management processes that we in the industry must address, and we are taking steps to ensure this happens. More importantly, these events have reinforced that even the best policy manuals and risk models are not a substitute for a strong corporate governance and risk management culture, a tone and approach to business that must be set at the top of the organization and instilled throughout the company. While risk management practices are legitimately the focus of much current attention, risk management is hardest when times are good and problems are scarce. It is in those times when bank management and supervisors have the difficult job of determining when accumulating risks are getting too high and that the foot needs to come off the accelerator. These are never popular calls to make, but in retrospect, we and bankers erred in not being more aggressive in addressing our concerns. However, we must also not lose sight that banks are in the business of managing financial risks. Banks must be allowed to compete and innovate, and this may at times result in a bank incurring losses. The job of risk management is not to eliminate risk, but to ensure that those risks are identified and understood so that bank management can make informed choices. Among the lessons we have learned are: Underwriting standards matter, regardless of whether the loans are held or sold. Risk concentrations can excessively accumulate across products and business lines. Asset-based liquidity is critical. Back-room operations and strong infrastructure matters. And robust capital and capital planning are essential. As described in my written testimony, we are taking steps to address all of these issues. Because the current problems are global in nature, we are working closely with my colleagues here and internationally. Critical areas of focus are on improved liquidity risk management, stronger enterprise-wide risk management, including rigorous stress testing, and further strengthening the Basel II capital framework. Risk management is a key focus of our large bank supervision program. Our program is organized with a national perspective. It is centralized and headquartered in Washington and structured to promote consistent and uniform supervision across the banking organizations. We establish core strategic objectives annually based on emerging risks. These objectives are incorporated into the supervisory strategies for each bank and carried out by our resident onsite staff with assistance from specialists in our Policy and Economics Unit. Examination activities within a bank are often supplemented with horizontal reviews across a set of banks. This allows us to look at trends not only within but across the industry. Throughout our resident staff, we maintain an ongoing program of risk assessment and communication with bank management and the board of directors. Where we find weaknesses, we direct management to take corrective action. For example, we have directed banks to make changes in personnel and organizational structures to ensure that risk managers have sufficient stature and ability to constrain business activities when warranted. Through our examinations and reviews, we have directed banks to be more realistic about recognizing credit risks, to improve their valuation techniques for certain complex transactions, to aggressively build loan loss reserves, to correct various risk management weaknesses, and to raise capital as market opportunities permit. Finally, the Subcommittee requested the OCC's views on the findings that Ms. Williams from the GAO will be discussing with you today. Because we only recently received the GAO's summary statement of findings, we have not had an opportunity to review and assess their full report. We take the findings from GAO very seriously, and we would be happy to provide the Subcommittee with a written response to this report once we receive it. My preliminary assessment based on the summary we were provided is that the GAO raised a number of legitimate issues, some of which I believe we are already addressing; and others, as they pertain to the OCC, may require further action on our part. Thank you, and I will be happy to answer questions you may have.","Statement","STATEMENT OF TIMOTHY W.

"Senator Reed","Thank you. Mr. Polakoff, please.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Good afternoon, Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning. Thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of OTS on the lessons the current economic crisis has taught us about risk management. The topic is timely and important because, as you know, the heart of bank supervision is in monitoring for risks, to help prevent them from endangering the health of regulated financial institutions. Some of the risks I will discuss today not only endangered institutions during this crisis, but played major roles in some failures. The financial crisis has had serious consequences for our economy and for public confidence in the safety of their bank accounts and investments. This confidence and the trust it engenders are necessary for both the smooth operation of our financial system and the larger economy. Restoring confidence is essential to achieving full economic recovery. In my comments today, I will focus on three risks that I think are most significant: concentration risk, liquidity risk, and the risk to the financial system from unevenly regulated companies, individuals, and products. Shortcomings in responding to each of these risks have significant consequences. Let me start with concentration risk, which is basically the risk of a financial institution having too many of its eggs in one basket. If something bad happens to that basket, the institution is in trouble. Although concentration risk is one of the main risks that our examiners traditionally watch closely, the current crisis exposed a new twist to concentration risk, and the OTS has acted to address that risk. The new twist was the risk of a business model heavily reliant on originating mortgage loans for sale into the private label secondary market. The freeze-up in this market for private label mortgage-backed securities in the fall of 2007 exposed this risk for institutions with an originate-to-sell business model. Their warehouse and pipeline loans could no longer be sold and had to be kept on their books, causing severe strain. To prevent this problem in the future, the OTS reviewed all of its institutions for exposure to this risk, updated its examination handbook in September 2008, and distributed a letter to the chief executive officers of OTS-regulated thrifts on best practices for monitoring and managing this type of risk. The financial crisis also taught us lessons about liquidity risk when some of our institutions experienced old-fashioned runs on the bank by panicked customers. In some cases, the size and speed of the deposit withdrawals were staggering. The event showed that the prompt corrective action tool created to prevent a gradual erosion of capital during the financial crisis of the late 1980s and early 1990s is inadequate to address a rapidly accelerating liquidity crisis. Rather than seeking a new type of prompt corrective action for liquidity, Federal banking regulators plan to issue guidance to examiners and financial institutions to incorporate lessons learned on managing liquidity risk. Finally, I would like to discuss the risk to the financial system and the larger economy by companies, individuals, and products that are not regulated at the Federal level or, in some cases, at any level. These gaps in regulation are, in my mind, the root cause of the crisis. If you could distill the cause to a single sentence, I think it would be this: Too much money was loaned to too many people who could not afford to pay it back. The simple lesson is that all financial products and services should be regulated in the same manner, whether they are offered by a mortgage broker, a State-licensed mortgage company, or a federally regulated depository institution. To protect American consumers and safeguard our economy, consistent regulation across the financial services landscape is essential. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for having us here today. I look forward to answering your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SCOTT M. POLAKOFF, ACTING DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION"
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Polakoff. Dr. Sirri?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and members of the Subcommittee, I am pleased to have the opportunity today to testify concerning insights gained from the SEC's administration of the Consolidated Supervised Entities, or CSE, program, as well as the SEC's long history of regulating the financial operation of broker-dealers and protecting customer funds and securities. The turmoil in the global financial system is unprecedented and has tested the resiliency of financial institutions and the assumptions underpinning many financial regulatory programs. I believe that hearings such as this, where supervisors reflect on and share their experiences from this past year, will enhance our collective efforts to improve risk management oversight of complex financial institutions. A registered broker-dealer entity within the CSE group was supervised by an extensive staff of folks at the SEC and at FINRA, the broker SRO. All U.S. broker-dealers are subject to the SEC's rigorous financial responsibility rules, including the net capital rules, the customer protection rules, and other rules designed to ensure that firms operate in a manner that permit them to meet all obligations to customers, counterparties, and market participants. The CSE program was designed to be broadly consistent with the Federal Reserve oversight of bank holding companies. Broker-dealers have to maintain the minimum of $5 billion of tentative net capital to qualify for the program and no firm fell below this requirement. The CSE regime was also tailored to reflect two fundamental differences between investment bank and commercial bank holding companies. First, the CSE regime reflected the resilience of securities firms on mark-to-market--the reliance of securities firms on mark-to-market accounting as a critical risk and governance control. Second, the CSE firms were required to engage in liquidity stress testing and hold substantial liquidity pools at the holding company. We also required firm-wide stress testing as a prerequisite to being allowed to enter the program, a requirement that was put in place well before the crisis started. For most firms, the stress testing comprised a series of historical or hypothetical scenarios that were applied across all positions, not just across one product or business line. While the set of scenarios did not cover every plausible scenario, they included major financial shocks or stresses to the market, such as the fall 1988 failure of long-term capital in the Russian default as well as the 1987 stock market crash. The CSE firms later expanded these scenarios or created others to stress their hedge fund counterparty credit risk exposures. I, too, appreciate the work that GAO did to review the supervision of financial institutions' risk management programs across the various regulators and find their observations on these programs very helpful. We are reviewing the recommendations and findings and we look forward to working with GAO as we fully consider their report. The SEC's supervision of investment banks has always recognized that capital is not synonymous with liquidity and the ability of a securities firm to withstand stress events depends on having sufficient liquid assets, cash and high- quality instruments, such as U.S. Treasuries, that can be used as collateral to meet their financial obligations as they arise. For this reason, the CSE program required stress testing of liquidity and substantial liquidity pools at the holding company to allow firms to continue to operate normally in stressed market environments. But what the CSE regulatory approach did not anticipate was the possibility that secured funding, even that funding backed by high-quality collateral, such as U.S. Treasury and agency securities, would become unavailable. Thus, one lesson of the SEC's oversight of CSEs, Bear Stearns in particular, is that no parent company liquidity pool can withstand a run on the bank. Such a liquidity pool would not suffice in an extended financial crisis of the magnitude we are now experiencing. In addition, these liquidity constraints are exacerbated when clearing agencies' sizable amounts of capital for clearing deposits to protect themselves against intraday exposures to the firm. Another lesson relates to the need for supervisory focus on the concentration of illiquid assets held by financial firms, particularly in entities other than a U.S.-registered broker- dealer. Such monitoring is relatively straightforward with larger U.S. broker-dealers, which must disclose illiquid assets on a monthly basis in financial reports that are filed with their regulators. For the consolidated entities, supervisors must be well acquainted with the quality of assets on a group- wide basis and monitor the amount of illiquid assets and drill down on their relative quality. Leverage tests are not accurate measures of financial strength for investment banks, in particular due to their sizable matchbook or derivatives business. Leverage tests do not account for the quality or liquidity of assets. Rather, they rely on overly simplistic measures of risk, such as leverage ratios. Regulators of financial firms have gone to a great deal of effort to develop and continue to refine capital rules that are risk sensitive and act as limiters on the amount of risk that can be taken by a firm. Finally, any regulator must have the ability to get information about the holding company and other affiliates, particularly about issues and transactions that impact capital and liquidity. As we have witnessed with Lehman Brothers, the bankruptcy filing of a material affiliate had a cascading effect that can bring down the other entities in the group. For these reasons and to protect the broker and its customer assets, the SEC would want not only to be consulted before any such liquidity drain occurs at the parent, but to have a say, likely in coordination with other interested regulators, in the risk, capital, and liquidity standards that the holding company must maintain. Our experience last year with the failure of Lehman's U.K. broker and the fact that the U.S.-registered broker-dealers were well capitalized and liquid throughout the turmoil has redoubled our belief that we must rely on and protect going forward the soundness and the regulatory regime of the principal subsidiaries. Thank you for this opportunity to discuss these important issues and I am happy to take your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ERIK SIRRI, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF TRADING AND MARKETS, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Senator Bunning had to step out. He will rejoin us for his questioning, but let me begin. I want to address a question to all the regulators. first, let me say that I thought the GAO did a very responsible and thorough examination. Thank you and your colleagues Ms. Williams. But the basic questions are, and I will begin with Mr. Cole, just as you happen to be sitting next to Ms. Williams, but when did you first institutionally become aware of the significance of the risk difficulties in your supervised entities, and how did you communicate these concerns both to your supervisors, to your fellow regulators, and to a broader audience, and when did that communication become public? Mr. Cole?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Well, I really need to go back somewhat in time in answering that, but in 1995, we issued a supervisory letter to our examiners directing them in terms of taking a systematic approach to assessing the risk management, including the major risk categories of credit risk, market risk, operational risk, liquidity, reputational, and legal risk, and then that became part of the formal exam process and rating process. Kind of fast forwarding to the 9/11-type situation, as I mentioned in my testimony, we focused on some significant risk issues there that we thought needed to be addressed, and some of them tended to focus on, say, operational risks, such as payments and settlements, others on contingency planning, locating backup facilities at appropriate different distances, and then very importantly on BSA/AML, Bank Secrecy/Anti-Money Laundering. In that regard, with regard to one of the institutions in question, we took very strong action to require a significant change in their business risk management and that was accomplished with a very forceful hand in terms of requiring them to make those changes. So I think that is a good example of where, when we see a significant problem, we do act.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me be more specific. The issue, I think, that the GAO has revealed is a lack of the capacity of large complex financial institutions, which all of you regulate, to assess adequately all of the risks they face, not so much a particular risk----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","----but the fact that they did not have systems in place to adequately assess the risk, which I think is a fair conclusion of the report of the GAO. At what point did this fact or this observation become resonant with the Fed and how was it communicated to the banking community, to the regulating community, and on to the broader audience, the Congress, for one?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","We have been engaged consistently, I think, since--just going back, say, to the 1995 letter, in terms of working with institutions to enhance the risk management process. Now, in terms of moving right to the current situation, this stress testing example is a good example because we believe going into that stress test that there was a significant opportunity to put pressure on the big firms to improve their ability to pull positions together on a firm-wide basis and develop a really robust stress test. The horizontal review that we did provided very significant information for us on a peer basis that they were not able to do that, that the stress that they typically came up with was one quarter's worth of earnings, and that was based on a fairly flawed system of not being able to comprehensively pull the positions together on an integrated firm-wide basis.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","That was----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","We used that as a major tool in terms of pushing on those firms. It was feedback from that exercise and saying, look, you need to do more here, and that is one of the main tools that we have, is that type of horizontal review. So that occurred, say, in June 2007, that kind of feedback with the firms on the findings from that stress testing. Then I would move just a little bit further----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Can I just clarify? Is it June 2007 or 2006?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","The actual exercise was in 2006. We did the report in 2007 and then the feedback to the firms, I think was in June of 2007.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","It raises an issue, which is that in 2006, you had at least had serious concerns because of the stress testing that these firms could not handle or have systems in place to deal with the risk The whole point, I think, of the report of the GAO is that having that knowledge of those suspicions, it didn't seem to produce a timely, rapid response----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Well, Senator, I think that at the same time that we were doing the stress testing, we were also reviewing and having very significant interactions with these firms in terms of various aspects of their risk process----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me just ask. Did you communicate in 2006 with other supervisors, OTS, Comptroller, SEC, your concerns that some of the institutions that you were the overall supervisor had these deficiencies in risk assessment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Well, we have very frequent conversations with--","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Would you say fairly that you communicated these concerns to the other regulators, or you heard similar concerns from them?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","I would say fairly that, as we are working on, for example, infrastructure requirements for the use of models and so on, we have had consistent communications with the other regulators that there are significant deficiencies in risk management.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And let me just ask a final question, because I do want your colleagues to respond, too. What broader audience did you communicate these concerns about the lack of adequate systems in place?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","We have throughout the development, for example, of qualifying criteria for the use of Basel II and the so- called Pillar 2 criteria indicated the need for improvement to the firms we have been working with.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Long, similar questions. When did you, not personally, but the organization, become aware, if you did, of failings in the management of risk by entities you supervised? Did you communicate them to your fellow supervisors? Did they communicate with you, and then what broader audience?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Yes, I do think we began to communicate pretty well in the 2006 range, as my colleague says, but let me back up to answer you. I want to make sure I answer your question. As I stated in my written testimony--it is difficult at times to strike that balance of letting a bank keep competitive and innovative at the same time and order a bank to constrain a certain business activity because we believe they are taking on too much risk. It is always a delicate balance and it is something we work hard to do. But I think we did, going back to 2004. I know at the OCC and amongst other regulators, we did begin to see this buildup of risk and this buildup of excessive aggregation of risk. We issued guidance going back to 2004. We had the interagency credit card guidance. We issued guidance on home equity lending, on non-traditional mortgage products, on commercial real estate lending, and then most recently some interagency guidance on complex structured products. As we issued guidance to the industry, our examiners were in the banks and they were examining for this. We frequently cited matters requiring attention and began taking actions, various types of actions, surrounding these guidance. So from 2004 up to 2007, I think we all saw the accumulation of risk. At the OCC, we looked vertically very well into those companies. If there were lessons learned by us, it was probably in two things. Number one, we underestimated the magnitude of the effects of the global shut-down beginning in August of 2007, and we did not rein in the excesses driven by the market. So a real lesson learned, and I think you have heard it in some of the statements and in the GAO report, the ability to look vertically into these companies is good. The ability to look across the companies in terms of the firms we supervise, we need to get better at that, and looking horizontally across the system is something I think we all need to do. A good example of that is in the firms that we supervise, we underestimated the amount of subprime exposure they had. We basically kicked the subprime lenders out of the national banking system. Our banks were underwriting very little of the subprime loans. What we didn't realize is that affiliates and subsidiaries of the banks that we supervised were turning around, buying those loans, structuring them, and bringing that risk back in in another division in the bank, and that is a good example of being able to look horizontally across a company and see that coming.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","What inhibited you from looking across these other subsidiaries?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Well, Senator, there are two things. You know, internally, from the OCC's standpoint, we need to get better at doing more horizontal work, and I think we have. I think we started doing that probably a year and a half ago, where we have networking groups. We do more horizontal-type exams to where REICs can share information amongst themselves. Where we are continuing to work with our other colleagues with the other agencies is making sure that we try to gather the risk in the entire system. But obviously all of us are constrained somewhat by GLBA.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me, Mr. Polakoff can I finish this line of questioning and then I will recognize you, Jim.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I will stay as long as you want.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, thank you. I don't want to embellish on what my colleagues have said. It is a consistent message. I would say a trip-wire date for us was June of 2007 when the liquidity market shut down. What it proved to us and probably all of us at this table is we did not stress test models sufficiently for that kind of catastrophic event. So risk management turned upside down at that point in time. When any of these models predicted a stress scenario, and even a more stress scenario, none of us, none of the entities still predicted or had a model that stressed a scenario for what ultimately we saw starting in June of 2007 forward. That is a critical lesson learned for all of us.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Dr. Sirri?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","The one thing I would point out that is slightly different with the CSEs that reentered this business in a different manner, the firms that we regulated under the CSE program came to us because of the European Union Financial Conglomerates Directive for that purpose. They needed a consolidated holding company supervisor and they didn't have one for that purpose. So we came at this from rule, not by statute. We crafted the regime where in exchange for certain capital treatment we would be given a limited amount of access to the holding company. What we focused on and what that access related to were financial and operational risk controls, and in that sense, I think that was very helpful, informed broker-dealer oversight issues as well as certain issues of the holding company. But, for example, as my colleagues have pointed out, Gramm- Leach-Bliley limits the way we touch upon other regulated entities. We defer to the functional regulator in that sense. And so our knowledge there was more limited. So I think what you are really asking is a point which was made in the GAO report which says, if an enterprise, if a modern firm manages risk at an enterprise level, how can you as a regulator that is in many ways functionally based replicate that in your own regulatory program, and I acknowledge that is a challenge.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me follow up with a very quick question because I want to recognize Senator Bunning. Given the fact that you had to rely upon other regulatory agencies, what was the level of communication? If, in fact, by 2004 or 2005 the OCC was aware of buildup of risk, at 2006 the Federal Reserve was aware of risk, I would presume that in that same--so did anyone sort of, in a systematic way, say, you know, you should be aware that we are concerned about risk assessment, about the ability to manage this enterprise risk? Did that ever become part of the discussion?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I think we all--I won't speak for others. I think we understood, and my impression was all of these regulators understood, that we were limited in part. We had dialog amongst ourselves. Staff on the ground talked to staff from other regulators. In addition, the firm--it is not like the firms drew up walls and said, we won't give you information on that bank, or we won't give you information on that thrift. They would provide such information. But in the sense of integrated enterprise risk management, I think it was not what it could be.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Senator Bunning, and take as much time as you want.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome back from your vacations that you have been on for the last 5 years, and I say that not kiddingly. I say that as meaningful as I can, because if we would have had good regulators, we wouldn't be in the crisis we are in right now. Ms. Williams, at the bottom of page 24, you said the Fed did not identify many of the issues that led to the failure of some large institutions. Can you tell us what some of these issues that they are, what they missed?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","Absolutely. I would direct your attention to a couple of pages later, on page 26. We note that the Fed began to issue risk committee reports, and in February of 2007 they issued perspectives on risk, and we list a number of issues that we pulled from that report. For example--the report stated that there were no substantial issues of supervisory concern for large financial institutions; that asset quality across the systemically important institutions remains strong; in spite of predictions of a market crash, the housing market correction has been relatively mild and while price appreciation and home sales have slowed, inventories remain high and most analysts expect the housing boom to bottom out in mid-2007. Overall, the impact on a national level will likely be moderate. However, in certain areas, housing prices have dropped significantly. They also noted that the volume of mortgages being held by institutions or warehouse pipelines had grown rapidly to support collateralized mortgage-backed securities and CDOs and noted that the surging investor demand for high-yield bonds and leveraged loans, largely through structured products such as CDOs, was providing a continuing strong liquidity that resulted in continued access to funding for lower-rated firms at relatively modest borrowing costs. So those are some of the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Would you like to comment on counterparty exposures, particularly to hedge funds?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","This was another area that was identified. The regulators had focused on counterparty exposures, particularly to hedge funds.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Cole, would you like to respond?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","I would indeed, and thank you for the opportunity, Senator. First of all, I would say that my understanding is that the report that the GAO has done is really based on review of one institution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That is incorrect, but that is fine.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","OK, and that we received this report with reference to perspectives on risk just in the last couple days. So we would like an opportunity to go over these findings with the GAO, as we typically do in GAO reviews. We have not had that opportunity. But I will say this, that I think that what Ms. Williams quoted from is in the report, but unfortunately, there are other parts that were not quoted, and one in particular is, quote: The effects of a long period of easy liquidity and benign credit conditions have continued to weaken underwriting standards across all major credit portfolios. Finally, we note that investor demands appear to be encouraging large financial institutions to originate more assets and even greater volumes of low-quality assets, and in order to distribute them through the capital markets. In response to that, we took very firm actions, and that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","When?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","That included----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","When? When did you take firm actions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Let me see. A perspectives of risk report was issued in February 2007----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Two-thousand-and-seven?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","And we initiated major analysis of subprime mortgage markets in March and published an interim report in June of that year.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Two-thousand-and-seven?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","That is correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","OK. That is about 5 years after the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Well, that is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That is about 5 years after the subprime and the mortgage mess hit the fan. Two-thousand-and-two and 2003 is when it hit.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","But could I also----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","No, you can't.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","What did the Fed do about the 2006 review that showed institutions did not have overall stress testing for their own enterprise? Did you require your regulated firms to fix those problems?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Yes. I actually touched upon that in a prior response, that we did follow up with the institutions, that a very critical part of this type of horizontal peer review is going back to the institutions, which we did in June of 2007. The report was actually issued in February of 2007 and had communications with those firms indicating that there was significant need for improvement. We also, I am told, communicated to the primary regulator--","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You were told or you know?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","No, I know. I was informed in the interim of my last question that the primary regulators of these institutions were informed of the deficiencies we observed, as well as the President's Working Group. So it was----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, that is all well and good if you followed up and made sure that they weren't going to repeat the same mistakes in the immediate future and subject the country to the recession that we are now in.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Right, and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","If you sat on your hands, which the Fed did in overseeing mortgages and mortgage lenders and banks that were under your jurisdiction, then I think that the Fed is a failure in doing what they are supposed to do. For anyone, did the board of directors understand the risk their firms were taking?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, I would say they understood the risk for the period of time that they were operating in, but failed to----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In other words, what I am trying to get at, there is a reasonable rate of return on equity that everybody expected at a given point in time. Somehow, that got out of kilter, and instead of being happy with a 7 or 8 percent return on equity, people were leveraging from--and I don't blame anybody, but regulators ought to be looking at the rate of return on equity and not giving permission for these firms to get into mischief, and that is what happened. That is why we are here today asking you these questions. The regulators should have stopped the risk takers taking undue risk with taxpayers' money or with equity that has been invested. Now the taxpayers are paying the price. So go ahead, finish your answer.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","I agree with what you said, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","And how do we improve senior management and boards' understanding of an accountability for risk? How do we get that regulated?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Well, across the spectrum, all of the boards, I believe, are held accountable for the risk and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Is that right? Is that why we are paying bonuses to each and every one at AIG for--they were the board, they were the people that were supposed to regulate AIG. So we are paying them bonuses for taking $160 billion in taxpayers' money. Are you kidding me? Explain that to the American people.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","AIG right now is not a regulated company. I--","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","It is. It is owned by the Federal Government, so the Federal Government is the regulator. It is owned by the Federal Government. The contracts that have been paid out were OKed by the Federal Government. So it is regulated.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Yes, sir. I was speaking only from an OTS perspective.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","OK. It is not yours. It is ours. How did you miss the risk and possibility of liquidity drying up? How did you miss it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I can speak for the firms that we regulate. For a trading firm, for a securities firm, they do not take deposits as a commercial bank or a thrift does. Their primary means of funding is through the capital markets, especially through a market known as the repurchase market.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I am familiar.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","What a firm does is it takes the security it has, it gives it someone who lends it out----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I am familiar.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","----it comes back. Because that is a secured lending market, the lenders were thought to be not sensitive to the health of the firm, but sensitive to the quality of the collateral they got. So our thought was always that if you as a firm gave someone a Treasury bill or gave them an agency security, they would take that and fund you, even if you as a firm were in trouble. That was an assumption we made, and that is, I think, many in the financial community made. And we were wrong. When firms got in trouble, other funding counterparties-- money market funds, people with cash to lend--would not take Treasury's to fund, and that was something we had never seen before.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Long, what changes in law do you suggest to protect against future failures like we are in right now?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Senator, I do not know if I can think of a change in law that we need. We need to continue to have rigorous supervision around these companies. As I said in my written statement, you need a strong corporate culture, and it needs to start at the top of the organization, and it needs to be led by the Chairman and put down into the company. It is a simple----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That, unfortunately, is not an answer. Ms. Williams, do you have any changes in law that we can get a hold of as we are looking for as Members of Congress to prevent any more of the debacle that is going on right now?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","I would just touch on a couple of issues. In January, GAO issued a framework for reforming the current financial regulatory system, and we point out a couple of issues. One would be clearly articulated goals; that is, Congress needs to be very clear about the goals that they expect regulators to achieve. There also needs to be a systemwide focus in the structure. And----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In other words, A watching B and B watching C?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","Not necessarily, but systemwide from the perspective of not focusing on particular institutions and getting caught up in the institution or type of product; but having a regulator that can focus attention on anything that poses a risk to the overall system.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Then we would need one for about 25 major market banks, money market banks in New York City, one regulator each for each one, because those are the ones that are too big to fail. That is what we have been told by our Chairman of the Fed, in fact. And we have also been told that by the Secretary of the Treasury. So if that is the case, we need an awful lot of regulators. Scott, do you have some suggestions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, I would offer that we need to ensure that there is a level playing field. We have had some products--80 percent of subprime loans were underwritten by mortgage brokers. There is no Federal oversight for that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, I am sorry, but the Federal Reserve got that job in 1994. That was their job. I mean, we wrote a law that gave them that job. Whether they did it or not is another question, but we handed that over to the Fed. SEC?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","Our charge is the broker-dealer, primarily, and so I am going to translate your question as: What do you need to make sure that we keep safe the customer's----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","No. What would give the SEC the ability to discover this situation that we are in now before or as it is happening and do something about it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","Drexel, Lehman Brothers taught us the same lesson. The lesson is that the health of a broker-dealer could be affected by entities outside the broker-dealer--commercial banks, thrifts, unregulated affiliates that deal in derivatives. We need to touch on those entities. We need to have a say-so on risk.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In other words, we should take all manners of dealing with a broker-dealer, whether it be securities, whether it be bonds. You mentioned some other things that they are dealing with now. But we should have someone watching the store for all entities.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I think, again, I was focusing on the broker- dealer, but I know that our charge is affected by risks that are taken outside the broker-dealer. You do not hold derivatives in a broker-dealer, because we haircut the capital--we haircut you, we charge you capital. So firms respond by moving the risk outside the broker-dealer, by moving illiquid instruments outside the broker-dealer. That still imperils the broker-dealer. We need to touch on those. We need----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, then you need regulations over those people that are dealing in the entities.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","For preserving the broker-dealer, that would be very helpful.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator Bunning. Let me raise a few questions. You mentioned, Dr. Sirri, that really what happened, in your view, was a run on the bank. And I think that begs the question: What caused the run on the bank? There are some people that suggest the huge amount of leverage which the market became aware of just undercut any sort of willingness to accept even Treasury securities. And that leverage ratio was something that was approved by the SEC--at least not effectively disapproved--and I think you had the authority to do that. Can you comment on that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","Sure. The question of a ``run on the bank,'' which is the term I used, is always a difficult one because it implicitly depends on confidence in the institution. Of course, we did not have a bank, and the run was different. It was not deposits. But, nonetheless, it was funding with certain kinds of securities through the repo market. You know, it is hard to know why something like that starts. The instruments became the instruments in these firms, in some of the firms that are no longer with us. Lehman Brothers, for instance, suffered a lot of uncertainty about valuation, so you have a financial firm, they are typically opaque. You do not know exactly what is going on with them. That is the nature of a financial firm. Valuations become questions because you are holding, for example, commercial whole loans in the case of Lehman, where people doubted valuations. In a situation like that, people will be wary about funding because even if you can potentially get your money back, you are not in the business of getting tied up in an uncertainty. And that causes a situation that can cause a run.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Let me ask a general question, which I do not think requires a specific answer unless you--my assumption is that the umbrella regulator--and each one of these large institutions had an umbrella regulator--had the responsibility for the risk assessment throughout the organization, that it was not a case where the overall enterprise risk assessment or enterprise activities were not at all under the authority of a regulator. Is that your understanding, Dr. Sirri, in terms of the law?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","Well, I think the authority stems from different places. Again, we had no statutory authority.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Right, right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","We crafted rules. I think in other places it is statutory. And, again, our ability--our question of where we would look was governed by a certain set of precepts and risks. Our concern was always the broker-dealer. Risks that pertained to things other than the broker-dealer that might imperil other entities were not our charge, and our program was not crafted to cover those.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Polakoff, your responsibility derived from statute. Did you feel at OTS that those entities you were the umbrella supervisor, that you had responsibility for enterprise risk analysis, assessment by the enterprise?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Yes, sir. The only thing I would offer is per Gramm-Leach-Bliley we did rely to a great extent on functional regulators within the system. But as the holding company regulator for our institutions, absolutely we had the overall umbrella responsibility.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Long, is that your understanding? I know OCC is--do you have an umbrella responsibility? Let me ask the basic----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","We are the primary regulator for the bank, absolutely. Our authority and how we conduct our risk assessments I think works very well, and we feel like we have the proper authority.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","So you understand that you have to collaborate with others, but that ultimately there is one Federal regulator under the statute--Mr. Sirri has an exception--that had responsibility to look across the organization for risk assessment, risk evaluation, and risk compliance?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Well, I am sorry. Maybe I did not understand your question. The way it works now is it is dependent on how well we communicate with each other and--if that is what you are asking, Senator. I want to make sure I am answering your question right. Is there a systemic umbrella regulator right now that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I am not talking systemic. I am talking about you have a large, integrated financial organization that is regulated under statute. There is one regulator who is responsible for the overall operation, and let me ask the question. Is there one regulator responsible for the overall operation of the entire enterprise?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Well, the OCC is responsible for the bank, and the Fed is responsible for the holding company.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me talk to Mr. Cole. As the umbrella regulator of several large financial institutions, do you feel that you are responsible, the Federal Reserve is responsible for the overall capacity of that institution as an enterprise to evaluate risk?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Yes, sir, we do, and we have gone, I think, an extra mile to make sure that that is very clear with the firms and our examiners by rolling out a Consolidated Supervision Program in October of last year and communicating that very clearly with the other agencies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me go back to the point that was raised between Ms. Williams and Senator Bunning about the large financial institutions' perspective on risk, the 2005 reports, the 2006, 2007 reports. These were internal documents, Ms. Williams, of the Fed? These were not released to the public?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","Yes, these were internal.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And then there was an interruption in the reports, but then in April of 2007, there was a report, ``Perspective of Risk.'' Was that an internal document, too?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","Yes, all of them were internal.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And it raises the question with respect to the Federal Reserve that if these documents are solely within the purview of the Federal Reserve, how is the broader financial community and the broader community and how is Congress to inform itself of critical issues that you feel could have profound consequences, which have profound consequences?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","One issue is just getting our own shop in order in terms of pulling all the information that is available to gather and creating a perspective on risk from a financial stability point of view. There is that process. We do have that process. We have a formal umbrella group that is in charge of making periodic reports to the board on information that is drawn from research and from our shop and other payments areas and so on. So we are very focused in terms of creating a holistic picture of what is happening in the financial system now. That is very important. Now, you know, the question in terms of how do we go kind of the step of somehow making that public, and it could well be--you know, it obviously would be worthwhile in some form to be public. I cannot answer that at this point.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, you know, I guess one presumption would be to have this information. I understand there is proprietary information that you have, and also there is a concern about causing market movements based not upon, you know, financial information but other information. But I think if such information was in the public domain in some capacity in 2005 and 2006 and 2007, it was available to Congress, and there was no opportunity for testimony to communicate that, that there might have been earlier prompter and more effective action to deal with some of these issues which are bedeviling us at the moment. In that regard, too, I know, because we have had the chance to meet, that the Federal Reserve and all those agencies are taking a serious look backwards. You know, you have described some of your conclusions. Ms. Williams and her colleagues have provided some perspective. But these reports--I will use the term I learned as a youth. These After Action Reports have to become public, particularly in the context of organizing a systemic regulator. Because if we are unaware, if you remain, you know, opaque, it is hard for us, I think, to make a reasoned judgment about who should have responsibilities, what could be the lines of communications. I know Governor Kohn and his colleagues are working on this report.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I would hope it would be public. Let me ask another question, and it comes from the GAO report, which is the comment and the conclusion that in many respects you are captives of the information of the organization you are regulating, that you have to rely to a certain degree on their models, their information. And in some cases, I think talking with respect to counterparty risk, there are intuitions about the creditworthiness of counterparties. Is that a fair summary of your conclusions, Ms. Williams?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","Basically.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me begin with Dr. Sirri and work the other way, which is, you know, being a captive to information to systems to model sometimes does not give you the leverage you need to take action. Is that, one, accurate? And, two, how do you change that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I think there is an element of accuracy to that, but I think there are tools available to us as regulators. Let me give you a specific instance. You are right, a particular complex financial firm will develop a model for risk, but they will have a process around that model for risk. And we care about the processes and the robustness of the processes and controls. So, for example, a model for risk is developed. Who validates it? Who verifies it? Who runs that model? If they report to the trading desk whose assets they are pricing, that is not helpful and that is problematic. If they report to an independent third-party that perhaps reports directly to the CFO or a risk officer, much stronger structure, gives you some comfort. Again, let me take a second one, a price verification group. You may have a firm that trades assets, but they have problems valuing assets, as you do when liquidity dries up. When valuations are struck, how are those valuations struck? There may be a model. Who validates the model? And how do you resolve disputes? If the trader says it is worth more than the risk person says it is worth, how do you resolve that? Is there a process where it could go up to the audit committee? And if it goes to the audit committee, does the After Action Report-- the phrase you used--for that instance, does that go to the board of directors? Such processes, if they are in place, tell you that that firm is taking their job seriously.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I would presume, and correct me, that those procedures, those appropriate procedures you described, were not being deployed very successfully at Bear Stearns or Lehman Brothers. Were you aware of kind of those deficiencies contemporaneously with their----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I do not want to comment on any one firm, but what I will say is that there was considerable variation across the firms, especially with--let us take that same point, pricing. And one thing we saw--and this is mentioned--issues like this are dealt with in the Senior Supervisors report that the New York Fed led. The stronger your governance, the stronger your controls, it turns out the better you probably weathered the storm. The best-run firms had good processes, and some of the firms that got into the most trouble had distinct weaknesses. It varied from firm to firm.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Just to follow up, the firms that you saw, and some of which have failed, did you note those weaknesses? Did you communicate those weaknesses to the board? It goes to the essence of many of the questions we have raised. You know, making the diagnosis that you are ill and then not treating the patient is, you know, malpractice. What do you think?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","We had escalation procedures, and we used them. I do not want to come here and tell you that every time we did it perfectly. But I personally met with audit committee members when I felt that there was an issue that was not being resolved properly. But I do not want to overstate and say in each way we escalated as far as we should have looking back. We probably should have done more at times.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Polakoff, same general line of questions about the reliance upon internal models, the data of the company, sort of captive of what they are doing versus being-- having the resources to leverage appropriately behavior.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, I would say that there is an element of truth to that statement in the report, but it probably does not capture the entire universe. What we do and we do very well is put boots on the ground. We have examiners that go onsite from one large institution to another large institution. And while there may be a stable--and there is a stable examiner in charge, we send specialists from institution to institution, which allows a horizontal review, which allows an assessment of best practices. So whether it is modeling, whether it is pricing, whether it is risk factors, we do not silo the examination approach. And that is very helpful in addressing these kind of issues. That is number one. Number two, we look to the outside parties, so whether it is the external auditors, whether it is the external accountants, we work with them on models, because they also bring a similar expertise of looking horizontally across a number of institutions for best practices in a number of areas. And then, number three, like Erik said, we look at the corporate governance of the institution itself; how is it structured, how robust is the risk management committee, how robust is the audit committee as part of the board, how are the reporting lines handled. Each of those three areas, I think, allows us to very independently assess and judge whether it is the risk models or other factors.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Having listened to that, it is, I think, very insightful, and it seems to be a great approach. It just does not seem to have worked in the case of some of the institutions that you regulated. What would you point--that was not the approach that was being used in 2004, 2005, and 2006? Or it was an approach, but something else undermined it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","It was the approach. Senator, the one common theme that all of us see is an economic cycle that was unprecedented in its deterioration. All of our institutions, all of our risk management practices, all of our examination approaches work well, but it is difficult to look at all the risk models and stress them to unprecedented degrees and then require institutions to operate within those stress models. You know, in hindsight, we should have predicted a little better in 2004 and 2005 what the economy was going to look like now, but the economy we are operating in now has an absolute direct effect on the performance.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, let me raise--because this has been publicly discussed. I think we actually discussed it last week. In 2005, the Financial Products Division of AIG concludes that mortgage-backed securities are too risky a bet. At the same time, the securities lending operation decides that they want to take the cash that they are getting and invest it decisively in these types of securities. You know, where was the risk assessment at the enterprise, as you described it? And where was the OTS to say, wait a second, you cannot have two contradictory approaches based upon, one, this is the best investment, and, two, this is the worst investment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","So, Senator, you are right, and you identified what is either a hole or an overlap, depending on one's view. Those activities, as you remember, were regulated by the State insurance commissioners. So under Gramm-Leach- Bliley, the umbrella regulator typically will defer to the functional regulator to assess the risks and then report up to the umbrella regulator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","But, you know, it goes back to the question I raised before, to which I think you affirmatively responded, that in terms of overall risk mechanisms or risk compliance, that it was clear that the umbrella regulator had that responsibility. And here, if you had communicated with the supervisor and they had indicated that this was the investment pattern of the securities lending--their regulated insurance part, it would have seemed to have raised a huge red flag. You both cannot be right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, I can assure you that there was ample communication between OTS in its umbrella responsibility and the functional regulators. But you are identifying an absolute inconsistency, which is, Why did we stop one function from performing that kind of activity? And why did another functional regulator allow its entities to move forward with it? There has to be a postmortem on what broke down in that process.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Yes. Mr. Long, the same sort of set of issues about reliance upon information and being a captive of the regulated entity.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Well, I agree with what Scott said. I am not going to repeat it. I think we have ample authority to take whatever action we need. I think it is an oversimplification to say that this was a modeling problem. If you go back to the last time we went through this and you talk to the CEOs that went through this back in the late 1980s and early 1990s, they are going to tell you there are two things that got them: one was the concentrations, and number two, mitigating the policy overrides on the underwriting. Quite frankly, I think that is really the center of this thing. This was not that we missed a bunch of models. Clearly, the banks were not modeling in their tail risk that there would be a complete shutdown of the liquidity across the system. And that was a problem with their models. But this goes to basic underwriting, and it goes to basic concentration risk. They had too much of a bad deal, and that has compounding effects on liquidity, and on capital. And when the global liquidity market shut down, they had a real problem. So, yes, we look at all of it. We look at corporate governance. We look at underwriting. We look at all of the risk areas. And, clearly, we look at modeling, too. We have rigorous stress testing around those models. And, quite frankly, a lot of people missed it--they would stress tail risk in the company. They did not stress tail risk across the world.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Cole, briefly, if you could, please. I have additional questions.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Indeed, Senator, we clearly, as umbrella oversight supervisors, rely significantly on the functional regulators. I will say, though, that in terms of really doing our job, if we sense that there are deficiencies and need to do more than the functional regulator is doing, we do reserve the ability, I think--under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, in fact, by authority to go in and do more.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Ms. Williams, you talked about and we have had a discussion about communicating concerns, looking at regulatory structures, looking at the governance, et cetera. But there is another way sort of to get the message across to the marketplace, and that is enforcement action. That is public enforcement action that is clear to everyone that there is not only a particular situation, but a category of situations that regulators are concerned about. Did you touch upon that in your report about the--or your review about the follow-up enforcement, any follow-up enforcement, official enforcement actions, rather than informal discussions?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Williams","I think we did touch on the process and the range of options, and the fact that with the banking regulators, in particular, there was a tendency not to pursue formal public actions, formal public enforcement actions. It has to do with the fact that it does become public and that can have an adverse impact on an open bank.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Can I--can you cite a situation, Dr. Sirri, where the SEC took a formal enforcement action with respect to the risk practices of any of the regulated entities?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sirri","I am not sure I can cite a public action, something that has happened and been closed. I will cite something that is public. I do not know the current list, but a number of months ago we stated how many cases we had in progress on matters related to subprime mortgages. Now subprime mortgages run the gamut, the cases from issues about origination through issues related to other things within large firms. It would not surprise me, and it may be possible, I honestly do not know, that there might be something related in there. But I truly do not know. And even if I did, I should not comment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Polakoff?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","Absolutely, Senator. We took public enforcement action against AIG regarding some of its inappropriate lending.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","No, I am talking about the issue of risk assessment, risk management, the issues that have been the subject of this GAO report?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","I cannot--I am not sure about all of the specifics from the GAO report, but I think Ms. Williams said that for some of the larger institutions the regulators were shy in pursuing formal enforcement action because it was public. And I would like to suggest that that would not be an accurate statement, at least from an OTS perspective.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","And what actions did you take with respect to AIG?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Polakoff","It was a cease and desist order. We took a cease and desist order against a large institution on the West Coast for BSA-related problems. And these are all formal and public. I do not think any of the banking regulators would shy away from taking formal enforcement action because it is public. We do not shy away because it is public. We do not shy away even when an institution is trying to raise capital. We have to do the right thing from an enforcement action perspective.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Long, your view?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Congressman, we have taken both formal and informal enforcement actions, and we use them regularly. But let me clarify something because I think it is important to this point. Congress specifically gave the banking regulators specific authority to either do a series of informal actions or a series of formal actions. And you know, in some cases, we choose to go informal and we go non-public. I want to assure you that that is no less rigorous than formal action. I have been in the boardroom for the signings of many informal documents throughout my career and recently. And I can assure you that the environment in that room in the signing of the informal documents can be a career-altering experience for the management of that firm. The fact that it is informal does not mean that it is not serious and not taken seriously.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I am not suggesting that these are not serious actions and you are not serious about your actions. It is just that many times an action which is publicized gets the attention of more people than just the people in the boardroom. And behaviors change not just within that boardroom of that organization but throughout the system.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Long","Senator, that is a good point and we look at every action that we take and we weigh the pros and cons. We feel like we use both effectively. But we do utilize both and we do it regularly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Cole?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cole","Yes, with regard to the BSA situation that I mentioned earlier, that was a formal public action. I would tend to agree very much with Mr. Long in terms of figuring out what the most effective approach is given the management situation. And if we can effect change by going directly to the management and accomplishing that, that is what we would tend to do rather than taking the next step of going to a formal action.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, I do not think there is a--this is so specific of a situation that you have to have some deference to regulators. But going to the core issue we have had of just the perception, I think, that was growing throughout the community of regulators that risk systems, risk compliance, attention to risk was not being emphasized enough, and then trying to deal with it on a case-by-case quietly, did not seem to work. I think that might be one of the conclusions we draw. Not to say you did not have the authority to do it or your judgment was-- but it just did not seem to work. I want to thank you. I want to thank, again, Ms. Williams and her colleagues for, I think, a very good report. I want to thank you for questions and we will continue to probe all of these issues as we go forward. Thank you very much. The hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
