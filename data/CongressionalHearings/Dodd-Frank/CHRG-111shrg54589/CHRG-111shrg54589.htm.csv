"Chairman Reed","Let me call the hearing to order. I want to thank all of our witnesses for joining us this afternoon. I am particularly happy to welcome back Chairman Schapiro. Thank you. And also I want to thank Chairman Gensler for asking to testify before us on the derivatives issue, which gives us a chance to talk directly to you about this issue which transcends several different agencies, and also Pat White from the Federal Reserve. Thank you. I also, obviously, want to recognize Chairman Harkin and his colleagues on the Agriculture Committee for their longstanding work on derivatives issues, and I look forward to having both Committees coordinate closely as we work to provide transparency and reduce risk in the financial sector. This week, we find ourselves more focused than ever on the important work of modernizing an outdated financial regulatory system. I have called this hearing to explore one of the key aspects of such reforms: to modernize the regulation of the over-the-counter derivatives markets and the institutions that participate in these markets. Both exchange-traded and over-the-counter markets have grown extremely rapidly over the past decade. Until the recent downturn of the economic markets, every category of derivatives saw almost a decade of extreme growth, in many cases more than tripling or quadrupling trading volumes. According to data compiled by the Congressional Research Service, between 2000 and 2008, the number of financial futures contracts traded on exchanges rose by 425 percent, and the total notional amount of over-the-counter contracts outstanding rose by 522 percent over that period, representing trillions of dollars of trading. This afternoon's hearing will focus in particular on over- the-counter derivative markets which today are subject to no direct regulation. One of the key questions we will examine is the extent to which existing and emerging derivatives markets should be subject to regulatory oversight. Until recently, the prevailing presumption was that market discipline alone largely protected us from any potential risks we faced from OTC derivatives. But we received a wake-up call, having had to seize AIG to keep its credit default swaps, worth trillions of dollars, from greatly exacerbating the financial crisis. It is now clearer than ever that we need to find ways to make these markets much more transparent and to ensure that the dealers and other users of these markets do a better job than AIG of ensuring that their derivative activities do not threaten the stability of the overall financial system. But we face difficult questions as we move forward in accomplishing this goal. These products are often extremely complex, and there is an equally complex history of regulation, or lack thereof, of such products. As a result, we need to take a careful and thoughtful approach to these issues. There is no doubt that improving the regulation and oversight of derivatives markets, and those who trade in them, is a key part of modernizing our financial regulatory system. I hope my colleagues and our witnesses will help us identify the key steps that we can and should take right now to address the serious problems that we are confronting. For example, what key decisions need to be considered as Congress weighs proposals to move more over-the-counter derivatives to central counterparties or exchanges? How do various proposals to enhance oversight of OTC derivatives affect different market participants? How does the issue of improved OTC derivatives regulation relate to broader regulatory reform issues, such as the creation of a new systemic risk regulator? And to what extent do U.S. efforts require international coordination? And these are just a few of the challenging questions that we will face together, and we will rely on your expertise and your insights as we go forward. At this time, I would like to call on the Ranking Member, Senator Bunning, for his comments. Senator Bunning.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate all of our witnesses coming here today for this very important hearing. It is important for everyone to understand the financial nature of derivatives and, thus, the Banking Committee's interest in overseeing them. Let me say at the beginning that I do not know what regulations and restrictions we should put on these products. Figuring that out is the purpose of this hearing. But it should be clear to everyone that the current regulations are not enough. I understand the desire of firms to hedge their risks, whether those risks are interest or exchange rates, commodity prices, credit exposure, or something else. Genuine hedges that are accurately priced can provide the risk management that firms need. But it is not clear that all derivative products are genuine hedges or accurately priced. In fact, some look a lot more like a way to get around regulations and proper risk management, or just plain gambling. Regulators in the public need a better understanding of all the exposures of firms to eliminate uncertainty and the justification for further bailouts. Increased transparency and standardization of derivative contracts will help and must be accomplished. How far standardization requirements should go depends on whether there are true economic benefits to the custom products that outweigh the costs and risks associated with them. So far, specific and credible evidence on that point is thin. Credit derivatives may present the toughest questions. Should these products be treated as insurance with proper reserves? Should the buyer have an insurable interest and have to suffer actual losses or deliver the reference assets? How do we make sure credit protection does not undermine credit research or lead creditors to push debtors into bankruptcy? Should they even exist if not traded on an exchange? Someone has to bear the risk of every financial transaction so we must not allow the wizards of finance to pretend it has disappeared. Finally, just like with banks, we must eliminate the opportunity to avoid or choose favorable regulators or regulations. Similar activity must be regulated the same way by the same regulator. Otherwise, firms will be able to game the system, and regulators will not be able to effectively enforce the rules. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING

"Senator Crapo","I do, if I could, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Please.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","First of all, Mr. Chairman, let me thank you for holding this hearing. I believe that although there is a breadth of derivative action in our economy, I believe that a significant amount, if not the significant majority of the amount of those transactions falls under the jurisdiction of this Committee, and I appreciate your attention to that fact. I also agree with the comments that both the Chairman and Ranking Member have made. Recent events in the credit markets have highlighted the need for greater attention to risk management practices, and counterparty risk in particular; and although I agree with the need to focus on where we can standardize and the types of risk reduction and better practices that we need to address, I also want in my remarks to just focus very quickly on one specific part of it, and that is, not letting the pendulum swing too far to the other side to where we cause damage to an efficient economy. The creation of clearinghouses and increased information to trade information warehouses are positive steps to strengthen the infrastructure for clearing and settling credit default swaps. While central counterparty clearing and the exchange trading of simple standardized contracts has the potential to reduce risk and increase market efficiency, market participants must be permitted to continue to negotiate customized bilateral contracts in over-the-counter markets. Many businesses use over-the-counter derivatives to minimize the impact of commodity price, interest rate, and exchange rate volatility in order to maintain stability in earnings and predictability in their operations. If Congress overreaches or bans or generates significant uncertainty with regard to the legitimacy of decisions to customize individual OTC derivatives transactions, I believe there could be very significant negative implications on how companies manage risk. In the contemplation of this hearing and this issue, Mr. Chairman, I actually requested that a number of the end users of these types of transactions respond to a question about what increased flexibility or reduction of flexibility would do, and at this time, I would like to just share three or four examples of the responses that I received. David Dines, the President of Cargill Risk Management, indicates, ``While margining and other credit support mechanisms are in place and utilized every day in the OTC markets, there is flexibility in the credit terms, the credit thresholds and types of collateral that can be applied. This flexibility is a significant benefit for end users of OTC derivatives such as Cargill in managing working capital. Losing this flexibility is particularly concerning because mandatory margining will divert working capital from investments that can grow our business and idle it in margin accounts. While it depends on market conditions, the diversion of working capital from Cargill for margining could be in excess of $1 billion. Multiply this across all companies in the United States and the ramifications are enormous, especially at a time when credit is critically tight.'' Kevin Colgan, the Corporate Treasurer of Caterpillar: ``Our understanding of currently pending regulation in this area is that it would require a clearing function which would standardized terms like `duration' and `amount.' Any standardization of this type would prohibit us from matching exactly the terms and underlying exposure we are attempting to hedge. Thus, in turn it would expose us to uncovered risk and introduce needless volatility into our financial crisis.'' I have a number of other examples which I will insert for the record, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR MIKE CRAPO
"Chairman Reed","Without objection.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","And if possible, I would like the permission of the Committee to insert the letters that I received in response to these inquiries into the record. I may get another in the next couple of days. The bottom line, Mr. Chairman, is I completely agree with the need to do as much as we can to assure that we have covered the risks in our economy that have been created by the utilization of these types of derivatives, the different types of derivatives, credit default swaps, for example. I just believe that we want to pay very careful attention to making sure that we do what is necessary to protect and strengthen our markets and that we leave flexibility where it is necessary and helpful for the utilization of these credit instruments to advance the interests of our businesses.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Crapo. I think you have illustrated the challenges ahead very well in terms of that balance. Senator Bennet, do you have an opening statement?",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","I do not, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding the hearing, and I am very appreciative that the witnesses are here.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Senator Johanns, do you have an opening statement?",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","I do not. I am ready for witnesses.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. Let me at this juncture introduce our witnesses. We are very pleased to be joined today first by the Honorable Mary Schapiro, Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to becoming SEC Chairman, she was CEO of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, FINRA, the largest nongovernmental regulatory for all securities firms doing business within the United States. Chairman Schapiro previously served as a Commissioner of the SEC from December 1988 to October 1994 and then as Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission from 1994 until 1996. Thank you, Chairman. Next is the Honorable Gary Gensler. Gary Gensler is the Chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. He previously served at the U.S. Department of the Treasury as Under Secretary of Domestic Finance from 1999 to 2000 and as Assistant Secretary of Financial Markets from 1997 to 1999. Prior to joining the Treasury, Chairman Gensler worked for 18 years at Goldman Sachs, most recently as a partner and cohead of finance. Our third witness is Ms. Patricia White, Associate Director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. Ms. White has oversight responsibilities for sections that analyze risk and process microeconomic data, and she has participated in domestic and international working groups on central counterparties, securities settlement, and financial regulation. I very much thank all of you joining us here this afternoon, and, Chairman Schapiro, would you begin your testimony?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you very much, Chairman Reed. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to testify on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the regulation of over-the-counter derivatives. The severe financial crisis that has unfolded over the last 2 years has revealed serious weaknesses in the structure of U.S. financial regulation. One of these gaps is the gap in regulation of OTC derivatives, which under current law are largely excluded or exempted from regulation. The current regulatory framework has permitted certain opaque securities-related OTC derivatives markets to develop outside of investor protections afforded by the securities laws. The SEC is committed to working closely with this Committee, the Congress, the Administration, and our fellow regulators to close this gap and restore a sound structure for U.S. financial regulation. I am pleased to be able to report to you that U.S. regulatory authorities have reached a broad consensus on the pressing need for a comprehensive regulatory framework for OTC derivatives. This consensus covers all of the basics of sound financial regulation in the 21st century, including record keeping and report requirements, appropriate capital and margin requirements, transparent and efficient markets, clearing and settlement systems that monitor and manage risk, business conduct and disclosure standards to protect the interests of market participants, and vigorous enforcement against fraud and other wrongdoing. The SEC is also strongly supportive of ongoing initiatives to promote the standardization and central clearing of OTC derivatives. The SEC, working in closing consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, and operating under the parameters of the current legislative structure, already has taken a number of actions to help further centralized clearing for OTC derivatives, including providing temporary conditional exemptions for three central counterparties to begin centrally clearing credit default swaps. More needs to be done, however, and in building a new regulatory framework for OTC derivatives, it is vital that the system be designed to protect the public interest, manage systemic risk, and promote capital formation and general economic welfare. Treasury Secretary Geithner's May 13th letter to the congressional leadership outlined the Administration's plan for establishing a comprehensive framework for regulating OTC derivatives. Multiple Federal regulatory agencies will play critical roles, including those represented here today. In fashioning a regulatory framework for OTC derivatives, it is crucial to recognize the close relationship between the regulated securities and futures markets and the now mostly unregulated markets for OTC derivatives. For example, with respect to the securities markets, when an OTC derivative references an issuer of securities, such as a public company or a security itself, it can be used to establish synthetic long or short exposures to an underlying security or group of securities. In this way, market participants can replicate the economics of either a purchase or sale of securities without purchasing or selling the securities themselves. Because market participants can use these securities-related OTC derivatives to serve as synthetic substitutes for securities, the markets for these OTC derivatives are interconnected with the regulated securities markets. Moreover, the markets for these securities-related OTC derivatives implicate the policy objectives for capital markets that Congress has set forth in the Federal securities laws, including investor protection, the maintenance of fair and orderly markets, and the facilitation of capital formation. For this reason, it is important that Congress carefully consider whether securities-related OTC derivatives should be subject to the Federal securities laws so that the risk of arbitrage and manipulation is minimized. And, certainly, a similar analogy can be made to the futures markets by the CFTC. My goal today is to assist the Congress in its efforts to craft legislation that empowers the respective regulatory authorities to do their jobs effectively and cooperatively. I am confident that, working together, we will meet the challenge that is so important to the financial well-being of individual Americans. I would be pleased to answer your questions. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MARY L. SCHAPIRO, CHAIRMAN, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Chairman Schapiro.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, other Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here to talk to you today about the over-the-counter derivatives market. I would like my full testimony to be entered into the record, if that is all right. I, too, am speaking on behalf of the full Commission. I believe we must urgently move to bring the over-the- counter derivatives marketplace under regulation, and there are four key objectives in accomplishing this goal. One is to lower systemic risk. Two, we need to provide the transparency and efficiency to these markets that we believe we have in our securities and futures and options markets. Three, we need to ensure integrity in these markets, preventing fraud, manipulation, and other abuses. And, four, we need to protect the retail public in these markets as we do in other markets we oversee. Meeting these objectives will also require close coordination between the CFTC, SEC, and other Federal regulators. Senators, I believe that we must establish a regulatory regime that governs the entire over-the-counter marketplace, no matter who is trading them, what type of derivative is traded, whether it is standardized, tailored, or highly customized. I think this should include interest rate product, currency product, commodity product, equities product, credit default swaps, and those swaps that we have not yet thought of that are just a blip on the horizon. As the Administration laid out in its May 13th letter, I believe this can best be accomplished with two complementary regimes: one to regulate the derivative dealers, or the actors, so to speak; and another regime to regulate the big market functions, or the stages upon which the actors perform their duties. For the dealers in this marketplace--the large financial institutions--we should set capital standards and margin requirements to help lower the risk in the system. We should set business conduct standards to make sure that the market is free from fraud, manipulation, and other abuses. And, third, we should set record keeping and reporting, with audit trails, so that we have transparency. So lower risk, promote market integrity, and enhance transparency. But I think this dealer regime will not really be enough. It is important, and it gets all the markets customized and standardized. We can further lower risk by having central clearing on standardized products, and also bringing the standardized products onto regulated trading venues, whether they be full exchanges or electronic platforms. This will lower risk and further enhance transparency. To fully achieve these objectives, we must enact both of these complementary regimes. Regulating both the traders and the trades will ensure that we cover both the actors and the stages upon which they create the significant risks. I am fortunate to have a partner in this effort in SEC Chair Mary Schapiro. She brings invaluable expertise that gives me great confidence that we will be able to work together on what is bound to be many challenges moving forward. We will also work together to advise Congress and the rest of the Administration on how we can best harmonize some of the rules between the securities and futures world and cover gaps in our regulatory oversight. President Obama has called for action to strengthen market integrity, lower risk, and protect investors, and I look forward to working with Members of this Committee and others in Congress to accomplish this goal. I thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to answering any of your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF GARY GENSLER, CHAIRMAN, COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Chairman Gensler.",Speech,
"Ms. White","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and other Members of the Subcommittee, I appreciate this opportunity to provide the Federal Reserve Board's views on the development of a new regulatory structure for the over-the-counter, or OTC, derivatives market. The events of the last 2 years have demonstrated the potential for difficulties in one part of the financial system to create problems in other sectors and in the macroeconomy broadly. Centralized clearing of standardized OTC products is a key component of efforts to mitigate such systemic risk. The Board believes that moving toward centralized clearing for most or all standardized OTC products would have significant benefits. If properly designed and overseen, central counterparties, or CCPs, offer an important tool for managing counterparty credit risk. The benefits from centralized clearing will be greatest if CCPs are structured so as to allow participation by end users within a framework that ensures protection of their positions and collateral. Infrastructure changes in OTC markets will be required to move most standardized OTC contracts into centralized clearing systems. Such changes include agreement on key terms that constitute standardization and development of electronic systems for feeding data to CCPs. For their part, CCPs must have in place systems to manage the risk from this new business. Of particular importance are procedures to handle defaults because OTC products are likely to be less liquid than the exchange-traded products that CCPs most commonly handle. Although implementation challenges no doubt lie ahead, the Board will work to ensure that these challenges are addressed quickly and constructively. Major dealers have committed to making improvements in back-office systems that are important prerequisites for centralized clearing. Dealers also have committed to clearing standardized OTC products, and they will be expected to demonstrate progress on this commitment even as the broader regulatory reform debate evolves. Substantial progress in improving the transparency of the credit default swap, or CDS, market occurred with the creation of the Trade Information Warehouse, a contract repository that contains an electronic record of a large and growing share of CDS trades. The Board supports creating contract repositories for all asset classes and requiring a record of all OTC derivative contracts that are not centrally cleared to be stored in these repositories. Aggregate data on volumes and open interests should be made public by repositories, and more detailed data should be made available to authorities to support policy objectives related to the prevention of manipulation and systemic risk. Although the creation of CCPs will provide an important new tool for managing counterparty credit risk, enhancements to risk management for individual market participants will continue to be a high priority for supervisors. If the reforms outlined here are implemented, the firms currently most active in bilateral OTC markets will become the firms most active as clearing members of CCPs. As such, the quality of their internal risk management is important to the CCP. Supervisory efforts are already underway to improving collateralization practices and to examine whether the current capital regime can be improved. Policy issues associated with OTC derivatives are not limited to the United States. The markets are global, and issues are unlikely to be fully addressed without international coordination. Much work must be done, but with effective oversight by supervisors, prudent risk management by end users and dealers, and appropriate changes in the regulatory structure, derivatives can continue to provide significant benefits to businesses and investors who use them to manage financial market risks. Thank you very much. I look forward to answering your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF PATRICIA WHITE, ASSOCIATE DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF RESEARCH AND STATISTICS, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. This is an issue of great complexity and great importance, and so this is the beginning of a process, I think, not the conclusion of one, in trying to determine what Congress must do and will do to provide adequate regulation for a complicated part of our financial markets. Let me begin by saying that one aspect that we have to get right is to cover the whole waterfront, if you will, to make sure that there are no gaps, that there is an effective and efficient way to do this, and I wonder if all of you in turn could give your comments about how we ensure there is a comprehensive approach, that we don't create these areas where there is an opportunity to operate outside of the framework. We will start with Chairman Schapiro.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I agree with you completely that it is really important that as we seek to solve the existing gaps, we not create any additional ones. So I think there are several mechanisms for that. The first is to encourage and use the tools like capital and margin, standardization and central clearing, to the greatest extent possible and even encourage exchange trading of currently OTC derivatives. That will give us, as Chairman Gensler said, some control over the stage and it will allow us to have a centralized view of what is happening in these markets and the benefits of capital and margin requirements with respect to those institutions. But it is also critically important that we have regulation of the dealers who participate in the marketplace, meaning, in my view, registration, capital requirements, margin requirements, record keeping, reporting to regulators, reporting at least aggregated information to the public, and very tight risk management processes within the dealers, including governance, risk controls, trading limits, all of the things we would normally think about as being important for dealers to control the risks that they are undertaking. I also think that whether we have a systemic risk regulator at the end of this process or a council or a combination as in the Administration proposals, it will be very important for the regulators to share as much information on a continuing basis as possible so that as new products are being developed, and I am sure that as we sit here, somebody is developing a new product that perhaps falls between the regulators' current authorities, that we know about those products as quickly as possible, understand their implications for the system, and bring them under the Federal regulatory umbrella, either by moving that into a central clearinghouse or exchange platform or through the regulation of the dealers who participate in those transactions on a bilateral basis.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Gensler","",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I think that Chair Schapiro summed it up well, but I think, if I might say, one of the great lessons out of this financial crisis is that we had large financial institutions that were, by and large, outside of the regulatory regime. I mean, some had ineffective Federal oversight, but AIG is Exhibit A, and I think, frankly, the derivative dealers that were affiliated with Lehman and Bear Stearns and others were only modestly regulated. I think we all now feel we have to bring them under regulation. By regulating the dealers, we get nearly 100 percent of the marketplace. It would be possible to be outside this regulation. Senator, if you and I entered into a derivative contract, neither one of us is a dealer. But any dealer that holds themselves out to the public and offers these types of transactions, I think we can lower risk by having the capital and margin requirements, and increase transparency with record keeping reporting. We can let the tens of thousands of users of these products take greater comfort by regulating the stages, or moving the standard products onto exchanges and onto central clearing while at the same time recognizing there will still be some tailored products. There could be an airline company that needs a certain grade of jet fuel delivered in a certain location on a certain day. That would still be regulated because the dealer offering that product would have to put aside capital and margin and not participate in manipulation and fraud. Accordingly we allow some customization so the tens of thousands of users could still use those products.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Well, thank you. In Senator Crapo's comments and your comments, there seems to be a range of real economic arrangements. I mean, there is a specific thing. They need the fuel on a certain day. They are hedging a certain price. And there is a whole category, as Chairman Schapiro said, of synthetics that are mimicking the Dow, that are more sort of the creations and almost an infinite supply of them. Is that one dimension that you would consider in terms of putting items on an exchange?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I believe, Mr. Chairman, that anything that a clearinghouse would accept for clearing under prudent risk reduction should be accepted for clearing as standardized. The regulators could also be given authority, working with Congress, to list additional contracts as standardized such as a high-volume product or similar product, so that customization it is not just used to avoid centralized clearing. I also believe that those products that are not on central clearing and not on exchanges are by their definition less liquid and thus should appropriately have higher capital or margin requirements. So if a dealer wants to retain that customized product, it might have to meet higher capital requirements or require higher margin from their customers.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Chairman Schapiro.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I would just add to that that one of the benefits of higher capital and margin might be to encourage more transactions into central clearing or onto exchanges. But I do think the challenge will be standardization and how do we achieve a significant proportion of this market moving into central clearing. There was clearly a need for customized bilateral transactions, as Senator Crapo has said and as Chairman Gensler has mentioned. The key thing is that they be brought into the regulatory umbrella through the regulation of the dealers and that there is adequate margin for those positions and adequate capital on behalf of the dealers, and again, the regulators have the ability to see what is happening between counterparties.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Before I recognize Senator Bunning, Ms. White, do you have a comment?",Speech,
"Ms. White","The Board has been focusing on the aspects of the market that relate to systemic risk and how to fill gaps there, and in particular what infrastructure would be helpful. One thing we would like to point to is the creation of Trade Information Warehouses for all asset classes and all contracts. That will provide an important base of knowledge for the authorities as they try to evaluate what is standardized enough to next move into a cleared environment. In addition, I would want to add that in terms of gaps, it is important to keep in mind that these are really international markets and we are going to need a lot of international coordination to make sure all the gaps are filled.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I said in my statement, I think similar activities should be regulated the same way by the same regulator. In other words, we need just one regulator for derivative products. Do you agree or disagree with that statement? Go right ahead.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you. I think my greater concern than having a single regulator for all derivative products is disconnecting securities-related derivatives from securities markets, because as I go on to probably in too great length in my written statement, the concern is that you can create a synthetic securities position utilizing derivative products that are intimately tied to the securities markets for which we have primary concern. They are important for capital formation. They are important to millions of investors in the United States. And so the impact that these securities derivatives can have on the primary securities market is a concern that I would hate to see be decoupled. It has been, as many derivatives have been decoupled from their primary markets over the last 15 or 20 years or so. But I think, to me, that is the more important linkage, is between the securities derivatives and the securities markets, and the same would be true for the markets that CFTC regulates.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Go right ahead.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I think, Senator, you raise a very important point. We have two market regulators--the securities and options markets that the SEC regulates and the futures markets that the CFTC regulate. Now we are bringing this market of derivatives, hopefully, with Congress' help, under regulation. Derivatives have a lot of attributes of securities and a lot of attributes of futures. In some cases derivatives have more attributes toward futures on those products, I think we have broad agreement, that they would be best regulated by the CFTC. Some are far more similar to securities and can clearly influence the markets for an individual company's stock or be used in insider trading. That would really be an area where the SEC can best protect the investor. So I think working together and with this Committee and Congress as a whole, we aren't going to leave any gaps, but recognize that these derivatives have attributes sometimes more similar to securities and sometimes more similar to futures. Under your basic concept----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, I am trying to prevent any from slipping through the cracks.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","And we, I think, both agree with that goal, and I think we can achieve that goal together.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Ms. White, does the Fed have some opinion on this?",Speech,
"Ms. White","The products in the market have a lot of diversity to them and both the CFTC and the SEC will bring different skills to the regulatory oversight of those products. For the Board, what is most important is that we try to avoid jurisdictional overlaps and harmonize the treatment of products.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Senator, if I could just add one point there----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Go ahead.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I think that where you have products that are effectively economic substitutes for each other under the jurisdiction of different regulators, it is really critical that we work as closely as we can to try to harmonize our regulatory regimes.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","But isn't that where we failed in the last 15 years?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Well, except that with respect to most over- the-counter derivatives, they have been exempted from or excluded from virtually all regulation.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","But that is because we have had two Chairmen of the Federal Reserve who said to us at the Banking Committee that they shouldn't be regulated. I can go back and get you the testimony----",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Oh, I am sure that is right. That is certainly not the position of the Securities and Exchange Commission. We believe that these products absolutely should be regulated and need to be regulated effectively because of the impact that they can have on the economy broadly, but also on particular markets, like the equity market.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","There seems to be agreement that all derivatives need to be reported to someone. Who should the trades be reported to, and what information is necessary to be reported, and is there any information that should not be available to the public? Anybody?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Senator, I think that we need to bring a great deal more transparency to the markets, and I think this will actually lower the pricing for the tens of thousands of users. What we have found over many decades is that when you have greater transparency, markets are more efficient. All of the products that dealers trade in should be reported into a central trade repository that regulators can monitor so that we can police for fraud and manipulation. The public should also get to see anything that could be on an exchange or a trading platform. I fully subscribe to what Secretary Geithner's letter says. There should be a real-time reporting, a development of sort of like a consolidated tape very similar to what is in the over-the-counter bond market----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","What do we do about the derivative or credit default swap or that individual, personalized hedge? Use Delta Airlines as an example and the delivery at a certain date at a certain price and that personalized derivative that they use for hedging against the market.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I believe, sir, that that should be reported to all the regulators and certainly aggregated in the aggregate positions by underlying commodity. In that way, jet fuel derivatives should be reported to the public. I think working together, we have to think through whether that should also be part of this consolidated tape or whether there are some that would be so unique that the commercial attributes of, as you said, Delta Airlines might be put at risk. But they, I believe, should be----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I think----",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","----aggregated in part, seen clearly by the regulators, and possibly be part of the consolidated tape.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I can't see how Delta Airlines would be put at risk if they are smart enough to hedge against the market's advance in future oils or future jet fuel or whatever it might be----",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Right, and in that case, I would recommend that it be part of that consolidated tape. But I recognize there may be some transactions----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Bunning.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just had a couple of questions. The first goes back to this question of the clearing of centralized contracts versus customized contracts, because on both the Agriculture Committee and the Banking Committee, we have had some similar conversations, and I heard you today, Chairman Gensler, talk about how, well, it might be OK if we can't put the customized on a centralized clearinghouse because we will have different capital requirements, I think, or some capital requirements, which I think makes a great deal of sense. My question is what, as you think about this--all of you think about this--what incentives there might be, if any, for people to structure around the clearinghouse for no good business purpose. I mean, what really would the incentives be to create a customized hedge here that didn't have a business purpose of some kind?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I would hope that once there is a fully running central clearinghouse, there would be great benefits to moving all the transactions that a dealer could into clearing because it does lower risk for them, instead of having this interconnected spider's web. One of the lessons we learned is not only are institutions too big to fail, but they are too interconnected to fail. Centralized clearing helps lower their risk, and that is why I subscribe to maybe lower capital or margin. But it may well be that some dealers don't agree with my point of view and that they would want to keep some product outside of that standardized central clearing. I think that clearing actually would help lower risk for their institutions and lower risk for the system. Also, it would enhance transparency. The public would see it if it were on an exchange or trading platform. It may well be that some dealers would like to keep the information advantage, but many decades of markets have taught that broad commerce and the economy benefit by having that type of information. And if you see the standard transaction in jet fuel--we were talking about jet fuel--if you see the standard transaction in jet fuel or interest rates--it could be a very plain vanilla interest rate--and I think the small municipality or the small hospital that wants to hedge a four-and-a-half- year interest rate instead of a 5-year interest rate would benefit by seeing that on an open and transparent exchange.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","Do either of you----",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","The only thing I can think of is the informational advantage that one has from not trading in a transparent market and the benefits, to the extent there are some, of anonymity. That is why I think it is so important that the dealer regulation include full transparency, at least to the regulators, and then over time, a decision, I think, by regulators about how much information needs to be made publicly available. I think what is really critical is that we not structure the regulatory regime in any way that creates unintended incentives to go off exchange or off central clearing and stick with bilateral contracts.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","I completely agree with that, and I think that as we proceed here with this and much of the other regulation that we are talking about, we need to be very careful that we aren't creating perverse incentives that end up doing more harm than good. I was just trying to scratch my head to think about--I get the point on transparency, but on the other hand, if it is reported to the regulator, I am not sure there is much of an issue, but we will keep working on it. The other question I had, and it may go back to the systemic risk regulator proposals that we have seen in the last week or so around here, you talked, Chairman Gensler, about the swap that hadn't yet been invented and I started to sweat again about what we might be facing, because the American people are so tired of having us look in the rearview mirror and say what happened while there is all this carnage out there. And I just wondered whether, on a going forward basis, all of you felt that we were going to be in a better position, not to predict the future necessarily, but in a better position to monitor when things are starting to move in a certain way in our financial markets. My understanding, for example, is that between 2000 and 2008, the number of over-the-counter derivatives contracts grew by 522 percent, but during that time, our regulatory authorities had little power to examine any of that. I wasn't here to know whether you asked Congress for that or not. But prospectively, is this some of the work that this council is meant to do? How are we going to keep track of these swaps that have no name?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I think, as it relates to over-the-counter derivatives, that the Federal regulators should have broad authority. If somebody holds themselves out to the public as a dealer, whether it is in the known derivatives, from interest rates to securities to credit default swaps, or something that is not yet known, we should work together to make sure the statute gives broad authority to also bring that into this regulatory regime. I think that is important. It is one of the big lessons of the past, certainly that I have learned. I think in terms of a systemic regulator, what the Administration has put forward is to make sure that the largest financial institutions, those that are either interconnected or by scale or scope, that can affect the American public have to be under prudential regulation, meaning you can set capital and margin and so forth. And I think that is very important.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","The only thing I would add to that is in addition to the systemic regulator, the continuing role of the functional regulators, the SEC and the CFTC, or bank regulators looking at the business of the dealers in a way that really we have never been able to before because of the exemptions that exist under existing law, ought to make a big difference in our ability to understand what kind of products are being developed and marketed, and I think the business conduct rules that really try to get to how these derivative products might be marketed and sold, whether to State and local governments or pension funds or even less sophisticated institutions, will give us real insight into what is happening within the firms and the ability, hopefully, to shut down problematic practices before they grow out of control.",Speech,
"Senator Bennet","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thanks, Senator Bennet.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Each of you in your testimony have indicated, as I indicated in my opening remarks, that there are circumstances in which nonstandard products are very legitimate and that there are legitimate reasons for us to engage in customized transactions. Obviously, the question that I am interested in here today is how do we make sure that we regulate to the extent possible in such a way that makes certain that we don't basically engender greater inefficiencies and risk in our economy as a result of the way we treat these types of customized transactions? As I have read your testimony, Ms. White, for example, indicates that these nonstandard products can pose significant risk management challenges because they can be complex, opaque, illiquid, and difficult to value, and in your testimony, Chairman Schapiro, you indicate that one way to deal with these nonstandard types of arrangements is to impose appropriate margin and capital requirements on the participants in these customized transactions to reflect the risk that they pose to the system in general. The question I have when we get to that point is do these-- can we evaluate the level of risk that these transactions pose? I think that you would each agree with me that as we have watched derivatives operate in the last few years, that there have been some incredible abuses that have put incredible systemic risk in our economy, but there have also been a phenomenal number of very effective uses of credit default swap and of other derivatives that have helped to create efficiencies and strength in our economy. So the question I am getting at is can we evaluate these nonstandard arrangements in such a way that we can tell whether they are truly generating risk that should then be subjected to greater margin and capital requirements?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I think we can. Can we do it perfectly? Probably not, but I think through imposing risk limits on dealers, stress testing, ensuring that the margin levels are sufficiently conservative and high and stress tested so that we can have some comfort about that, requiring operational controls, it is things as simple as separation of duties and trading limitations on individual traders, requiring that they have robust compliance systems, that the firms have credit policies that they are required to know their counterparty and understand the risks of a bilateral arrangement with that particular counterparty. I think through real vigilance on the part of dealers, which will come mostly with real vigilance on the part of the regulators overseeing the dealer conduct, I think we can certainly do a much better job than has been done historically.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Mr. Gensler.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I think we can. It certainly poses challenges. Much of the marketplace is standardized. There are various estimates, and I haven't seen any very good data, but more than half of the market is certainly standardized and some would say a lot more. Even on the tailored or customized side, sometimes it is just that it is 1 month off. But on the truly exotic, you know, if it is highly customized, I think it will be appropriate to have higher capital and higher margin standards for that dealer. You mentioned the letter earlier from Caterpillar. I think they could absolutely customize and make sure that they hedge their risk. But if their risk is a little different than the standard, well, it is probably almost the same capital. But if their risk is really quite different, then it is hard to value that risk, and the dealer on the other side might have to put up even more capital in that regard. But risk, if I might say, is risk. If it is really highly standardized, we want to make sure that dealers have enough cushion in tough markets to survive.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","So are we saying, then, that our inability to standardize the risk means that the risk is higher?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, it generally does mean that. It is not always the case, but generally, if you can't standardize a product or you don't see other people trading in that product, that risk is a little harder to unwind--it is not a technical term. If a commercial enterprise wants to enter into a transaction and standardize it, it probably means there are 10 or 20 or maybe hundreds of other parties that want to either speculate on that risk or hedge that risk. The greater difficulty is when there is no other party on the other side, and frankly, that is also the problem in crisis, when there are no other parties to take the other side.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. White","",Speech,
"Ms. White","The Board believes that there is value in these nonstandardized products, but it also recognizes that there are challenges in managing the risk associated with a nonstandardized product, both from the standpoint of the firms and from the standpoint of the supervisors. Clearly, improvements need to be made, and there are projects already underway in the supervisory community evaluating, for example, the appropriateness of the capital standards associated with them to make sure that the capital charges attached to nonstandardized products fully reflect the risks of those products.",Speech,
"Senator Crapo","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Crapo.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Let me thank the witnesses for being here. Chairman Gensler, let me follow up on some things that Senator Crapo was asking, and I will be very blunt. Your testimony worries me. So if I have a very standardized product, it is going to go through this system lightning speed. We are going to know exactly what the rules are. But if I have a little bit or maybe even significantly different product, it is going to hit a barrier, because you are going to have to analyze the risk. Some bureaucracy is going to have to shake it and bake it and figure it out and discuss it. And then somebody is going to have to say, well, it is not standardized, and, therefore, it has got to be XYZ in terms of the capital requirement. Isn't that kind of what you are getting us to?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Senator, I appreciate your concern. What we are recommending is that clear rules of the road would be put out by the regulators that are best at setting capital. For these dealers, it is most likely going to be either their bank or other prudential. In some cases it would be the Securities and Exchange Commission or possibly the systemic regulator. Those capital standards set by rule would be set out for customized and standardized products as well. So I would not envision a trade-by-trade circumstance or a contract-by-contract, as you asked.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","No, but the nature of this system and the reason why it got some legs underneath it is because it was so darn adaptable. Now, in the end, that had its downside, too, and then you add stupidity to it, and greed, and it really went south. But as Senator Crapo points out, many companies and, therefore, many shareholders got great benefit from this process. And it seems to me that if you run into anything that is not standardized, you run into the bureaucracy.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I appreciate your concern and I share that concern, but I think that through clear rules of the road, the Federal regulators can lay out what capital and margin is appropriate for the customized products. I do believe that we benefit as an economy and a society that commercial enterprises can hedge their risks and focus on producing a product or a service for the public. That is what the CFTC has been overseeing for decades in the agriculture, energy, and financial markets. I think we have to promote that, but at the same time recognize that if it is not standardized, it might be appropriate to have a little higher margin and higher capital, but set, again, by a public process where you do not have to come in and check each contract.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","OK. What if I am a competitor and you have gone through your process, however long it takes, and you have now set the new capital requirements, and I want to challenge that and appeal it because I think your capital requirements are too low. Are we going to have--will I have the benefit to do that? Can I slow the process down even further?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I think it will probably be--it might not be the CFTC, but it might be the Federal Reserve or the SEC that is setting capital in this regime, so I would defer to----",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Chairman Schapiro.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I guess I would like to add that even the practice today among counterparties is to analyze the risk of our doing business with each other and to demand collateral against the position that they are creating. So much of that analysis that would be required here is an analysis that I think the dealers are very comfortable doing. The difference would be that there would be----",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Government oversight.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Government oversight, but not--I do not think we will have the capacity to second-guess every transaction and whether the risk was analyzed appropriately. But we would expect the firms to stress test their models and to ensure that their risk management procedures were really first class. The difference, I think, will be that there will be capital standards, as there already are for banks and broker-dealers, that will help them, given what their risk analysis shows, determine what the appropriate level of capital is to hold against those positions or potentially the appropriate level of collateral or margin to seek with respect to each transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","I am running out of time. We never have enough time in a hugely complicated area, but let me ask this question: As AIG was ramping up its exposure and risk--and hindsight is always 20/20, and we can look back and say, Boy, that was really dumb. What about your system would have stopped that? Would your system have kicked in at some point and you would call the CEO of AIG and say, ``Whoa, you are at $200 billion,'' or whatever, ``you are done. You are out of the marketplace. You cannot do this anymore''? Would we have stopped AIG?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Senator, it is always hard in hindsight, but I think that a number of features here would have slowed down and maybe even stopped it. AIG put on an enormous book of business without putting aside capital or margin. And what happened just last fall, when the rating agencies downgraded AIG, all of a sudden they had to post significant collateral. I think it was over $30 billion within a day or two. They would have to have done that across the daily basis. It is a harsh discipline, I know. It is one that I learned when I was in the investment banking business. But it is one I think is an important one--to value on a daily basis or weekly basis the risks that a firm has and put aside appropriate capital margin, and AIG was not doing that. There were a lot of other problems in AIG as well that I think the system would have highlighted earlier.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Senator Johanns, we are going to do another round.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","OK, great.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Because you are right, this is a complex topic, and we are extraordinarily fortunate to have the Chairmen and Ms. White from the Federal Reserve. Let me just ask one question, though, and that is: We are engaged in a very complicated regulatory reform process which is going to touch many, many different areas. So I would ask you to just tell us what do you believe are the two or three most important legislative changes that we have to enact given the fear that it is going to be so big and so broad that every detail will be considered. But we need to know what you think the most important priorities are in terms of the legislative changes. Chairman Gensler, you seemed poise to answer.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","I was poised to let Chair Schapiro answer first.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","You know, it is a very appropriate question. It is hard when one's President lays out a bold agenda, and I think it is very bold agenda that President Obama laid out. But I think it is incumbent upon all of us to address over-the- counter derivatives. So if I am allowed two, I would say one priority is absolutely over-the-counter derivatives and protecting the consumers. I mean, the whole approach to having a strong, vigorous oversight of the mortgage--I think the mortgage sales practices in this country failed, failed terribly, all the way through the process of mortgage securitization. But I would say the second big one for me-- there are others, but I would say it is the consumer side.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","I should be more specific. Within the context of regulating over-the-counter derivatives or the derivatives market, any specifics?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Mr. Chairman, it is hard to break it down because I really do think these are complementary regimes. I think that if we are not able to fully regulate the dealers, we will not give the American public the comfort they need, and it will feel like we leave a loophole. If we just did central clearing, which is a good idea, a very good idea, and even if we mandate it, I think we will not have covered the legitimate concern of covering the risk of the customized products.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Well, let me turn to Chairman Schapiro now, but also will there be a definitional debate about who is a CFTC dealer and who is an SEC dealer? Because I think that there is agreement among both of you that the dealers have to be regulated.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I would agree with that, and actually I would go so far as to say that if we do not regulate the dealers, we will realize Senator Bennet's concern that there is not really any reason to go the standardized route because you can really, with anonymity and in a very opaque way, continue to engage in OTC derivatives through unregulated dealers or dealers at least that we cannot adequately examine and inspect. I think that to the extent there are disagreements between the SEC and the CFTC--first of all, most dealers will be regulated by the bank regulators, frankly, and certainly if the Administration's plan to create a systemic risk regulator is effectuated, that systemic risk regulator is likely to regulate, in addition to the functional regulator, any OTC derivatives dealer of any size at all.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Ms. White, do you have a comment?",Speech,
"Ms. White","My portfolio is much narrower than the Chairmen of the two Commissions. But I would point out that we really do think it is important to move on these trade information warehouses so that we have the data for all of the contracts, nonstandardized as well as standardized.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. For the Chairman of the SEC, can and should the Securities and Exchange Commission require all reporting companies to disclose counterparties and reference entities and assets in their derivative portfolios?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Require public disclosure? If their relationships are material and they have material contracts with counterparties, they should be disclosed--at the risk of saying something incorrect here--in their public filings if they are material to the company.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I am talking--you are talking about someone to regulate these people. I am talking about----",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","For example, if Boeing were to enter into a customized----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Customized, or even--yes, a customized one.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","If they were regularly engaged in this market, I think that that should bring them under the umbrella of being regulated. But, otherwise, I believe our view would be that we could get at the information through the dealer's requirement to keep records about counterparties, an audit trail of the transaction, all of the terms of reference of the transaction.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","In other words, I am asking about any entities.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Other than just dealers?",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is correct.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I believe that we think we can get the information through access to all the dealer information about who they were--who their counterparty was.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I am worried about people slipping through, like we had for the last 10 years.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I share that concern very much with you. I think to the extent anybody did not have a dealer as their counterparty, so a Boeing or another commercial company, and they were engaged in this market with any frequency at all, we could get at that directly. But I believe we could get the information very clearly through our regulation of the dealer and access to the complete books and records of the dealer, where they would show that they were transacting with Boeing. And, of course, if the information is in a trade information warehouse or the transaction is done through a central counterparty, we would have access to the information in that method, in that way as well.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","This is one for all of you. How do we prevent a clearinghouse or an exchange from being too big to fail? And should they have access to Fed borrowing?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Senator, I think that we actually already have a number of clearinghouses that have been very well and successfully regulated for decades in the securities, options, and futures markets. But if they were to fail--and they have been successfully regulated--they're systemically relevant already. We are hoping that we will have large clearinghouses for derivatives, so I think all will be somewhat systemically relevant. And we, as you say, will need to sort of address this in statute as to that possibility.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Tell me how.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I think that they should be regulated, as they have been for decades, by the principal----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","The clearinghouses.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","The clearinghouses and exchanges should be regulated by the principal market regulators, as each of our agencies has for decades, and the derivative regulation should embody that similarly. They should be regulated for risk management, making sure they have capital and margining and various practices on how they net the contracts and also regulation about their clearing members. At the same time, I recognize there may be something for the systemic regulators' interest to make sure that if they are going to be called upon in an extreme case to lend money, that they also have some authorities.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","In other words, you would not rule out the Federal Reserve as being a source they could go to in case of emergency?",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I think that--it has never happened, but we cannot rule it out, and we should make sure that--and it is one of the lessons of this crisis, is that we have to make sure that our statutes are up to date so that in an extreme circumstance----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is all we are trying to go through.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Right, so I am agreeing with you, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I do not have much to add to that. I would say that the securities clearinghouses did work very well in the last year over really extraordinary circumstances, but I think the last year also taught us that almost anything can happen that we have not anticipated historically. I think the real key for clearinghouses will be very robust risk management, so that they are very well capitalized, they have effective oversight, and real vigilance from the regulators, whether it is the Fed as a backstop regulator to clearance and payment systems or the functional regulators, the SEC and the CFTC. It will be important for them to have conservative margin requirements and very important for them to have procedures that are well understood, very transparent for how they will resolve the default of a participant in the clearinghouse.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Ms. White, would you like to comment anyway?",Speech,
"Ms. White","The Board believes that CCPs are critical utilities in the financial markets and they need to be regulated and they need to have risk management that would ensure that they carry out their functions in a sound manner. They are, as you pointed out, subject to the possibility of needing liquidity in extreme situations. The Administration has proposed broadening the Fed's ability to provide liquidity in extreme situations, and the Board supports that.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Senator Johanns.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. One of the observations at least that I have made as I look back over the last months is it seems to me the big got bigger, they got more tangled up in so many parts of the economy. Very, very bad decisions were made, and you are off to the races. And then the taxpayer was asked--or told, as in General Motors' case--that, guess what, they bailed them out. If you are adding more regulation, capital requirements, transparency, somebody is going to have to comply with that within the dealer's organization, and there is going to be a cost to that. Where, in your judgment, will the cost of that be borne? I mean, somebody has to pay for it. If it is the airline industry and they are hedging against the rising cost of fuel for their jets, won't consumers pay for that in higher ticket prices?",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","I will take a stab at that. The cost of regulation clearly will ultimately be borne by consumers, and I think that is just a given historically and going forward. It would be my fervent hope that the costs of regulation going forward would pale in comparison to the costs of what we have been through in the last year or two. But it does, I think, point out, very rightfully so, that we have to be sensitive to the costs of the requirements that we may end up proposing----",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","You know, and, Chairman, I am not--gosh, I am not debating that. I think some response to this is absolutely necessary. You know, I am one of the people screaming about General Motors. I thought it was a very bad decision to buy the company. But having said that, we now own it. I would hate to think that we are not doing something here that will protect taxpayers in the future. So that is not even really a debating point. But one of the things I found out as Secretary of Agriculture, once you try to do these overarching regulations and press those down upon the agricultural system, the large operators who had access to capital, et cetera, they tended to survive and get bigger, because they needed to get bigger to pay the cost of the regulations. The small operators went out of business. They just could not endure what you were asking them to endure. And over time you ended up with exactly what we are trying to deal with here, is the big got bigger.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Right. I completely agree with that, and I think we have to be sensitive to costs going forward. One of the segments of our financial services industry that actually weathered the past year reasonably well were smaller and medium-size financial institutions. And so I think it--which shows to me that the diversity of financial institutions in this country is an important safety and soundness feature in and of itself. And I think it is going to be very important for the regulators, as we create a new regulatory structure if Congress empowers that, to be sensitive to costs, particularly those that will be borne by smaller and medium-size businesses that are very important ultimately to access to financial services for millions of Americans who will not be going to the largest dealers.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","If I might, Senator, I am actually quite the optimist at this table. I believe for small firms that this will actually lower costs of doing the standard product. Most small firms hedging an interest rate risk or shipping a product to Europe and want to hedge a currency risk do not have transparency right now. And even a few basis points, which is a hundredth of 1 percent, costs something over the years. I think lending greater transparency to these markets will benefit the many thousands of small businesses and municipalities in this country, particularly on a standard product.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","The transparency is not the issue. You can bring up the transparency and I think everybody would love that. The issue is what they have to deal with every day to try to get their transaction done. And I will just tell you, having worked with overarching regulations, I think in the end you hammer the little guy. It just seems to me that the little guy is going to look at this and say, ``I cannot make it. I do not have enough where I can pass it on to the consumer,'' just like the person with a hundred cows today is struggling to survive. And I just worry that what you are doing here, unless you do something in that area, you are going to put the little guys out of business.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I think that you raise a very important point, and as we work together on this regulation and legislation, I look forward to talking more. I think that they will also greatly benefit by lowering some of the risk and increasing transparency in these markets.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you for your excellent testimony. There may be additional questions that will be submitted to you for the record, and we would ask you to respond in a very timely fashion. But thank you very much, and let me call forward the second panel.",Speech,
"Mr. Gensler","Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Schapiro","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Welcome, gentlemen. Let me introduce our second panel. Our first witness is Dr. Henry Hu, the Allan Shivers Chair in the Law of Banking and Finance at the University of Texas School of Law. His research centers on corporate governance and financial innovation. A 1993 Yale Law Journal article showed how sophisticated financial institutions may make big mistakes as to derivatives. His work on the decoupling of debt and equity rights from economic interests has attracted wide attention, including, coincidentally, a story in the current issue of The Economist. So welcome, Dr. Hu. Thank you. Our next witness is Mr. Kenneth C. Griffin. He is the founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer of Citadel Investment Group, L.L.C., a global hedge fund and asset management firm. Citadel operates in the world's major financial centers, including Chicago, London, New York, Hong Kong, and San Francisco. Mr. Griffin is also a member of several philanthropic boards, including service as Vice Chairman of the Chicago Public Education Fund. Thank you, Mr. Griffin. Our next witness is Mr. Robert G. Pickel. He is the Executive Director and Chief Executive Officer of the International Swaps and Derivatives Association, or ISDA, which is the global trade association for over-the-counter derivatives. Previously, Mr. Pickel was the General Counsel of ISDA, serving in that capacity since November 1997. Prior to joining ISDA, Mr. Pickel was Assistant General Counsel in the Legal Department of Amerada Hess Corporation, an international oil and gas company, from 1991 to 1997. Welcome, Mr. Pickel. Our fourth witness is Mr. Christopher Whalen, the Managing Director of Institutional Risk Analytics, a Los Angeles-based provider of risk management tools, but Mr. Whalen is a proud resident of Croton-on-the-Hudson, New York. They provide consulting services to auditors, regulators, and financial professionals. Mr. Whalen leads the company's risk advisory practice and consults for global companies on a variety of financial and regulatory issues. He is also the regional director of the Professional Risk Managers International Association and is a board adviser Eye on Asia, a global business security and risk consultancy based in Hong Kong. Thank you, Mr. Whalen. Dr. Hu, would you please begin?",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","Mr. Chairman and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, thank you for this opportunity. My name is Henry Hu. I teach at the University of Texas Law School and my testimony reflects my preliminary views as an academic. In the interest of full disclosure, I recently agreed to begin working soon at the Securities and Exchange Commission. I emphasize that I am currently a full-time academic, have been so for over two decades, and after this forthcoming government service will return to my normal academic duties. What I will say today does not reflect the views of the SEC and has not been discussed with, or reviewed by, the SEC. I have submitted written testimony. I ask that it also be included in the record. This is a seminal time for the regulation of over-the- counter derivatives. My understanding is that the Subcommittee wanted me to offer a broad perspective as to undertaking this task instead of analyzing specific elements of the President's proposal. Almost from the beginning of the OTC derivatives markets in the late 1970s, two overarching visions have animated the regulatory debate. The first vision is that of science run amok, of a financial Jurassic Park. In the face of relentless competition and capital market disintermediation, big financial institutions have hired financial scientists to develop new financial products. Often operating in an international wholesale market open only to major corporate and sovereign entities--a loosely regulated paradise hidden from public view--these scientists push the frontier, relying on powerful computers and esoteric models laden with incomprehensible Greek letters. But danger lurks. As these financial creatures are created, evolved, and mutate, exotic risks arise. Not only do the trillions of mutant creatures destroy the creators in the wholesale capital market, they escape to cause havoc in the retail market and economies worldwide. This first vision focuses on the chaos that is presumed to result from the innovation process. The chaos could be at the level of the entire financial system. This motivated, of course, the Federal Reserve's intervention in 1998 of Long-Term Capital Management--perhaps they should have called this hedge fund something else--and the intervention in 2008 as to AIG. There could also be chaos at the level of individual market participants. Witness the bankruptcy of Orange County in 1994, and also in 1994, the huge derivatives losses at Proctor and Gamble--but perhaps that company's name was appropriate. But there is also a second vision, one that is the converse of the first vision. Here, the focus is on the order, the sanctuary from an otherwise chaotic universe made possible by the innovation process. The notion is this. Corporations and others are subject to volatile financial and commodities markets. Derivatives, especially OTC derivatives, can allow corporations to hedge against almost any kind of risk. This allows corporations to operate in a more ordered world. If the first vision is that of a Jurassic Park gone awry, the second vision is that of the soothing, perfect, hedges found in formal English and Oriental gardens. While the first vision focuses on the private and social costs of derivatives, the second vision emphasizes the private and social benefits of OTC derivatives. In fact, there are elements of truth to both visions and the essential task ahead is to try to reduce the costs of such derivatives without losing their benefits. Now, that is easily said. How can we actually accomplish this? Well, in my academic articles on this matter, I stress one theme. We must not just focus on the characteristics of individual OTC derivatives, but also on the underlying process of financial innovation through which products are invented, introduced to the marketplace, and diffused. That is, the financial innovation process itself, not just individual derivatives, has regulatory significance. Because of time limitations, I simply refer to two or three examples, and only very briefly. First, the innovation process can lead to chaos by causing important market participants to make big mistakes. In an article published in 1993 in the Yale Law Journal entitled ``Misunderstood Derivatives,'' I argued that the particular characteristics of the modern financial innovation process will cause even the most sophisticated financial institutions to make big mistakes as to derivatives. Second, the gaps in information as to this innovation process between the regulators and the regulated are extraordinary. Regulators may not even be aware of the existence of certain derivatives, much less how they are modeled or used. And so beginning in 1993, I have urged the creation of a centralized informational clearinghouse as to OTC derivatives. Third, let's focus on one particular example of the innovation process, the so-called ``decoupling'' process. I have--beginning in 2006--been the lead or sole author as to a series of articles suggesting that this decoupling process can affect the core disclosure and substantive mechanisms of our economic system. In the initial 2006 articles, the focus was on the equity side. Those articles showed how you could have an ``empty voter'' phenomenon. For instance, the person holding the highest number of votes in a company could be somebody with no economic interest or a negative economic interest. And similarly, there is a ``hidden morphable ownership'' issue. Those 2006 articles showed how some hedge funds and others have used cash-settled equity swaps in efforts to try to avoid making disclosures under Section 13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In 2007, it suddenly occurred to me that the same kind of decoupling process can work on the debt side. For instance, using credit default swaps, you could have creditors who are ``empty creditors.'' With this empty creditor situation, these creditors might often have weaker incentives than traditionally to make sure that their borrowers stay out of bankruptcy. Indeed, if they hold enough credit default swaps, they might benefit from their borrowers going into bankruptcy. In these times, this is deeply troubling. Let me conclude. Three econometricians went hunting in the wilds of Canada. They were getting hungry and they suddenly see a deer. One econometrician shoots and misses three feet to the right. The second econometrician shoots and misses three feet to the left. The third econometrician doesn't shoot but shouts, ``We got it! We got it!'' It is very difficult to come up with a good model, much less one that would actually put food on the table. The task of coming up with a good model for regulating derivatives is no less difficult, and we now all know that this task is essential to making sure that food is indeed on the table for everyone.

"Chairman Reed","Well, thank you very much, Dr. Hu. Mr. Griffin, please.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","Chairman Reed, Senator Bunning, Members of the Committee, I am Kenneth Griffin, President and CEO of Citadel Investment Group and I appreciate the opportunity to testify and share our views regarding effective oversight of the OTC derivatives market. The appropriate oversight of the OTC derivatives market is of paramount importance to the safety and soundness of our financial system. The events of recent months have made it abundantly clear that large financial firms are not too big to fail, but rather too interconnected to fail. The idea that extreme measures must be taken to prevent the failure of a single firm, such as Bear Stearns, which had just over $10 billion of shareholders' equity and a few thousand employees, drives home the point that greater regulation of our financial markets is warranted. Derivatives serve an incredibly important role in our financial markets. Current notionals exceed several hundred trillion dollars and reflect the important role of these risk transference contracts. The commercial justifications for this market are well established and well understood. Regretfully, as this market has grown to almost unimaginable scale, the regulatory framework and market structure have not kept pace. Now is the time to put an end to the antiquated practice of bilateral trading. The use of central clearinghouses open to all market participants will end the era of too interconnected to fail. The use of central clearinghouses will bring considerable value to society in the form of far greater price transparency; fairer executions for all users of these instruments, and in particular for less frequent users, such as municipalities, smaller corporations, and local banks; far greater ease of regulatory oversight; and reduced responsibility for any systemic risk regulator. In addition, a central clearinghouse will create a stronger regulatory framework for all users, including regional banks, insurance companies, pension plans, and other pools of investment capital. For example, margin requirements and daily mark-to-markets will apply to all users of the clearinghouse. Capital requirements on the trading of derivatives not cleared through a central clearinghouse should reflect the significant systemic risk they create and should be substantially higher than those in existence today. Citadel has a vested interest in seeing this modernization of our financial markets. We and several of the largest asset managers in the world have united behind the CME group in the development of a neutral, open access, central counterparty clearing solution for credit default swaps. As part of a larger community of investors, we are committed to the improvement of the safety and soundness of our financial markets. The commitment of many of the leading buy-side firms to a central clearinghouse reflects the inherent weaknesses in today's dealer-centric bilateral trading model. For example, customers are often required to post initial margin to their counterparties to initiate a trade. These funds are commingled with the dealer's other assets. Because customer margin is not segregated, customer funds could be lost in a dealer default. In times of stress, customers will rush to close out positions to recover their margin. This can intensify a liquidity crisis, as we saw last fall. And last fall, when customers sought to mitigate credit risk by closing out positions with dealers, the prices at which they could terminate contracts were often extremely unfair. Customers do not have access to high-quality market data in today's paradigm, such as transaction prices. This information is closely held and not broadly available. Customers require transaction data and accurate prices to understand the riskiness of their portfolios. Without this information, the ability of customers to prudently manage their portfolios is substantially limited. The large dealers earn extraordinary profit from the lack of transparency in the marketplace and from the privileged role they play as credit intermediaries in almost all transactions. The current market structure suits their interests and leaves their customers at a significant disadvantage. But the memories of AIG, Bear Stearns, and Lehman Brothers, to name a few, should prompt, in fact, demand, a swift and thoughtful response from our regulators and legislators. Today, the vast majority of credit default and interest rate swap contracts have standardized terms and trade in large daily volumes. Arguments have been advanced about the importance of customized derivatives, which represent a small percentage of total activity. Customized derivatives are important, but they come with significant operational risk, model risk, and financial risk. We should permit the continued use of customized derivatives with appropriately heightened regulatory capital requirements and far clearer risk disclosures to nonfinancial institutions and users. In the end, I strongly believe these arguments are nothing more than a strategy to obfuscate the real issues at hand, principally the need to bring much overdue modernization to our marketplace. This problem has an international dimension. We must work to coordinate our actions with foreign regulators. Otherwise, we face the risk of cross-border capital and regulatory arbitrage. The status quo cannot be allowed to continue. We must work together to drive market structure, reform that fosters orderly and transparent markets, that facilitates the growth and strength of the American economy and protects taxpayers from losses, such as those that we have witnessed in the last year. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. I would be happy to answer your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF KENNETH C.

"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Griffin. Mr. Pickel, please.",Speech,
"Mr. Pickel","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee, thank you very much for inviting ISDA to testify today. We are grateful for the opportunity to discuss public policy issues regarding the privately negotiated, or OTC, derivatives business. Our business provides essential risk management and cost reduction tools for many users. Additionally, it is an important source of employment, value creation, and innovation for our financial system. In my remarks today, I would briefly like to underscore ISDA and the industry's strong commitment to identifying and reducing risks in the privately negotiated derivatives business. We believe that OTC derivatives offer significant value to the customers who use them, to the dealers who provide them, and to the financial system in general by enabling the transfer of risk between counterparties. OTC derivatives exist to serve the risk management and investment needs of end users. They include over 90 percent of the Fortune 500, 50 percent of mid-size companies, and thousands of other smaller American companies. The vast majority of these transactions are interest rate and currency swaps and equity and commodity derivatives. These are privately negotiated, bilateral contracts that address specific needs of thousands of companies. We recognize, however, that the industry today faces significant challenges and we are urgently moving forward with new solutions. We have delivered and are delivering on a series of reforms in order to promote greater standardization and resilience in the derivatives markets. These developments have been closely overseen and encouraged by regulators who recognize that optimal solutions to market issues are usually achieved through the participation of market participants. As ISDA and the industry work to reduce risk, we believe it is essential to preserve flexibility to tailor solutions to meet the needs of customers, and the recent Administration proposals and numerous end users agree. Mr. Chairman, let me assure you that ISDA and our members clearly understand the need to act quickly and decisively to implement the important measures that I will describe in the next few minutes. Last week, President Obama announced a comprehensive regulatory reform proposal for the financial industry. The proposal is an important step toward much-needed reform of financial industry regulation. The reform proposal addressed OTC derivatives in a manner consistent with the proposals announced on May 13 by Treasury Secretary Geithner. ISDA and the industry welcomed in particular the recognition of industry measures to safeguard smooth functioning of our markets and the emphasis on the continuing need for the companies to use customized derivatives tailored to their specific needs. The Administration proposes to require that all derivative dealers and other systemically important firms be subject to prudential supervision and regulation. ISDA supports the appropriate regulation of financial and other institutions that have such a large presence in the financial system that their failure could cause systemic concerns. Most of the other issues raised in the Administration's proposal have been addressed in a letter from ISDA that ISDA and various market participants delivered to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York earlier this month. As you may know, a Fed-industry dialogue was initiated under Secretary Geithner's stewardship of the New York Fed nearly 4 years ago. Much has been achieved and much more has been committed to, all with the goal of risk reduction, transparency, and liquidity. These initiatives include increased standardization of trading terms, improvements in the trade settlement process, greater clarity in the settlement of defaults, significant positive momentum central counterparty clearing, enhanced transparency, and a more open industry governance structure. In our letter to the New York Fed this month, ISDA and the industry expressed our firm commitment to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the OTC derivatives markets. As we stated, we are determined to implement changes to risk management, processing, and transparency that will significantly transform the risk profile of these important financial markets. We outlined a number of steps toward that end, specifically in the areas of information transparency and central counterparty clearing. ISDA and the OTC derivatives industry are committed to engaging with supervisors globally to expand upon the substantial improvements that have been made in our business since 2005. We know that further action is required and we pledge our support in these efforts. It is our belief that much additional progress can be made within a relatively short period of time. Our clearing and transparency initiatives, for example, are well underway with specific commitments aired publicly and provided to policy makers. As we move forward, we believe the effectiveness of future policy initiatives will be determined by how well they answer a few fundamental questions. First, will these policy initiatives recognize that OTC derivatives play an important role in the U.S. economy? Second, will these policy initiatives enable firms of all types to improve how they manage risk? Third, will these policy initiatives reflect an understanding of how the OTC derivatives markets function and their true role in the financial crisis? Finally, will these policy initiatives ensure the availability and affordability of these essential risk management tools to a wide range of end users? Mr. Chairman and Committee Members, the OTC derivatives industry is an important part of the financial services business in this country and the services we provide help companies of all shapes and sizes. We are committed to assisting this Committee and other policy makers in its considerations of these very important policy initiatives. I look forward to your questions.

I will be happy to submit that.",Statement,STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER WHALEN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, INSTITUTIONAL RISK ANALYTICS
"Chairman Reed","Just submit it to us, please, Mr. Whalen.",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","I agree with many of the things that have been said in previous testimony and I am very encouraged by what I hear. I hope you will take this as an initial fact finding session today because I think it is important that the Congress build a complete public record on this issue and that will take some time. You have heard a lot about centralized clearing. I don't think anybody is opposed to that. It makes sense. It is part of the evolution of markets. Whenever financial markets start, the first few people who figure out an opportunity never want standardization. They don't want too many people to know what they are doing because they are harvesting the biggest returns that you will ever see in that new market. And over time, as the crowd gets bigger, they all agree that standardization and a certain degree of consistency is important for the participants. This is the way all of our markets have evolved in this country over the last century or more. But I would tell you that I think that clearing is a bit of a canard. I don't think it really is the problem. I think it is part of the problem. It was manifest in many ways over the last few years. I also think that a lot has been said today about information, about a lack of transparency. And again, who disagrees with transparency? It is like motherhood and apple pie. Everybody is for it. But I think in working with our clients and talking through these issues--and my views on these issues have changed over the last 20 years, I will be the first to admit, that is part of the learning process--but I think that everything we deal with today, the systemic risk, the concern that is felt by buy- side investors today who are basically on strike--hinges on valuation. Investors don't want to know about any of these toxic products until the sell side of the street meets their concerns about transparency and price discovery--I particularly appreciate Ken's comments from Citadel. I totally agree with what they are saying. But to me, the basic problem is not with most of the over-the-counter derivatives for currencies or interest rates. These are all fine. They have a visible cash- basis market that everybody can see, the buyer and the seller. Both parties can validate the derivative contract price immediately. Where I think we have a big problem that may not be surmountable is when you allow the investment community to create derivatives where there is no visible cash market. In other words, we are creating the derivative of something that can only be validated with a model. And as we all know, all models are always wrong. They are right at a certain point in time, but if they are not dynamic, the next day, the next week, the next month, it is off base. So I think the key question we have to ask, and this goes back to the basic principles that underlie all of the futures and forward OTC markets in our country, is if you can't see a real price, a cash price and a price that reflects volume, reflects a large community of interest so that that price means something, how do you validate a derivative that is supposedly based on that asset? Classic example, single name credit default swaps. These products essentially let you create a hedge for a corporate bond that is illiquid, or even a completely illiquid loan for that corporation. Now, CDS is a wonderful thing. Everybody in the market agrees, this is a great facility to have, to be able to hedge an exposure with a short position that I can't create in a cash market. I can't borrow that bond to deliver it against a short position. It is illiquid. So we have decided that instead of that price that we don't see, that we can't observe, we are going to use models instead. I think that is a very tenuous, speculative basis for a derivatives market. Now, there may be a certain class of market participants who can participate in such activities, but I think for federally insured banks, for pension funds, for State and local agencies, that is probably a bridge too far. I am a simple guy. I started off in the early, early days of asset swaps and currency swaps working in the London office of Bear Stearns in the mid-1980s. But the beautiful thing about that time is that you never had any question what the swaps were worth. And frankly, I don't even worry about customization. If I have a visible cash basis, I don't mind if someone wants to customize a contract. I don't see what the problem is there. But the problem I do see is that when you allow sophisticated organizations that are a lot smaller than most of us to create vehicles that cannot be validated in the cash marketplace, we have created risk that I think is very, very difficult to address, and particularly for the vast majority of companies and individuals who really are not competent to make investment decisions without professional advice. I have worked as a supervisor of investment bankers, traders, and researchers, and things like suitability and ``know your customer'' mean something to me. I worked for two firms that have very large retail branch networks and we always had to ask ourselves the question when we priced a deal, were we serving the banking customer and were we serving the retail investors that we were going to release securities to when we did a deal. We had a duty to both sides of the trade. And it is that basic element of fairness, not just transparency, not just functionality and risk management, but fairness that I think this Committee has to think about. I look forward to your questions.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Well, thank you very much, gentlemen, for excellent testimony and focusing on a range of issues. Let me start off with asking each one of you, there appears to be a commonality between both the SEC and the CFTC about the need to register dealers as one of the basic starting points for at least partial reform of the system, and we all recognize that this is a long road and a challenging one. So starting with Professor Hu, your sense of the dealer registration. How central is it? Is that one of the top legislative items we should pursue?",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","Yes. I think----",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","If you could put your microphone on, Professor.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","Yes, I think the prudential supervision of dealers is extremely important. I think that the experience with AIG and the decision-making errors that AIG had while acting as a CDS dealer tend to illustrate how it is important for the Federal Government to get involved as to how these decision- making errors can occur. As another example, the government should also consider the payoff structures, including highly asymmetric compensation structures sometimes seen within derivatives units. Sometimes, the rocket scientist gets a big payoff if some product works while, at most, may lose his job if it does not work. One might also ask about the financial literacy of the people who are supposed to be supervising the rocket scientists developing these products? Moreover, when do the risks arise? As we all know, in terms of the derivatives personnel, there tends to be high turnover. The risks may not arise until they are three banks away. So that as part of this process in terms of prudential supervision, I think that we really need to look very carefully in terms of how these errors can arise at ``sophisticated'' derivatives dealers. In fact, there are error issues as well-- and this came up earlier--in connection with end users. In terms of end users, there has been a pattern throughout the history of OTC derivatives of very unsophisticated entities basically gambling and losing. We do not need to even look at the examples of some of today's municipalities getting into trouble as to complex products. There are some famous examples from the late 1980s involving English local councils such as Hammersmith and Fulham. These councils basically decided that the way to keep taxes down is by speculating on interest rates through interest rate swaps. So that I think in terms of this area, certainly one of the things that we ought to look at is the prudential supervision of derivatives dealers and suitability and related sales practice matters. But we also ought to look at the end-user side, including as to the adequacy of end-user disclosures of their derivatives activities and the like. Substantive questions can also arise. What was Procter & Gamble or what was Gibson Greetings doing engaged in LIBOR-squared interest rate swaps? So I think that there are issues all around in this area.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Dr. Hu. Mr. Griffin, please, your comment.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","Thank you. So on the topic of--sorry about that. I would take a step back on the question and ask, ``How do I simplify the regulatory oversight problem as much as possible?'' And central clearinghouses create a tremendous opportunity to reduce the size and scope of the regulatory oversight problem. First of all, the notionals in existence today dramatically overstate the amount of economic risk being transferred, but do not overstate both the operational risk and credit risk inherent in the system. Central clearinghouses will dramatically reduce, because of their inherent netting, the amount of notional risk in the marketplace, and that reduces both operational risk and materially reduces counterparty risk. The market's understanding of cleared products is dramatically higher than the market's understanding of the paper contracts that define the market today. As ISDA pointed out, we have worked on reducing settlement problems in the system today, but we need to go back only a few years to when dealers had weeks and weeks of backlogs of unconfirmed and unprocessed trades--trades that could total into the hundreds of billions of dollars. Trades for which no one had taken the time to ensure were properly recorded on the books and records of the institution. Central clearinghouses with straight through processing eliminate that dramatic operational risk. This will then allow the regulators to focus their efforts around the customized derivatives that do have a role in the dealers' portfolios. It will allow the regulators to spend their time focusing on the handful of contracts for which no standardized solution is appropriate. I believe that our regulators will have the ability and will acquire the abilities over time to find the people to understand the risk in the customized portfolios. To the extent they cannot, those products are not appropriate for regulated institutions to deal in. You cannot call an institution that is regulated ``well regulated'' if no one actually understands the risks inherent in their portfolio other than the 20-some-year-old traders that run the trading floors.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Mr. Pickel and then Mr. Whalen.",Speech,
"Mr. Pickel","Yes, I think what I would focus on in terms of the priority is systemic risk issues, and specifically how do we prevent another AIG type situation? And while regulation of dealers could be helpful in that, I think most importantly is having some window for regulators into risk, and that will be achieved partly by these trade information warehouses that have been talked about, getting the information there where, frankly, all regulators could have access to that, not just a systemic risk regulator but all regulators. And, second, what happened with AIG is many of the counterparties were dealers, and many of them were banks and overseen by banking regulators. They were each building up risk, but nobody was there to connect all the different dots, like a systemic risk regulator could, if established by the Congress, to give that window into risk and to put on the brakes or make changes when they see that risk building up in the system.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. And, Mr. Whalen, your comment?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","I think it is an effective practical question. The chief purpose of regulation should be to focus on things like suitability and the customer-focused issues. Obviously, systems and controls, risk management, all that are very important within a dealer, there is no question. But as I was saying before, there are certain classes of instruments that you really cannot risk manage. You were talking before about an airline that wants to put together a complex, customized swap for fuel. There is no problem with that. Everybody knows what the price of fuel is today. And you do the work, you calculate the optionality in the complex structure, and you can figure out what it is worth. The trouble comes if you look at the subprime complex structured asset market of a couple years ago, that we had everybody in agreement, much like playing Liar's Poker. The model became the definition of value for this class of instruments. But one day a number of people on the buy side started to question that assumption of ``mark-to-model.'' They started backing away from these securities. So did the dealers. So at some point--it is hard to say when--the consensus about value for that class of asset broke down. And that is where we are today. The buy-side customer still does not want to know about securities that have no visible cash market basis and effectively rely upon ``mark-to-model'' for price discovery. So I question really how effective risk management can be in those cases where we do not have a completely separate, independent reference point for value such as a liquid, cash market.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Yes. Messrs. Griffin, Whalen, and Pickel, should parties to derivative contracts be required to post cash collateral? Or is other collateral acceptable? And is there any reason not to require segregation of customer collateral?",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","Senator, I believe that one of the hallmarks of mature markets is a well-functioning margin paradigm where customer assets are segregated. If we look at the futures markets, we have had great success. The CME, for example, in over 100 years, through wars, through the Great Depression, has never had a loss that needed to be mutualized because of their appropriate margin requirements. Now, what should be postable as collateral? At the CME, for example, you can post cash, you can post treasuries, you can post a variety of liquid, well-understood assets as collateral, and that is the right paradigm, in my opinion.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Pickel.",Speech,
"Mr. Pickel","Yes, as far as the types of collateral, I think similarly cash and liquid instruments would be appropriate. There have been discussions about other types of securities that might be taken as collateral, but you would have to have significant haircuts apply to those to even consider them, you know, 50 percent or something, in order to take them in. I think as far as segregation of customer collateral, in the OTC--and I am talking about the customized piece of the business--the use of margin is extensive in that business, and I think that one of the reasons it is used so effectively is that there is an ability to, as I say, rehypotheticate or pass on collateral and use it for your own positions. But I think there is certainly room for greater exploration of segregation of collateral so that customers can have the confidence that when something like a Lehman Brothers situation should happen, they can get a hole of their collateral. So I think there is a lot of focus on that going forward.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Whalen.",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","I agree with the other speakers. Segregation of collateral is one of those evolutions we badly need. But I think the other issue that we ought to touch on briefly. The dealers amongst themselves tend to rely on overarching credit agreements and treaties to deal with all manner of collateral and exposure back and forth; whereas, if you move to an exchange type model, everyone is treated the same and everyone must independently post collateral with the exchange. Whether you are a dealer or a customer, you have different tiers of collateral requirements, but the point is there is a third party who holds the money. You do not have the dealer holding the collateral. You actually have the clearinghouse or a trust company that is separate from the dealer. And I think that is an important distinction.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","This is for anybody. What economic value outweighs the social cost of allowing someone to buy insurance in the form of swaps for assets they do not own? Turn it on, please.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","Ranking Member Bunning, this issue is really very interesting. In terms of credit default swaps, some State insurance regulators have argued that you should not be able to buy credit default swaps unless you have an insurable interest. Well, interestingly, the problems may actually be more complex if you do have an insurable interest than if you did not. Let me explain. When you think about owning a bond or owning a loan and you are a creditor, you traditionally have economic rights, principal and interest; you have various control rights, the various affirmative covenants and negative covenants into a loan agreement or bond indenture; and you have various rights given to you under bankruptcy law, securities law, and other laws. And sometimes you have obligations, too. This is the package of rights that you classically get as a creditor. Now, traditionally and in market practice, you typically assume that it is a single-bundled package. So a borrower is willing to give to the creditor these control rights because he thinks the creditor would like to see it survive to pay back the creditor. Well, in today's world, what if the creditor has lent, say, $100 million and, to conjure up a really extreme example, buys $200 million notional of credit default swaps? This would be an extreme version what in 2007 I called an ``empty creditor.'' This is a really extreme version. It probably does not happen often. But in this extreme example, you would have a creditor who, rather than wanting to work with the borrower for the borrower to avoid bankruptcy, might want to grease the skids to make sure that the person goes into bankruptcy. Now, even if you do not have that extreme situation, problems can arise with an empty creditor. That creditor has much weaker incentives to work with the borrower to avoid bankruptcy. And certainly if a troubled borrower is not aware that the creditor has bought credit default swaps he may not understand the true incentives of the creditor with whom he is negotiating. And if the borrower actually goes into bankruptcy, there are all kinds of complications, disclosure and substantive, that arise within bankruptcy proceedings. Do ``empty creditor'' situations actually happen in the real world? As some of you know, I wrote an op-ed in the April 10 Wall Street Journal about the possible relationship of Goldman Sachs to AIG. There was a really curious incident that--an incident that became curious in retrospect. In September, as you will recall, Lehman had collapsed. AIG was teetering. The Fed felt compelled to intervene to prevent AIG from collapsing. That September 16th, Goldman Sachs said its exposure to AIG was ``not material.'' But come the middle of March, it turns out that of the initial $85 billion of Federal bailout money that AIG received, about $7 billion went to Goldman. Well, how do you reconcile that? That is, Goldman receiving $7 billion, and yet, hey, it had no material exposure to AIG. It turns out, and I suggest in the op-ed, Goldman may well have been an empty creditor. That is, Goldman had bought credit default swaps on AIG from ``large financial institutions.'' As a result it did not care as much about what happened to AIG as it would have in the absence of such swaps. Indeed Goldman was vigorous in terms of calling for collateral from AIG. However, I am not saying Goldman did anything improper.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","No, but it did not work.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","What was interesting was the swaps did work for Goldman, but this situation helps suggest some of the social dimensions of credit default swaps. Do we really want----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, we are still--as you know, Professor, we are still wondering where the bottom is on AIG.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","I am only using this situation to illustrate matters related to the concerns you have; that is, you know, do we really--as a public policy matter----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is right.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","----shouldn't we be concerned about these creditors who used to really care about ensuring that their borrowers stay out of bankruptcy, that they can sometimes have much less of an incentive to do that, and that in today's world----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","We had better correct that.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","We might want to consider correcting that, yes, sir.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Senator Johanns.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","Actually, I would like to add to that answer, if that is OK, for a moment.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Go right ahead. I am over my time.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","It is important that we think about all the different reasons why a company might want to use credit default swaps--or a bank, for that matter. I, for example, could be in the supply chain of an industry and worried that the company to whom I have supplied goods or services may not actually perform. They may go into default. The ability to buy credit default swaps against that company makes it much more economically attractive for me, for example, to enter into a long-term sales agreement to provide goods and services to that company. I do not own the bonds, but I do have a position over time as being a creditor of that company as a supplier to them. Another example--and this one strikes home at Citadel because we lend money to a variety of companies around the world, in the United States from small companies up to the biggest, the Fortune 500. There is often no market for credit default swaps for mid-sized companies. If I want to be a significant lender to a portion of the economy where I absorb a substantial industry risk, for example, to the airlines, let us say I wanted to lend money to a regional carrier, I cannot buy a credit default swap on that regional carrier, but I can buy a credit default swap on the majors--American Airlines, Delta, and others. It will help me to manage the industry-specific risk that I have and that, most importantly, reduces the cost of capital for the mid-size company vis-a-vis the large company. So credit default swaps play a very important role in allowing banks, pension plans, and other lenders to mid-sized companies in America, to allow them to reduce their industry- specific risk and to reduce the cost of capital of the companies in America that have created the most jobs over the last 30 years.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Mr. Pickel, I think everyone wants to ask more questions, and Senator Bunning deserve a good answer from everyone. But as briefly as possible.",Speech,
"Mr. Pickel","All right. I would say that in the derivatives space--and this has been around for 25 years--a lot of the developments were on market risk--interest rates, currencies, equities, commodities, where you are managing a market risk. Credit risk is a new, a relatively new derivative, and I would say that we are still understanding some of the implications of that. And I think that Professor Hu's work has been very interesting in that regard. I would say that, regarding that empty creditor issue, the fact is that every time somebody is going to into the market and buying protection, which is he suggested somebody is doing, they are sending signals to that company: Your business plan is not working; your business plan is not working. The yellow light is getting brighter and brighter and brighter. And so when it comes to the end and somebody says, ``Time is up; I am not going to continue to lend to you,'' I think that is a natural evolution of this market, but let us certainly understand that. I would also just mention that credit default swap spreads are becoming embedded in various ways. They are being used for pricing loans. It was done with the rollback of Scotland extension of credit by the U.K. Government, and just today in the Wall Street Journal, it was mentioned that S&P has developed an additional means of providing information on credit exposure to the marketplace that incorporates a credit default swap spread. So we see continuing evolution here, and I think it ought to be encouraged, but, understood, certainly.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","I am going to recognize Mr. Whalen very quickly. Senator Johanns deserves his round. And then at the end if we have time, we will----",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","I am not ever worried about two people on one side or another of a market. So if somebody wants to buy and sell, you know, you have heard some very good examples of the utility of credit default swaps. The concern I have is that, again, the small airline, the small company, does not have a traded market and its debt that we can use the price these contracts. So we have, again, the Liar's Poker scenario, which is you have got a trader in one firm and a trader in another, and they have decided that the implied spread on the debt of this company is a good way to price a default contract. OK? The trouble is most people on Wall Street trade these instruments like bond options. They use them for delta hedging various exposures in debt or even equity markets, and, again, these are wonderful examples. They have great utility. But the problem is I suspect the pricing is wrong. In other words, CDS is not priced like default insurance. So when that contract goes into default and the provider of protection has to come up with the money, you have got to ask yourself, going back to the question about the supervision of dealers, is that person doing the work so that they are actually cognizant of what the cost of default is versus the spread on a bond? Lehman Brothers--you could have bought protection on Lehman Brothers a week before it failed at 7 percent. The next week you had to come up with 97 percent worth of cash per dollar of exposure to Lehman. So, you know, it is the pricing issue that I think is at the core here. It is not whether there is utility in CDS. There is obvious utility in all of these strategies.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","I am hoping somebody can answer this question. Of this whole bank of business, kind of an inartful term, but of this entire business arena, what percentage would be of that classification that is not easily valued?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","Oh, I think most over-the-counter contracts do not have a problem in that regard. If you are talking about energy, currency, whatever it is, if there is a rigorous traded cash market, it is easy to come up with a derivative, even if it is a very complex derivative. But when you are talking about illiquid corporate bonds or even loans to corporations, if you are talking about a complex structured asset that is, let us say, two or three levels of packaging away from the reference asset that it is supposed to be ``derived'' from, that creates complexity in terms of pricing that I think is rather daunting. And I will tell you now, there are very few firms on the street that have the people, the resources, and the money to do that work. Let me give you an example----",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Mr. Whalen, doesn't that get us to the point that I was raising in previous questioning? You know, you have now got a whole regulatory scheme. You have got somebody that is going to regulate it. They are hired and paid----",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","That is right, and----",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","----probably not very much money. And they are probably going to take the safe route here and say, ``Boy, I am not sure I understand this. I am not sure it can be valued. It is a $100 million contract. We want capital.''",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","And that is appropriate.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Yes. OK, so isn't that just another way just another way of getting to the--I mean, how will capital be posted in a circumstance like this?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","Indeed.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","If you had the capital, you would probably either loan it or not loan it. If it is a bad deal, you would not loan it. But, anyway, what I am getting to is this: Doesn't that basically put that segment of this arena out of business?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","It may, and I am not sure that would not be inappropriate, and I am sure my colleagues will disagree with me. But let me just put it to you this way: I do not think at the end of the day that most people on Wall Street are competent to be a rating agency. And if you are talking about calculating the probability of default of a company or a security, that is not a trivial exercise. It takes a lot of work. And I do not think most people on Wall Street do it. They look at the Bloomberg terminal and by consensus they have all agreed that the spread on the Bloomberg terminal, when you put it in this model, is the price you are going to deal on, whether it is right or not.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","You know, and I would say to you, Mr. Whalen, listening to your testimony just from a sterile standpoint and saying, ``Well, you know, if it is that kind of risk maybe it should be out of business,'' that is probably OK unless that is the only regional airline in town. And when that one goes away, guess what? Air transportation for half of western Nebraska goes away.",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","Well, I do not know any airlines that cannot hedge their fuel costs in the standard forward market.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Well, I am not talking about fuel costs. But you know what I am getting at here. There are always unintended consequences, and I just want to understand them. If we are going to put a lot of little guys out of business, tell me that, somebody.",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","Well, here is the thing. I want your little guy to have the same facility of pricing a contract as the dealer.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","How do we do that?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","Ahh, that goes to transparency, but you know what? If I have transparency of an instrument that is still opaque, even after I have legislated transparency, then I have a problem.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","And the tool we have been given, I think in the end is going to be the capital requirement. That is the ultimate protection. And boy, when you talk about what we require, you are talking about cash, Treasuries. It sounds to me like you are really talking about cash. You are probably not going to take something very risky here, right?",Speech,
"Mr. Whalen","I think the standardized market could bring those costs down, though, over time. I really do.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Yes, Mr. Pickel?",Speech,
"Mr. Pickel","Senator, yes. In the credit default swap area, we have introduced a very high degree of standardization, to I think your first point about which of these contracts would be most standardized. And I think that in the credit default swaps base, we do have contracts that will be very easy to move into a cleared environment, perhaps more so into an electronically traded or even exchange-traded environment. So those things are in place. And yes, I mean, people look to the Bloomberg screens, but it is the collective view of the marketplace, I mean, that arrives on Wall Street. We have got very active dealers around the world who are expressing views on these contracts and it is that collective reflection of the market judgment that indicates the spread at any particular point in time.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","I think the question that you were posing about capital and will the regulation of this market increase the amount of capital required in the marketplace, the answer to that question is not as clear-cut as one might imagine. The reason for it is because of today's silly market structure. If I buy credit protection from Goldman Sachs, I am likely to eliminate my economic risk but not my counterparty risk by closing that contract out with Morgan Stanley. I will still be posting margin as a customer to both of those firms. It is incredibly inefficient. If I had a central clearinghouse, I would open the contract with Goldman, clear it through a clearinghouse, close it with Morgan Stanley, clear it through a clearinghouse, and I would have no capital as a customer out the door any longer. I would actually have capital that comes back to me net-net. I think it is a very important concept to understand when we think of clearinghouses, this will not in any way necessarily increase the amount of capital demanded of the system as a whole because of the tremendous efficiency inherent in netting. The other key concept that we should keep in mind is that price transparency will most favor the smaller, less frequent users of derivatives. Citadel, is one of the world's largest alternative asset managers. We can price all of the derivatives that we commonly trade with a great degree of precision, but we have a tremendous investment in infrastructure to do so. For smaller companies, that is outside their range of capability. But on an exchange, a visible exchange traded price gives the CFO of a small company confidence that he is getting a fair deal, and part of what we want our capital markets to do is to create confidence in all Americans that our markets are fair, they are transparent, and they are just, because that reduces the cost of capital for every company in America.",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","You know, Mr. Griffin--and I will wrap up with this, Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your patience--nobody is going to disagree with your last speech. Boy, that is about as motherhood and apple pie as we can possibly get. Nobody disagrees with that. It is like I said. I just want to know if this is where we are headed, what impact is it going to have on the marketplace from the very small to the very large? My experience is the very large survive and they get bigger.",Speech,
"Mr. Griffin","Actually, you would be surprised where our analysis on this ends up. Today, the largest dealers have a de facto monopoly in the business. It is because of their credit rating and privileged position as credit intermediaries to almost every contract, they earn extraordinary economic profits. Where there is a clearinghouse, for example in the options market, the U.S. options market, the OCC acts as a clearinghouse for all listed transactions, you find that there is a vibrant, an incredibly vibrant market of smaller trading firms that add a tremendous amount of liquidity to the marketplace. Citadel, for example, is the single largest options market maker in the United States. We started out from scratch 7 years ago with zero market presence. Our ability to get to number one was because of a lack of barriers to entry. We were allowed to compete on a level playing field with other incumbents. In the credit default swap or interest rate markets, the barriers to entry are enormous. Who would want to take as a counterparty anyone but, quote-unquote, the firms viewed today as systemically important or too big to fail?",Speech,
"Senator Johanns","Here is--again, to wrap up the second time--here is what I would ask. If there are that many small firms out there that are going to benefit from this, my address is online. My phone number is online. Mr. Pickel, you probably represent some big and small people. Boy, I hope they overwhelm me with letters over the next 72 hours or e-mails saying, Mike, this is great, we want this to happen, because I am worried and concerned and I don't want this in the end to create a situation where literally by our regulatory effort we have damaged and created the very phenomena that this hearing is for, and that is the big just got bigger, to the point where literally we are all scratching our head about too big to fail. I think if we look back in 20 years and found out that is where we ended up here, that would be a tragedy. Thanks for your patience. I really appreciate it.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you all, gentlemen. If there are additional questions by our colleagues--I think also that Dr. Hu has been trying to get recognized. Can I give you a minute?",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","I will go under a minute.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","All right. Put on your microphone and go ahead.",Speech,
"Mr. Hu","I think that these clearinghouse arrangements that we are moving to will reduce systemic risk. They will also reduce the profits now available to derivatives dealers. It will be cheaper for everybody in terms of standardized products. I think that one of the very interesting issues to think about in connection with these clearinghouse arrangements relates to the data that we are now going to be requiring of all derivatives. In terms of customized derivatives, for instance, one of the real questions is how this requirement might be used to help to reduce this informational asymmetry between the regulators and the regulated. So, for instance, in terms of this general movement to more information being provided to regulators, to what extent should regulators actually ask for model information? Regulators can't understand how to value some of these products, unlike Citadel. To what extent should they actually require this kind of proprietary information? And if we require this kind of proprietary information, how do we maintain safeguards in terms of respecting its proprietary nature? So I think that this is the start of a very long process.",Speech,
"Chairman Reed","Well, thank you. Have the last word this evening, but not the last word because it is a long process. But this testimony has been excellent. Some of my colleagues might have written questions which they will forward to you. We would ask you within 2 weeks to please respond. All of your written testimony is part of the record and I thank you all for excellent testimony and for your presence this afternoon and I will adjourn the hearing.",Speech,
