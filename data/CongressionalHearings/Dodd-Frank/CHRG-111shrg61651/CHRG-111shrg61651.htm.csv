"Chairman Dodd","So we are going to make sure it is included in the record, along with any other supporting documents and evidence that all of you would like to offer this morning, and then I will turn to my colleagues for some questions here. We have some votes around 12:30, so we are going to try and move along if we can this morning, rather than bring you back again in the afternoon. I again thank all of you for being here. As I said a moment ago, this is our second hearing this week on the Obama administration's proposal to crack down on excessive consolidation and risk taking within our financial system. I would like to start by clarifying something that I said on Tuesday. Folks may have noticed I sounded a little frustrated, and they were correct in that observation. The fact is, I think all of us are to one degree or another frustrated with the present situation in our country and all anxious to see us get back on our feet and back on track again. The issues that Senator Shelby and I and the Members of the Committee are grappling with are difficult, they are complicated, and they are terribly important. But as we have been debating them for months--in fact, some of these issues we have been debating for years in this institution as well as elsewhere. But nearly 2 years after the collapse of Bear Stearns, we still have not updated the laws governing our financial sector, leaving our fragile economy with the same vulnerabilities that led to the economic crisis in the first place. I think we are at a critical point and juncture at this particular hour. Now, as my colleagues know, I laid out a discussion draft in November and Members of this Committee have been working together across the aisle to come up with a compromise, if we can, ever since, and I thank all of them. This has been a very difficult job, but they have spent countless hours on working on proposals here that we could present to our colleagues, and more importantly, to the country as to how we think we ought to fill in these gaps and move forward. We are now getting to the point where we need to sort of pull the trigger, in a sense, because hard-working American families can't wait much longer for a return to economic security and certainty. If I have heard one word over and over and over again, it is the lack of certainty that is out there, and part of our job is to help clarify and provide some certainty as to where we are headed, and our hope is with our legislation to do that. It is tough to take on another issue at this point. I made that point. There are wonderful ideas out there. There are a lot of things that we need to be talking about in the area of financial services. It was never my intention or, I believe, the intention of this Committee to solve every issue surrounding the financial services sector. We tried to focus on some critical ones that we think would make a fundamental difference, but never the assumption we could take on all the issues that people would like to raise in a moment like this. And we need to not only talk about filling in the gaps of the problems that existed, but looking ahead, which is our responsibility. What can we do to set up an architecture that would minimize the kind of problems we saw occurring again. If not in this particular environment or sector, where else could they emerge? And are we building the structural institutions that will minimize that from happening again beyond what we can imagine today, something 10 years, 20 years from now? And that is also part of our function and obligation, in my view, on this Committee. But while the specific proposals announced by the Administration have come late in the game, they deserve our serious consideration, as well, and I believe the Administration is on the right track, but finding a way to implement these proposals is no easy feat, as well. These are complicated issues meant to address complicated problems that leave our Nation's economy at risk and we need to find a balance between giving them their due consideration and appreciating the urgency with which we need to act given what is at stake. On Tuesday, we heard from Chairman Volcker and Treasury Secretary Wolin, and I appreciate the strong cases that they made for the Administration's proposals, as well as their thoughts on how we ought to move forward. Today, we have before us a very impressive panel of experts from the industry and academia to discuss the possible consequences of these proposals. I look forward to hearing from each and every one of you. What is more, I understand that for our industry friends, this might be a little like walking into the lion's den. But our intention here is to probe these ideas and solicit your thoughts and background and experience as to how to move forward. Let me just say, we did not embark on financial reform because we wanted to punish the industry. I certainly didn't, at all. We all want to create a system where business, large and small, can thrive, and that the users, the customers, the people who come through your doors, can have that confidence restored that our system is sound, it is safe, and they can rely on it, whether depositing their paycheck, buying a stock, an insurance policy, taking out a mortgage. It is the people not in this room today that want to know whether or not we get it and you get it, and we are going to create that structure that allows them then to have that sense of confidence and optimism that is the critical element for our economy recovery, in my view. So I have heard the arguments again and the industry's refusal, and I am not going to single out our witnesses, but the refusal of large firms to work constructively with Congress on this effort. It borders on insulting to the American people who have lost so much in this crisis. And from where I am sitting, it looks like instead of investing in improvements that would secure their financial strength, too many people in the industry have decided to invest in an army of lobbyists whose only mission is to kill the common sense financial reforms that we are working so hard up here to try to achieve, and we have been working on for a number of months. I have heard all the arguments for business as usual, but the American people have been through too much. Unemployment is still too high. The economy remains too vulnerable to support the status quo. That is unacceptable and we need to move forward. So I am determined as ever to get this strong bill to the floor of the Senate in an appropriate amount of time to allow full consideration of us here on this Committee and then by our colleagues, and then to work out our differences with the House and put a bill on the desk for his signature. So with that, let me turn to Senator Shelby for any opening comments, and then we will turn to our witnesses.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, I would just like to ask you to put my statement in the record so we can go on with the panel.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Done. Consider it done. Does anyone feel obligated to speak? Otherwise, the Corker Rule prevails. Our first witness is Gerald Corrigan, Managing Director with Goldman Sachs. He has been there for a long time. Prior to that, he was the Vice Chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee. Mr. Corrigan is also a native of the town of Waterbury, Connecticut. We don't often get to say that about witnesses here, that they come from Connecticut. We are proud of Gerry. He earned his Bachelor's degree from Fairfield University in Connecticut, as well. Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at MIG Sloan School of Management. He also serves as a Senior Fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Previously, Professor Johnson was the IMF's Chief Economist, from 2007 to 2008. John Reed, I have already mentioned here, is the former Chairman of Citigroup. He was also Chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 2003 to 2005. He currently serves on the MIT Leadership Center Advisory Council, and John, we welcome you back to the Committee. Hal Scott is the Nomura Professor and Director of the Program of International Financial Systems at the Harvard Law School. Again, he has been before this Committee on numerous occasions in the past. He has taught there since 1975. Much of his work focuses on international financial issues. He is also the Director of the Nonprofit Committee on Capital Markets Regulation. And Barry Zubrow, again, who we know well, is the Chief Risk Officer and Executive Vice President for JPMorgan Chase, and again, someone we are very familiar with on this Committee. Prior to that, he was the Chief Operating Officer of Goldman Sachs, where he has worked since 1979. We thank all of you for being here this morning on relatively short notice, as well, to share your thoughts on this issue and related matters, and Gerry, we will begin with you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I have again provided the Committee with a rather long statement which seeks to provide for you and your staffs some meaningful perspective on this financial reform process as a whole. And trust me, I am not going to go into the details of that, except to say that one key fact that we have to keep in mind throughout these deliberations is that the single most important proximate cause of the financial crisis was lending in all of its forms. I might just remind the Committee, probably not necessary, that based on my association with crises back in the 1980s and early 1990s, that was also true in those episodes, as well. My starting point for all of this, Mr. Chairman, is that I fully and enthusiastically agree that we have to put ``too big to fail'' behind us. My statement includes a summary of what I consider to be the financial reform agenda, the architecture, to use the word that you used, Mr. Chairman, and all I would say about that is that it is urgent that we move ahead with this. The execution will be very challenging. It is a package deal. If you fail on part of it, it will compromise other parts of it. And again, it is just a very, very difficult task. I think as a matter of perspective, it is important to keep in mind that there are a rich framework for existing rules and regulations out there already that are being enhanced by the legislative process that I think deal quite effectively with some of the issues that were raised by Chairman Volcker. I certainly do think that well managed and well supervised large institutions play a necessary and constructive role. Now, with regard to the Volcker plan itself, I would just make a couple of quick introductory remarks. First of all, there are many important definitional and details that yet need to be clarified, and in those circumstances, I have to say that it is not at all clear to me, at least at this stage, that the focus is on the issues that really were at the heart of the crisis itself. Certainly, we need greater clarification on that. Much of the focus is on so-called ``proprietary trading,'' and that, too, is a very difficult subject to define. But what I can say, based on my own kind of common sense effort to define proprietary trading at Goldman Sachs, is that over the cycle, the net revenues associated with so-called ``proprietary trading'' are 10 percent or less of firmwide revenues at Goldman Sachs. I also think that client-driven market making and hedging and risk management activities are, in my judgment, natural activities for well managed and well supervised banking groups. I think the outliers can be dealt with on a case-by-case basis, either with existing rules, much less with the enhanced rules that I am sure will flow out of the reform process. I also included in my statement, Mr. Chairman, a discussion of the issues associated with resolution authority, and resolution authority is critical to dealing with the ``too big to fail'' problem. And I have spelled out certain principles and prerequisites that I think are absolutely essential if we are to make resolution authority work, and ultimately, that, together with the other parts of the agenda I have specified, is how we will find success in the future and a safer, sounder, and more efficient financial system, while at the same time putting ``too big to fail'' behind us. I should also in closing, Mr. Chairman, say that, as I think you and others know, my respect and admiration for Chairman Volcker is unlimited. He is, in my judgment, one of the great, great figures of the past half-century or more. So it is not altogether the easiest thing in the world for me to take exception at least with some of the details that the Chairman has suggested. But I want to assure you and everyone else that I have more respect and more admiration for Paul Volcker than I do for any man or woman alive. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF E. GERALD CORRIGAN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, GOLDMAN, SACHS AND CO."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Gerry. I appreciate it very much.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Thank you, Senator. I strongly support the Volcker Rules, as everybody is starting to call them, in terms of the principles they put forward. I think there are two main principles. The first is that we should redesign the size cap that does already exist for U.S. banks, the size cap from the 1994 Riegle-Neal Act. We should redesign it to reflect current realities. And second, we should address the issue that has arisen, in particular over the past few years, of U.S. Government backing for very large financial enterprises that have basically an unlimited ability to take risk around the world. I do not, however, think that the exact formulation of the Volcker Rules as put forward is the right way to go. I think, actually, you should consider tightening the restrictions on the largest banks and reducing the size cap, and I would emphasize that our banks are now already much larger as a percent of the--our largest banks as a percent of the economy, a percent of total financial assets, than we have ever seen before in the United States. Our largest six banks have assets worth over 60 percent of GDP. This reflects, in addition to what has happened in the financial crisis and the bailout and the rescue, it reflects the underlying concentration of these financial markets. So the big four banks now have more than half of the mortgage market in this country and two-thirds of the market for credit cards. This is unfair competition. Because these banks are too big to fail, they have lower funding costs, they are able to attract more capital, they make more money over the cycle, and they continue to get larger. And I do not think that we have seen the end of this. If you look at the European situation today, for example, it is much worse than what we have in this country with regard to the size of the largest banks. Just as one example, the Royal Bank of Scotland peaked with total assets at 125 percent of U.K. GDP. That is a seriously troubled bank that is now the responsibility of the U.K. taxpayer. If we allow our biggest banks to continue to build on these unfair market advantages and the lower funding costs, we will head in the same direction. I think I would suggest to you that you consider imposing a size cap on banks relative not to total normal assets or liabilities, which is the Volcker proposal, because that is not bubble-proof. If you have a massive increase in house prices, real estate prices, such as happened in Japan in the 1980s, you will have a big increase in the normal size of bank balance sheets. And when the bubble bursts, you are going to have a big problem. I think the size cap should be redefined as a percent of GDP. And I think that while the science on bank size is, to be sure, incomplete and inexact, there is no evidence that I can find of any kind, and I have spent a lot of time talking to technical people from they financial sector and people at central banks, people in the banking system themselves have impressed various points on me. I cannot find anything--I put this in the written testimony--that supports the idea that societies such as ours should have banks with total assets larger than around $100 billion in today's money. Now, if you were to impose a size cap of, say, 3 or 5 percent of GDP, no bank can be larger than that size, that would return our biggest banks roughly to the position that they had in the early 1990s. Now, our financial system worked very well in the early 1990s. Goldman Sachs, as one example, was one of the world's top investment banks. I don't think anyone questioned the competitive sector. But since the early 1990s, we have developed a lot more system risk focused on the existence of these very big banks. So, as Mr. Corrigan said, the essence of this crisis was lending, but it was lending that at the heart of it was based on the idea you could make nonrecourse loans to people who can walk away from their homes when the house value falls, leaving the bank with huge losses. How do people think this was a good idea? Why did they think that this would survive as a business model? Well, I think it was very much about the size of these banks and very much about the support they expected to receive when they are under duress. So in conclusion, I think the Volcker principles are exactly right. I think they are long overdue. I think you should--I hope that you will take them up and develop them further. I think the degree of unfair market competition, the degree to which the community banks are disadvantaged by the current situation, because they have to pay a lot more money-- they pay higher interest for funds, their cost of capital is higher--this is unfair. This dynamic will continue unless you put an effective cap on it. The biggest banks will become even larger and even more dangerous. Thank you very much.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SIMON JOHNSON, RONALD A. KURTZ PROFESSOR OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SLOAN SCHOOL OF MANAGEMENT, MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. John, welcome again.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for your kind welcome. Senator Shelby and everybody, I appreciate the opportunity to be with you. I had never anticipated as a retired citizen that I would find myself here, but I really am here to voice support for Mr. Volcker's suggestion, the Volcker Rule. I do think that while details have to be worked out and so forth, I think that it is a good suggestion and one that is worthy of consideration by this Committee and the Congress in general. I don't say this because I think the absence of that rule was central to the difficulties that we have just come through. I don't think that is the case. But I do say it from the point of view that if we were take a blank piece of paper and we were to say to ourselves, how can we design a financial system that would both serve the public and also be relatively safe and relatively unlikely to have a repeat of what we had, you would start out certainly with capital, which needs to be augmented. You would certainly look at the structure of the regulatory framework, which I believe this Committee is doing. But I would argue that you would also look to maybe compartmentalize the industry, not deny any function to the industry in general, but compartmentalize it so as to limit economic spillover. But as somebody who has run a large company in this industry for a long time, because of the impact that it has on the culture and the makeup of the various firms, dealing with the capital markets, proprietary trading, proprietary investing, hedge fund market, so forth and so on, each of these bring with them their own culture. These are cultures that have to exist for the particular purpose, but they have their own particular characteristics and there is no question in my mind but these cultures have an impact on the institution within which they are embedded. And if I were asked to design a system, I would not allow these kind of cultures and activities to be a part of large depository and traditional lending institutions. It is not that I feel these functions shouldn't exist. I would simply separate them from institutions that are the deposit takers and basically the traditional lenders for much of the economy. And I do this because I think the culture from the capital markets that rubs off has to do with risk taking. It certainly has to do with compensation, and it has to do with the nature of the human fabric of the various entities that we are talking about. So I believe as a part of a comprehensive reform that Mr. Volcker's idea with regard to separation of some of these functions makes a lot of sense, not because I am concerned about the economics, but because I am concerned of the nature of the impact that these various activities have on the players and the financial markets. With regard to size, I would differ a little bit with Professor Johnson. I think the antitrust laws are quite capable of dealing with size in the marketplace. The place where size is the problem has to do with the intra-industry transactions, the so-called ``counterparty risk.'' This is where the ``too big to fail'' comes into play. It isn't the balance sheet of the bank that is the problem on ``too big to fail.'' It is the interconnectedness of one financial institution with virtually all other financial institutions. And so this is where I believe we must be concerned about size. You could deal with size by having capital requirements that relate to the size of intra-industry activity, and obviously increasing capital as intra-industry activity goes up. You also, and this has been proposed and I think it is a good idea, can ask that certain instruments be traded through exchanges. This acts as a circuit breaker, the exchanges. It acts as a circuit breaker in the transmission of difficulties. And you could deal with size by simply putting limitations on counterparty risk, on the degree of leverage that can exist with regard to intra-industry trading. So the issue of size, I think, is also relevant, and so I think the two keys to Mr. Volcker's suggestion, that of segregation of function within the industry and particularly the protection of the large deposit-taking institutions and the idea of being concerned about size, have merit and deserve the consideration of this Committee. A final comment, if I could. I believe that one of the reasons that JPMorgan Chase did better than many others during this recent crisis is they did not have embedded in that institution a real money market activity, a trading house. JPMorgan Chase was the amalgam of about five commercial banks, but none of them had a big investment banking trading activity in it, and the absence of that kind of function turned out in the crisis to give them a relative strengthened position.

"Mr. Scott","This Committee has been hard at work for several months on a broad range of issues of financial reform that are crucial to our Nation's future, including new resolution procedures to protect the taxpayers from loss, reduction of systemic risk through better capital requirements and central clearing for over-the-counter derivatives, and enhanced measures of consumer protection. Less than 2 weeks ago, the Administration announced the so- called ``Volcker rules.'' Whatever one thinks of the merits of these new proposals, it is undeniable that they will take considerable time to develop and debate. Tuesday's hearing certainly underscored this point. These new proposals should not hold up action on the pressing fundamental issues much further down the track, and I encourage this Committee's continuing efforts to reach a bipartisan consensus on these issues. The asserted objective of the new proposed rules is to limit systemic risk. In my judgment, they fail to do so. If the limits on proprietary trading only apply where banking organizations take positions ``unrelated to serving customers,'' they will have little impact. For example, with respect to Wells Fargo and Bank of America, such activity represents around 1 percent of revenues. While this has been estimated to be 10 percent of the revenues of Goldman Sachs, Goldman could easily avoid the requirements by divesting itself of its banking operations since deposit-taking constitutes only 5.19 percent of its liabilities. The real source of systemic risk in the banking system, as demonstrated by this crisis, is old-fashioned lending. It was mortgage lending that was at the heart of the financial crisis. I do not agree with Mr. Volcker that these traditional activities, by the way, are entitled to a safety net. Banks should not be bailed out, whatever the reason for their losses. Indeed, the focus should be, as it is in the pending legislation, to control risky activities of whatever kind. The Volcker rules would also prohibit banks from investing in, or sponsoring, private equity including venture capital funds. This would have little impact on the large banks whose investment in private equity accounted for less than 2 percent of their balance sheets. On the other hand, bank private equity investments are important to the private equity industry as a whole, accounting for $115 billion or 12 percent of private equity investment. Depriving the industry of this important source of funds could impede our economic recovery. Turning to the size limitation proposal, let me stress that this proposal does not purport to decrease the present size of any U.S. financial institution nor would it prevent any financial institution from increasing its size through internal growth. The proposal, as I understand it, would only limit the growth of nondeposit liabilities achieved through acquisition. Accordingly, if banks or other financial institutions are too big to fail, this proposal will have no impact on them. Indeed, it even permits them to get bigger. In thinking about size, our concern should be with the size of a bank or other financial institution's interconnected positions, not its total size, because it is the degree of interconnectedness that drives bailouts, and here I fully agree with what Mr. Reed said on this. I fail to see how market share of nondeposit liabilities could be a proxy for position size. Let me briefly turn to the international context. Without international consensus, adopting these proposals will only harm the competitive position of U.S. financial institutions. These proposals have not been agreed to, even in principle, by the G-20 or major market competitors, unlike most of the other proposals that the House has considered and that are presently before your Committee. While major market leaders and international organizations have been polite in welcoming these proposals, they have not endorsed them. In conclusion, do these proposals deserve further consideration and debate? Absolutely. But are they central to reform? In my view, they are not, and I would stress the fact that they should not in any event hold up action on the complex matters already before your Committee. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. Mr. Zubrow, welcome to the Committee again.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Thank you very much, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, Members of the Committee. Thank you for giving us the opportunity to appear this morning. While the history of the financial crisis has yet to be written conclusively, we know enough about the causes to recognize that we need substantial regulatory reform. Our current framework was patched together over many decades. When it was tested, we saw its flaws all too clearly. Mr. Chairman, I want to assure you and the other Members of the Committee that we strongly support your efforts to craft and pass meaningful regulatory legislation. In our view, the markets and the economy reflect continued uncertainty about the regulatory environment. However, the details matter a great deal, and a bill that creates further uncertainty or undermines the competitiveness of the U.S. financial sector will not serve our goal of a strong, stable economy. At a minimum, we need a systemic regulator to monitor risk across our financial system. In addition, as we at JPMorgan Chase have stated repeatedly, no firm, including our own, should be too big to fail. Regulators need enhanced resolution authority to wind down failing firms, in a controlled way that does not put taxpayers' dollars at risk or the broader economy at risk. Other aspects of the regulatory system also need to be strengthened, including consumer protection, capital standards and the oversight of OTC derivatives. But I emphasize systemic risk regulation and resolution authority because they provide a useful framework for consideration of the most recent proposals from the Administration. Two weeks ago, the Administration proposed new restrictions on certain activities related to proprietary trading, hedge funds and private equity. The new proposals are a divergence from the hard work being done by legislators, central banks and regulators around the world to address the root causes of the financial crisis and to establish robust mechanisms to properly regulate systemically important financial institutions. While there may be valid reasons to examine these activities, there should be no misunderstanding. The activities the Administration proposes to restrict did not cause the financial crisis. Further, regulators currently have the authority to ensure that these risks are adequately managed in the areas that the Administration proposes to restrict. We need to take the next logical step of extending these authorities to all systemically important firms regardless of their legal structure. If the last 2 years have taught us anything, it is that threats to our financial system can and do originate in nondepository institutions. Thus, any new regulatory framework should reach all systemically important entities, including investment banks whether or not they have insured deposits. All systemically important institutions should be regulated to the same rigorous standards. If we leave some firms outside the scope of this regulation framework, we will be right back where we were before the crisis started. We cannot have two tiers of regulation for these systemically important, interconnected firms. As I noted at the outset, it is also very important that we get the details right. Thus far, the Administration has offered few details on what is meant about proprietary trading. Any individual trade taken in isolation might appear to be proprietary trading, but in fact is part of a mosaic of serving clients and properly managing the firm's risks. If defined improperly, this proposal could reduce the safety and soundness of our banking institutions, raise the cost of capital formation and restrict the availability of credit for businesses, large and small, all with no commensurate benefit to reducing systemic risk. Similarly, the Administration has yet to define what ownership or sponsorship of hedge funds and private equity activities means. Asset managers, including JPMorgan, serve a broad range of clients including individuals, universities and pensions, and need to offer these investors a broad range of investment opportunities across all types of asset classes. In each case, investments are designed to meet the needs of our clients. While we agree that the United States must show leadership in regulating financial firms, if we take an approach that is out of sync with other major countries, without any demonstrable risk reduction benefit, we will dramatically weaken our firms' ability to serve our clients in this Country. The Administration also proposed certain limits on the size of financial firms. If you consider the institutions that failed during the crisis, some of the largest and most consequential failures were standalone investment banks, mortgage companies, thrifts and insurance companies, not the diversified financial firms that appear to be the target of the Administration's proposals. It is not AIG's or Bear Stearns's size that led to their problems, but rather the interconnection of those firms that required the Government to step in. In fact, our capabilities, size and diversity were essential to both withstanding the impacts of the crisis and emerging as a stronger firm, but equally importantly putting us in a position to acquire Bear Stearns and Washington Mutual when the Government asked us to help. An artificial cap on liabilities will likely have significant negative consequences. Banks' liabilities and capital support the asset growth of their lending activities. By artificially capping liabilities, banks may be incented to reduce the growth of assets or the size of their existing balance sheets, which in turn would restrict our ability to make loans to consumers, to businesses, as well as to invest in Government securities. While numerical limits and strict rules may sound simple. There is great potential that they would undermine the goals of economic stability, growth and job creation. The better solution is modernization of our financial regulatory regime that gives regulators the authority and the resources needed to do the rigorous oversight involved in examining firms' balance sheets and lending practices. Let me conclude by just noting that it is vital that you as policymakers and those like us, with a stake in our financial system, work together to overhaul regulation thoughtfully and well. While the specific changes may seem arcane and technical, they are critical to the future of our economy. We look forward to working with the Committee to enact reforms that will position our financial industry and economy for sustained growth for decades to come. Thank you and I look forward to your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF BARRY L. ZUBROW, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF RISK OFFICER, JPMORGAN CHASE AND COMPANY"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. I will ask the clerk to put on, let's say, 6 minutes. So we will try and get through. We have a lot of good participation here this morning. Let me begin on the issue and ask all of you briefly to comment on it. There are a lot of issues surrounding this proposal, and I am going to focus on the issue of the proprietary trading side. I think some of you made a pretty good case, and I find myself sympathetic to the notion of the size question, that this is very difficult. It is the interconnectedness that I think makes a lot of sense to me. So, in my time, I want to focus on the other matter where there seems to be a little bit more of diversity of opinion, and the issue is the effective ability, in my view, to effectively draw that bright line between proprietary trading and these other activities. I know there was some interest. Bob Diamond, who is the CEO of Barclays, reportedly made a speech in this recent matter at a gathering in Switzerland. Let me tell you the quote. He said, and I am quoting here. This is the report of the quote: ``It is very, very difficult to think that we can differentiate between the risk bank's stake and the normal course of business for their clients and customers and proprietary trading.'' Then another of his colleagues, apparently at the same setting, said the following: ``I can find a way to say that virtually any trade we make is somehow related to serving one of our clients. They can go ahead and impose the rule on Friday, and I can assure you that by Monday we will find a way around it. Nothing will change unless the definition is ironclad.'' Now I do not know who said that at that meeting, but that was the report of the meeting. And I have said that yesterday as well, that before even the ink dries on a proposal here, there will be very bright, young people who will sit and figure out some way to do a dodge. Is that your conclusion? Putting aside whether or not you agree whether we ought to do it or not, can we write such a thing here that would be ironclad, that would actually prohibit this kind of activities, and to such a degree? John, why do you not go ahead?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Mr. Chairman, I believe you can. If you run a bank, you know what you are doing. You have to have limits for the various activities in your trading floor. There is no question that people can cheat and break rules. It happens all the time. Regulators, on the other hand, can catch them. If you say to a financial institution that proprietary trading is not an accepted practice, any well-managed financial institution knows how to run its business in such a way as not to be engaged in proprietary trading. And people who argue that you cannot find this out have not in fact run these institutions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Johnson.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Senator, I tend to agree with you completely on this question. You can. Within the banks, if the executives decide to shut down proprietary trading, they can do it. Sandy Weil, if I am not mistaken, closed the proprietary desk of Solomon Smith Barney in 1998 because he did not like the positions and the losses that they had incurred. But to come in from the outside and to say to legislators, or have regulators say, no more proprietary trading would I think lead to exactly the kind of evasion, evasive tactics you are talking about because there are many other ways to construct the same sort of risk return profile, which is what really they are going for with proprietary trading. They will not call it proprietary trading. It can disbursed. It can be put in different ways. So I agree with John Reed, that if the management really wants to do this, they will do it. But to impose it from the outside I think would be illusory at best and could lead to all kinds of dangerous distortions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Gerry, in asking you to respond to the same question, tell us here what the impact would be on Goldman in terms of revenue and profits. Would it put a prohibition on hedge fund activity, private equity activity? As a practical matter, what happens at Goldman if we have an ironclad rule?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","The answer is not as much as some people tend to think. I think it is theoretically possible, Mr. Chairman, to construct a very tight regime for a very, very limited class of activities that you could call proprietary trading, where there is absolutely no interaction whatsoever between a group of proprietary traders and clients, and that activity is totally walled off within a given institution. But that would be a situation which I think would provide some liquidity to markets and price discovery, and that is fine. But to take the Goldman Sachs situation, if you took the net revenues associated with the best I can do to imagine a sensible definition, for example, of proprietary trading and hedge funds and private equity funds, we are, in net revenue terms, talking about something over the cycle in the broad order of magnitude of 10 percent of firmwide net revenues. Now I say over the cycle because in good years it could be a little higher, in bad years a little lower. But if you want a reference point, at least using Goldman Sachs as the example, that I think is as good as I can do right now since I do not know what the definitions that other people would have in mind when they talk about these alternative schemes.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me ask. Paul Volcker said he used, I believe it was Potter Stewart in his definition of pornography: You know it when you see it. I am hesitant to go down this road, but nonetheless since he used Paul Volcker talk, which gets to the point in a sense that Professor Johnson and John Reed were making, that if it is the bank institution looking at it, and they know it when they see it, that is one thing. When the regulator is looking at it, you could end up with two different people with a very different analysis of whether or not something is pornography. So the lack of clarity and the lack of certainty seem to be affected. So I have to look at this from the standpoint of not only the institution, what the effect is on the institution and the risk posed by it, but can you define it in a clear enough way so that a good regulator would be able to identify it and see it and respond do it. And that is really the prism I think through which we have to look at this--not to exclude how the institution looks at it, but more importantly I see it as how the regulator would look at it. Do you agree with that? And, if so, then I pose the question again. Can you do this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Mr. Chairman----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","And put it this way, I really do not like it. But could you do it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","I do think it is also important to remember that Justice Potter Stewart's remark also went on to say, with respect to pornography, that this is not it. And I think Mr. Volcker is also having the difficulty in saying that it is a very simple definition and it is very easy to see, but he seems to be having difficulty coming up with what that pure definition should be. I think that one of the significant issues that the Committee should is that proprietary trading not only means different things to different people, but in different contexts can mean different things. So, for instance, we obviously, in our regular market-making activities and client-facing activities, often take on positions from clients. We then need to hedge those risks. Now is that proprietary trading? Those risks have been given to us. They came out of client market-making activities, but now they are the bank's risks. So, if we want to go out and hedge those risks prior to being able to flatten those positions, that obviously could be interpreted by some as a form of proprietary trading. I would agree with Gerry's comment--if you take the extremely narrow definition and say that you put a group of traders in walled-off area, give them an amount of capital. That is not a business that we are in. That is not something that we find strategically attractive. Obviously, if we were to eliminate that type of activity, that would not have a particular impact on the firm.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. I have gone over my time, and I apologize to my colleagues.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Corrigan, under existing authorities today, regulators are able to ensure the safety and soundness of an institution. I think that underlies everything here. Do you believe that regulators presently have the ability to restrict a firm's activities, including their proprietary trading, if they deem this not to be a safe and sound practice?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","I do not think there is any question at all, Senator, that they have the authorities. That is a no-brainer. One of the principles----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","If they have the authority, then it is a question of do they have the will to use their authority. Is that right?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","That is precisely the point, Senator. One of the principles that I articulated in the statement that I gave you is that going forward the official community has to conduct its affairs in such a way that what we call prompt corrective action becomes a reality rather than a slogan, and that I think is one of the great challenges that we face in the context of this whole effort of regulatory reform. I do think there have been some cases in the past where this notion of prompt corrective action works, but I think in the future we need to make it work better. Two elements, Senator, that go into that are a much, much more aggressive framework of stress testing. One of my favorite inventions that Mr. Zubrow knows about, reverse stress tests and extreme contingency analysis have to play a much bigger role in the future than they have in the past. If we can do that appropriately, which I think we can, I think that that is one of the absolute prerequisites for making resolution authority work.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Speaking of that, Mr. Zubrow, Senator Corker and Senator Warner on this Committee have spent a lot of time on how do we find resolution authority here in our hopeful legislation, piece of legislation. If we basically all agree-- and I hope we do--that nothing is too big to fail, and if we have sound regulation, the power, that regulators have the tools to regulate and do their job, safety and soundness trumps. What are a couple of things that you would suggest, and they may have covered already, these two Senators, in any resolution authority that would be deemed so important?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Well, thank you very much, Senator for that question, and I agree with you. I think Senator Warner and Senator Corker are doing a terrific job leading the effort to really focus on what we mean by resolution authority.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","And I think that, first and foremost, it is very important that there be a clear regime in which firms can be allowed to fail. And part of that is obviously a recognition that when a firm gets into trouble, that they managements of those firms should be eliminated, the shareholders should be wiped out, and the creditors should be able to be dealt with through the existing regimes of the bankruptcy laws.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Hopefully, the taxpayer will not have to step up, right?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Absolutely. And if you eliminate the shareholders' equity, if you have the ability to eliminate unsecured debt to the extent that is needed, then obviously there should be more than enough resources in those circumstances, so that the taxpayers do not have to be involved in any way in a bailout of those firms. I think it is also very important that large, complex firms be prepared with their regulators for that potential eventuality. We have already begun discussions with our lead regulator, the Fed, about how would we think about how a regulator would step in, in a resolution regime, because I think it is very important that the regulator as well as the firms themselves think about the various steps that might happen under that situation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Is it in your mind very, very important that any legislation dealing with resolution authority be unambiguous that nothing is too big to fail, and if it bellies up we are going to close it down?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","I think that it is absolutely critical that that be clear in the legislation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Professor Johnson, you have a comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","If I may, Senator, in the whole discussion of resolution authority, if I could just speak from the perspective of my previous job at the International Monetary Fund, that the hottest issue is the cross-border resolution. I think all the firms that are represented here and most of them sitting behind me are cross-border firms with massive, complicated international pressures. One thing we learned from the failure of Lehman is that regulators have just different statutory frameworks. There is a massive conflict over that. And the only way around that, at least on an interim basis, is to have a conservatorship, which is not exactly failing. That is the Government putting in money into AIG type situation. Unless you have cross-border authority----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","That is what these two Senators I mentioned have in mind, but they can speak for themselves.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","My basic point from the perspective of the IMF, I would suggest, is that unless you have a cross-border resolution authority, which even the Europeans have struggled to establish within Europe, let alone U.S. to Europe, let alone U.S. to emerging markets, any resolution authority based just on the U.S. is not going to achieve the goals that you quite rightly are emphasizing.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Professor Scott.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","To come back to what the ``too big to fail'' problem is, I think it is the degree of interconnectedness. So what you have to ask yourself, in addressing your question, is: Will we have the insolvency of a large institution which we have to rescue because it is too interconnected to let it fail? That might not be affected by the size of the total institution. It is a function of its positions with other parties. So, in answering the question, should a resolution authority not be permitted to bail out an institution, I think it would have to have a very high degree of confidence that you would not have a situation in which an institution failed that was highly interconnected because if you did not bail it out, then you risk a chain reaction of failures. So I think it is really important to understand the degree of interconnectedness of our institutions, and I think we have done a woeful job at uncovering that and that a lot more attention needs to be focused on what these connections are. For instance, I think we thought when AIG was rescued that it had to do with their counterparty positions. But then we are told by some of their counterparties, one of whom is sitting at this table, that they were totally protected in the event of an AIG failure. And I am not questioning that, but what I am questioning or asking is if you are going to design a resolution authority that says we will never rescue an institution, you have to have a high degree of confidence that you will never be in a position where these large connected positions could create a chain reaction of failures if you did not rescue the institution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Reed, do you believe that regulators lacked necessary authority and power to rein in reckless activities or do you think that regulators simply failed to use their available tools? And do you believe that regulators have been held accountable for their failure?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Well, I agree with Gerry, the regulators clearly have the authority to rein in any practice. They have failed to do so for the human reason that they get captured and caught up with the current wisdom. It is very difficult to organize a structure that can systematically have a contrary view and divorce itself from current wisdom. The regulators have the authority. It is rare indeed that the regulators have anticipated and stopped problems. I do not think many people at all have been held accountable for what is going on. The regulators certainly have not been held accountable nor necessarily have the managements and boards of some of the financial institutions involved--so, in terms of who has been held accountable, not many. Can we rely solely on regulation, I do not believe so. You certainly need regulation. You need the right regulation. And you need a strong regulatory structure, but it is not in itself, I believe, sufficient.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","You got to have good management.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","And that is why I like this compartmentalization. Everybody is playing around with what is proprietary trading. That, with due respect, if you are running a company, you know if you are in the business or not. You do not hire the kind of people who want to be in that kind of business if you are not supposed to be in it. I believe that the nature, the human makeup of an institution is extremely important, and that is why I tend to favor Mr. Volcker's thought on regulating some of these types of activities that bring in a different kind of culture to big depository institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Reed, would the Volcker Rules be difficult to implement? What challenges would it pose to the regulators?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Senator, I don't think they would be difficult to implement and I don't think it would be a regulatory issue. I think it would be a management issue. In other words, if there were rules with regard to the nature of businesses that certain entities could be engaged in, you could count on most good management to try to follow those rules. Regulators might well debate with the management whether certain practices are, in fact, OK or not. But those kind of debates are quite healthy and the regulators, if they insist, have the authority to have their views hold. When I was in the banking business, there were any number of activities that were not permitted of the banks that I was responsible for running at the time. We never had any problem knowing where the rules were and we didn't specialize in trying to get around the rules. The regulators are quite able to spot when a management is behaving differently than the rules call for and they certainly have the capacity to stop it. So I don't believe this is a real issue.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Professor Scott, there are concerns that allowing commercial banks to engage in proprietary trading activities unrelated to serving customers creates unmanageable conflicts of interest. Can you provide some examples of these conflicts of interest in our marketplace?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","Not in the actual marketplace, Senator, but I think I could talk about the hypothetical marketplace.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","And I could see a situation in which a customer's interest was adverse to the interest of a proprietary trader. The customer would have a position that the trader was taking the opposite side of. It could hurt the customer's position. Now, my understanding is, of course, that these activities are walled off and that the proprietary trading desk is totally separate from the people who would be dealing with the customers and that that really handles the situation. I should say that commercial banking is full of potential conflicts. This is not the only conflict. And indeed, in the debate over Glass-Steagall, the emphasis was not on this. It was actually on underwriting, which nobody is attacking here, and the thought was that banks who took positions in underwriting, were potentially exposed to risk on underwriting, would not act in the interest of their customers and force them to buy something in order to protect the bank from risk. Again, we handled that situation by trying to isolate activities within the organization. So I don't think--if you are really worried about conflicts, this is a much bigger issue, and I wouldn't start with proprietary trading if I were worried about it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Zubrow, at Tuesday's hearing with Chairman Volcker and Secretary Wolin, there was much discussion about how to define proprietary trading. In your testimony, you echo those concerns. If you were trying to prevent or stop the riskiest types of proprietary trading activities at commercial banks, how would you define proprietary trading?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Thank you, Senator. As I said, I think that it is very important to make sure that banks are able to continue to trade in ways that will allow them to hedge exposures that they take on. And so if I were to come up with a definition that was trying to wall off something that was pure proprietary trading, it would be utilizing the definition of taking a group of traders, putting them into a separate area, having the firm invest capital in that, and have that group not be engaged at all in any client or market making or other activities other than just trading of that particular capital. I do think, as I said before, that it is very important that firms like ours have the ability to continue to manage the various risks that we take on in our client-facing businesses and to not allow some broad definition to be enacted that would limit our ability to properly manage those risks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","Professor Johnson, some preliminary analysis of the Volcker Rules contend that this proposal could have profound effects on the profits and business models of large U.S. financial firms, particularly those whose proprietary trading functions are fully integrated into the firm's global business. Do you agree with this statement?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Senator, the evidence that I have seen suggests it would have a relatively small impact on the profitability of these banks, with the possible exception of Goldman Sachs, as Mr. Corrigan emphasized. That 10 percent over the cycle of net revenues is probably an outlier for a bank holding company, and, of course, there is discussion about whether people who have bank licenses would be allowed to hand those licenses back and go off and become some independent structure not regulated by the Federal Reserve. If that were to be the outcome of the Volcker Rule, if that were permitted by the rules that you draw up and how they are implemented, that would be a complete disaster, because you can't have a situation where banks are very big doing banking activities not subject to comprehensive, tough regulation, which is, I hope, what we will get out of the regulatory structure that you create. You can't just go off and take those massive risks and then when you face a collapse say, oh, I would like my banking license back. And Goldman Sachs, I think, got a one-time-only pass--I hope--when they were allowed to go to bank holding company in September 2009--2008.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","My time has expired.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank all of you for your testimony. I think the Volcker Rule is--I think the goal of it is one that all of us would like to achieve, and that is figuring out a way that institutions are not too big to fail. I think the abstract nature of it made it difficult. I want to agree with our Ranking Member. I think there is a lot of regulation in place, if regulators will just do what they are supposed to do to keep much of what has happened from happening. And I do think there ends up being a capturing of those regulatory. They are embedded in your institutions. They get to know you. They are having coffee with you every day. They are going to lunch. And the next thing you know, things happen. So I hope we can figure out a way to keep that from happening in the future. But Mr. Corrigan, I understand that in many ways, if the Volcker-like Rule was put in place, Goldman would be the Br'er Rabbit of this whole deal, that you drop your holding company situation and have less competition. I wonder if you might respond to that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Well, first of all, it is not entirely clear to me that that would be the result, but let me come back to that in a minute. Under the House bill, and I hope that under the Senate bill and the ultimate legislation, we would have a regime in which any systemically important institution would still be subject to consolidated supervision, presumably by the Fed.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Now, you are answering a question I didn't ask, so since it is my time, I am going to--so you can either go right to that question----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","But that is the starting point for your question.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","So whether Goldman Sachs continued to be a bank holding company or not, it would still be subject to consolidated prudential supervision. I think that is the way it should be.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I was struck by your testimony regarding all institutions, that no institutions should be too big to fail, and then your solution was that if a company failed, they would go into temporary conservatorship. That is not much of a failure. So I am shocked by that and I wonder----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Well, let me----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","----I think what we have all been talking about is that if you fail, you don't exist anymore and a temporary conservatorship is much like what we have just gone through.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Well, let me define terms a little bit better here, if I may. First of all, when I talk about temporary conservatorship, I have in mind that this feature of the process would exist only for a very short period of time, a matter of days or weeks. And I am not sure that conservatorship technically is the right legal word. But what I feel very strongly about is that we need to have a limited period of time after the institution in question has been taken over by the authorities--the shareholders are out, the managers are out, the board is out--we need a limited period of time to be able to put ourselves in a position where we can, in fact, execute a prompt, timely, orderly wind-down of an institution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Or receivership.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","That is correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Let me move on. I appreciate very much your testimony. I would say that even under the Volcker Rule, if you had consolidated supervision but didn't have a bank holding company status, you would not be under the Volcker Rule. So consolidated supervision is not what is relevant. But let me move to Mr. Reed. I found your comments interesting, and certainly I respect each of you very, very much, as I do Mr. Volcker. But the comments about separating these, you were Chairman of Citigroup when all of this was put together. I think that is fascinating for all of us to know that you kind of put all this together and now are an advocate of separating, and I just wondered what you might share that you have learned since that time. And I would add another question, since I may run out of time. A lot of people think that Citigroup is one of those organizations--and I was watching the body language when we were talking about failure--that Citigroup is one of these companies, because of payment mechanisms that exist around the world with sovereign governments and others, that Citigroup cannot fail, OK, that they are so interconnected. And I think what all of us are seeking, even Chairman Volcker and others, is figuring out a way that regardless of the interconnectedness, there never will exist again in our country a financial institution that is too big to fail. We don't like that moral hazard. It goes against the American way. And yet there are people who come in, I think, and believe that a Citigroup, I am sorry, they are so interconnected, they have payment systems, and I wonder if guys like you and others laugh at us when we say that we want to create a regime that absolutely ends forever in the American vocabulary that any company is too big to fail. I think that is the goal of many people on this Committee, maybe not everybody, but I think many people. And I ask everything I have just asked with respect. I do find it fascinating, your position. And then, second, I wish you would respond to the issue of ``too big to fail.''","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Senator, I learned a lot. There is no question that when we put Travelers and Citi together, we created a monster, and most of the difficulties we have had have stemmed from the Salomon Brothers side. Salomon had just been recently acquired by Travelers, but this is why I am so sensitive to the cultural impact. I am suggesting that it would be healthier for the system-- it may not be healthier for Citi's stockholders, but I am retired. I am free to speak as an individual citizen----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","It is kind of like a Senator who is not running again.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","That is right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","So my honest belief, having experienced it and having lived with it for years, is that the system would be stronger if we could provide for some separation where major depositories are not major actors in the capital markets. And you will notice that as I made my comments about these cultures, I didn't talk only about proprietary trading and proprietary investing. I talk about this interface with the capital markets. I believe that it is very difficult to manage these cultures. It is not impossible, but it is very difficult. They are hard to contain. They have big impacts on the risk taking sort of attitudes at the top of the company and the nature of the people who are working in the company. I think the system would be sounder if we had a couple major institutions that were a little pedestrian and that weren't occupied by all my colleagues from MIT who are pretty good at math. So I have come to the conclusion, having lived it, that the system would be better if we allowed for some compartmentalization. And as I said in my testimony, as I said in my written remarks, I would look at compartmentalization of culture as much as of economic function because it is the people within the company. So I have learned from my experience, and I think probably there wasn't a much more relevant experience around, and my conclusion is the system would be better. I am not speaking for the stockholders. The system would be better if we allowed for the type of separation that Mr. Volcker is talking about, and I think he probably comes at it from the same point of view. I saw him recently and he said, ``John, it is the first time you and I have ever agreed, isn't it,'' because we have had a number of issues where we didn't. But I think he saw it from the same point of view. Too big to fail, Senator, I am totally on your side. We have to come up with a mechanism that, regardless of the particular interconnectedness--Gerry is correct, we may need time to get this organized, but you have to be able to let institutions fail and I think you have to wipe the stockholders out. I think you have to wipe the board and the management out. And we have to have that mechanism. And it is true that Citi, in its current structure, would be very difficult to unwind, and the global issue would come up right away. And this global issue is real. There is no question. I forget the name of the British institution that failed in Singapore--Barings failed in Singapore. The Bank of England could not control the unwinding of this because the Singaporian authorities got into the middle of it and you had this cross-legal jurisdiction problem. So I do think Professor Johnson is correct in that regard, but I am on your side totally that we must come up with an architecture that allows us to say any person that gets in big trouble must be permitted to fail, and the bias has to be in that direction. The question, Senator, why did we save Long-Term Capital? It was alone. It could have been allowed to fail. But the instinct of regulators is to organize a rescue mission. And so I think you need a structure that sort of dampens that instinct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I would love to hear from everybody, and I don't want to be rude to my colleagues by asking another question, but I do hope in another setting we can, on the phone or by e-mail, talk more about the interconnectedness Professor Scott and many of you have brought up. I thank each of you for your testimony and I do hope we figure out a way to deal with the interconnectedness in a way that, through legislation or some other mechanism, regulation, that allows big companies to fail. I just want to say, it seems like every crisis we have had since I have been alive, and I am 57, has centered on real estate--just about--and somehow or another we still don't talk about that and we talk about all these other things, but that is a subject for another day. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, and let me just say again, I said at the outset in my remarks, having now just chaired this Committee in my third year, since January of 2007, the tremendous talent on this Committee. This is a hard subject matter and all of you have spent your lives involved in this. None of us claim to have lifetime experiences in all of these matters, but we have had tremendous contributions from Bob Corker and Mark Warner, Jack Reed, so many people on this Committee, delving into the various aspects of this, and it is hard work. It is difficult work. It is arcane work, in many ways, and we are all very sensitive to the notion that every good idea has an unintended consequence and trying to think through all the ripple effects of what you are suggesting. At one level, it can seem like the best idea in the world. And as you delve into it--I said the other day on these matters, I kind of regret we are not back 5 or 6 years ago when we knew a lot less about all of this than we have learned. It was easier when you knew less in terms of the answers for things. So I thank the Senator from Tennessee. He has been tremendously valuable on this Committee, along with others.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Reed, I have been struck by what you have learned. I think we have learned something, too, and I think we have to carry it into the formulation of new regulations. First, we can't assume regulatory capacity adequate to the complexity of the financial markets. That is a function of funding and appropriations. It is a function of ideology. It is a function of personalities. But many of the discussions that we have heard, I think assume that, and I think that is an assumption that we have to question. The other aspect of this is managerial capacity, as you point out in your comments on culture. This would have been a different world if there had been different individuals at different institutions, but they were there. And I think also, too, in terms of who rises to the top of these complex institutions is a function not sometimes of who they are but what they do and how much money they make for the company. So I sense all of that. I think in that regard Chairman Volcker has raised the right sort of issue, but I think perhaps we have sort of taken the wrong path and we are now talking about proprietary trading and how to define it, et cetera. I think your approach is much more, I think, on target, which is what do we want? We want financial institutions, commercial banks, who focus on serving customers, who are businesses, consumers, basically, and we want them to be their core competency, et cetera. So one way to look at this is to say rather than you can't do proprietary trading, is that if your core business is just a fraction of what you do, then why should we allow you to get to the discount window? Why should we include you in Section 13(3)? That is not our policy. Our policy is to support a vigorous commercial banking system. What about that approach, Mr. Reed?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Senator, I agree with you. I think what we are striving is to have a healthy commercial banking sector. I think it is very important that there be a Goldman Sachs in the world and so forth and so on, and no one is suggesting that these activities be prohibited, simply that they not be in these big depository institutions. Commercial banks used to focus on customers and basically provide working capital finance. And if you needed to get into exotic instruments and so forth, the commercial banks didn't do that. I think the recent crisis through which we are stumbling would have been much different had there been three or four large depository institutions that weren't in the center of it. I think one reason why JPMorgan Chase was able to play a positive role is that they did not have in the core of their business these kind of activities. They had some problem activities in terms of sourcing mortgages from third parties and so forth, but they played a positive role. The Bank of America, which absorbed Merrill Lynch, had the capacity because they didn't have these kind of problems. I think it served the country well to have some of these institutions that were not tainted by these kind of activities. But I don't think the solution is to now say we will let everybody do everything. I think we want our big depository institutions to focus on serving their customers, providing working capital, finance, deposits, consumer, and so forth.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Mr. Johnson.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","If I could just add to that, Goldman Sachs in 1997 was about a $200 billion bank in terms of assets. It was about $270 billion in today's money. It peaked at about $1.1 trillion. Now, I completely agree with Mr. Reed that having risk takers and risk-taking institutions in our economy is useful. I am a professor of entrepreneurship at MIT. I am completely supporting that. But if you let these risky enterprises become big relative to the system, when a crisis comes, even if you have a relatively stable core--and I do fully endorse what Mr. Reed is calling for here--you have this rather stable core and you have got very big other parts of the financial system that fail or are in danger of failing, then you let them into the discount window, which is what we did in September of 2008. So the size of these risk-taking parts matters, even if we are able to achieve a stable base, which is what Mr. Reed is rightly arguing for.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Mr. Corrigan, I think you need to have a chance. You should turn on your microphone, because we want to hear this.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Today, the balance sheet side at Goldman Sachs is something in roughly $800 million-plus or something like that, so it has contracted in size relative to what it was a few years ago. But I would also observe that at least half, and perhaps more than half of the growth in Goldman Sachs over the past 10 or 12 years has been international, not in the United States but around the world, and I think that is an important factor, as well. But I really want to focus on these comments about discount windows and discount rates. I completely agree with what John Reed said a few minutes ago about discount window and discount rates. And as I am sure your staffs will note, in my statement----","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I noted it directly.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","----I had two things to say about discount window. One was that as the Fed winds down its heavy crisis intervention, in my judgment, we should go back to the old-days regime of the discount window, and under that old regime, even if you were a bank holding company, the bank itself had access to the discount window, but under the old rules, the bank could not take funds that it got through the discount window and cross-stream them to nonbank affiliates or to the holding company. Once we get this crisis behind us, that is what we should go back to. In addition to that, in my statement, I was very clear in saying that going forward, we need to modify the so-called ``13(3) rules'' as they apply to the extreme emergency situations using the discount window, and what I personally have in mind is something along the lines of what I think is in the House bill, and I think, Senator Dodd, I think you have been contemplating this, as well, is that at a minimum, to use 13(3) under any set of circumstances, the Federal Reserve would have to get the consent of the Treasury. So I am not by a long shot even close to a point of view about the discount window that is anything other than extremely conservative, both for so-called ``regular use'' of the discount window and emergency use. I think that, again, the traditional roles that said a bank in a bank holding company has access to the discount window, that is where we should get back to.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","My time has expired, but I just raise the question--I think like Senator Corker, this will be an ongoing dialogue, but the crisis that we saw last year, getting the permission of the Secretary of Treasury to use 13(3) would not be too hard, because I would suspect he was begging the Federal Reserve to use 13(3). So we have to--and that, I think, is the ultimate. When we talk about ``too big to fail,'' we are basically saying there are some institutions that don't get 13(3). I mean, that is when you cut it to the core.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","I agree with you on that, too, Senator Reed, but if I could, I would like to go back to this interconnectedness question and ``too big to fail'' and resolution authority, because I am convinced, absolutely convinced, that we have to get this resolution authority right. And in my statement, for example, I have laid out a bill of particulars that take the form of prerequisites that have to be in place for every large integrated financial intermediary that would make it possible for resolution authority to work the right way. Every one of these particulars deals in very specific terms with interconnectedness. I don't want to sound like--but I think that over the years, I probably have thought more about interconnectedness and the plumbing of the financial system, as I like to call it, than most everybody. But I think it is urgently important that the regulators, working with the major institutions, have to focus on these prerequisites, because I will tell you that in my judgment, if we don't get that right, we will not be able to close down ``too big to fail.''","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","My time has expired. I thank my colleagues for indulging.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Jack.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair, and thank you all for testifying today on these issues that are so important to our future economic health. Mr. Reed, you noted the question as to why do we rescue Long-Term Capital Management, and you noted that it stood alone, and I think you said, but there is an instinct in the system to save a major player. I want to turn back to that example to pursue that a little bit further. This was at the end of the 1990s and there were a lot of investments by major financial houses in Russian derivatives. If I recall right, Long-Term Capital Management, had it gone under, it would have been selling at fire sale prices. Many of these investments, which I believe we also had a number of large financial houses deeply invested in, including, I believe, Goldman and JPMorgan both had positions that were at risk, and so these other entities came together to help bail out Long-Term Capital Management to avoid at that point interconnections that were driven by market considerations. That is, one piece of the interconnectedness, if one firm fails and has to sell at fire sale prices, it drives down everybody else's asset portfolios. That is another form of interconnectedness or risk in the system. So could those of you who were involved in this or who have studied it share just a little bit more about the lessons to be learned from that setting, that form of risk, how that can be addressed? And it also certainly came up in mortgage-backed securities, the potential for them to be sold, and so forth.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Well, Senator, I think you are absolutely correct as to what drove the rescue, that people felt that it was easier to rescue than to allow it to go broke. But this is why people are going to be very reluctant ever to say we are going to allow a given company to basically go bankrupt, because there is this level of interconnectedness. The lesson we should have derived from that is we didn't have enough capital. There wasn't enough capital in the system to take the risks that were there. And we didn't learn that. Had we learned that with Long-Term----","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Are you speaking of the issue of leverage? I remember at one point----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","There was a tremendous amount of leverage.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","----101 or something like that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Yes, it was tremendous leverage, and what we should have learned was that there wasn't enough capital to absorb the risks that were in the system, and therefore, when the risks manifest themselves, the human reaction is, let us gang together and we will see if we can take this together. Well, we had a situation there that was a one-institution version of what later happened to all of us and where basically the taxpayer had to step in because there wasn't enough capital in the private sector to cover the risks that were manifesting themselves in this crisis we have gone through. And so my question about Long-Term Capital was there was the anatomy of the problem that we are today wrestling with. It was alone that sat there. It was tremendously interconnected. As you say, it had counterparty lines. It had all sorts of assets which conceivably would have been liquidated at very distressed prices and so forth, which would have impacted the market. And yet as a system, we sort of ganged together, papered it over, and went on having learned nothing.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Senator?","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Yes, Mr. Zubrow?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Zubrow","Senator, if I could just add one point, which is that I also think that that is an example of how we allowed fundamental regulatory arbitrage to lead to a very difficult situation. And obviously, Long-Term Capital was outside of the regulatory regime. It wasn't subject to the same capital requirements or oversight as other institutions. And so I think that one of the lessons that we learned from that is that all firms that are systemically important need to come under the same umbrella of regulation, the same capital regimes, and the same oversight of regulators and not allow the form of ownership or the type of business they are in to allow those institutions to escape that type of comprehensive regulation. I would just comment that I, frankly, was somewhat surprised in Secretary Wolin's testimony last week, or on Tuesday, that he suggested that we could sort of allow certain institutions to be able to escape the regulatory situation if they were to divest their banks, and I think that it is very important that in that situation, all organizations that are systemically important be treated the same.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","I will ask both of you to be brief, because I am down to less than a minute. Mr. Scott.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","I think addressing Long-Term Capital Management, the first issue is protecting the institution from failing, capital. But then we come to, well, maybe we will not succeed at that, it is failing. Now we have to deal with interconnectedness. We have done all we can, it wasn't enough. If you look at the present world of interconnectedness, it is not about equity. Equity is not an interconnectedness problem. I do not think it is about debt. I do not think that we are worried particularly from an interconnected point of view who is holding the bank debt. We may have other issues about that. It is really counterparty. It is really derivatives, in my view. And the answer to this is clearinghouses. If you go back to the years when Mr. Corrigan was serving very adequately in the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, his major concern was the payment system, and particularly the clearinghouse interbank payment system, because if there was a default, you would have a systematic chain reaction of failures. What did we do about that? Well, we managed to figure out a way that that thing could function without causing that problem. It now settles continuously. You do not have end of the day large net positions that could endanger the system if there is a settlement failure. So we have to address the same problem now in the context of derivatives. And I think that needs to be the focus here, because that is, in my view, the interconnectedness problem today.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","I am over my time. Shall I allow Mr. Johnson to respond, as well?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","I am afraid we haven't learned the lesson of LTCM, which is the capital that needs to be held with regard to derivative positions is still far too low. And that is where the regulatory arbitrage exists and it is still engaged in on a massive basis every day by the firms represented on this panel. We have not learned that lesson. In my written testimony, we have a very specific proposal about how you can change those capital requirements. But I think it is going to be hard to do because you are going to be fought every inch of the way by the people who make a lot of money on this regulatory arbitrage.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Menendez.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me thank all of our witnesses. As I approach this issue, I look at it as how do we strike the right balance, the appropriate regulations at the end of the day to make sure we don't have another taxpayer bailout, and at the same time the opportunity to make sure that growth can take place in our country. But I have to be honest with you. I was reading through the written testimonies and I get a sense that while we take--it is like a Texas two-step. We claim the veneer of saying that we understand and need reform. And then we have so many caveats to it that we, in essence, undermine the very essence of reform. And that just--that dog simply is not going to hunt because if, in fact, we have what we had in the past, we are destined to relive it again. And I hope the financial institutions, those that are here and others, understand that because they would be far better served in helping us strike the right balance on the pendulum than going ahead and just fighting us tooth and nail. I have got to be honest with you, when I walk the streets of New Jersey, the average person comes up to me and says you know what? When I make a mistake, I have to pay for my mistake. And when they--meaning some of our financial institutions--make a mistake, I also have to pay for their mistake. Something is wrong with that, Senator. And so I think sometimes my friends on the street have a disconnect with average Americans in this country, and it is a dangerous disconnect. It is a dangerous disconnect. I think everybody would be better served in honestly moving forward on this. Let me ask you, Mr. Corrigan, I read your written statement and, you know, on page 10 you say that there is no question that the drive to shrink the size and activities of large and complex financial institutions is understandably driven by the political and public outrage about the use of taxpayer money to bail out institutions that were deemed too big to fail. And then you go on to say that because of that, observers believe that the easiest way to solve the problem is some combination of shrinking the size of these institutions and restricting their activities. But it is really more than the public and political outrage. You are not dismissing the fact that there is a need to actually do something here?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Of course not, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","If you would put your microphone on, I would appreciate it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","I am sorry. Of course not, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","The statement seems sort of like dismissive, in my mind.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Then I did not do a very good job of drafting the statement, because if you look at the second section of that statement, it talks in very concrete detail of what I call the essential financial reform agenda going forward, and it is a line-by-line recitation of the things that I think must be done to get ourselves ahead of the curve for the next problem. I talk, for example, about the need for substantial increases in both capital and liquidity, the need to look at capital and liquidity as a singular integrated discipline. I talk about the enhancements we need to the financial infrastructure. I talk about the improvements we need in supervision and regulation. So again, if that is the interpretation, Senator, that you are drawing, I did not do a very good job of drafting that statement.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Well, let me ask you, do you believe that there is any disconnect between entities like Goldman Sachs and the public at large?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Unfortunately, I would have to agree that there is.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","You know, I think part of that disconnect, when I look at that Goldman has set aside an astronomical sum of $16.2 billion in compensation for 2009, that is 50 percent more than in 2008, and that is happening in a year in which the financial system nearly collapsed and Goldman Sachs received at least $24 billion in taxpayer assistance, including $14 billion from the bailout of AIG. And so I look at that and I look at that in the juxtaposition of what Goldman is trying to do, which I think is laudable, but definitely underfunded in terms of your small business project, where you are basically going to put out maybe $500 million, which is about 3 percent of the amount Goldman has allotted to compensation about 2 percent of the amount Goldman has received in taxpayer assistance, and I say, how is that being responsive to these times? Sixteen-billion dollars in compensation, $500 million to lend to small businesses.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Well, let me respond to that on two levels. First of all, as I said before, I do agree with you that there, unfortunately, is a disconnect here. But having said that, I would just make a couple of observations. First of all, I do think it is entirely accurate to say that the compensation framework at Goldman Sachs as it was amended further this year, I think is consistent to both the letter and the spirit of the various G-20 and other official guidelines on compensation. Now, that doesn't change the facts of the arithmetic, but I think that is a factually accurate statement. With regard to your comment on our small business initiative, I guess, again, I would make two or three observations. First of all, if that initiative turns out to be as successful as the earlier initiative we did on 10,000 women, it will be quite successful. Second, as that program begins to get legs, which is hopefully quite soon, I, for example, look forward personally myself, as being one of the mentors that will work with small business and small business leaders in the New York metropolitan area, and I am not suggesting you can put a price tag on that, but there will be hundreds, I suspect thousands of officials at Goldman Sachs that will be doing that as part of their personal contribution to the thing. And the last point I would make, Senator, is that in the general area of providing financial support to medium-sized businesses and to some extent small businesses, Goldman, as you know, essentially is a wholesale firm. But the fact of the matter is that we are in the process of stepping up our programs and one of our business units aimed at both debt and equity support for small and medium-sized companies. We are in the process also of putting into place in the Goldman Sachs Bank, which is quite small, another program that is specifically targeted and directed at small and medium-sized businesses. So it is not as if I think we are perfect. We are not. But I think we are sensitive to the very issues that you have raised.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Mr. Chairman, if I just may, one last minute----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","You know, I appreciate what you are saying, but the numbers belie it and this is my concern. The 22 banks that received the greatest amount of TARP funding have dropped their small business lending portfolio by $10 billion over the past 6 months. So as I said, your goal at Goldman is desirable, but you are significantly, in my view, underfunding it, especially when I look at the amount of money that is going to compensation. It is, like, 3 percent of that amount. And last, you know, this disconnect--I know people don't want to hear about it, but for a while, it just seems to me that the industry would be best served--the Times of London reported that your CEO is likely to receive even more money this year than his record $68 million a year. Is that true?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","That is nonsense.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Total and absolute nonsense.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","I am glad to hear that, because that is the type of challenge--I mean, $68 million, I am happy for----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Trust me, it is not going to be that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","----to be able to get $68 million, but at the end of the day, if we see that type of reported increases--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","It is not going to happen.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","----it just makes it very difficult----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","It is not going to happen.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","----for people on Main Street to continue to understand why their taxpayer dollars should continue to fund institutions that, one, don't get it; two, fight financial reform; and three, ultimately have them holding the bag. And we need to change that if we want to strike the right balance here. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Senator, please. Personally, I have a great deal of sympathy for everything you have just said.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Very good. As I said earlier, we have a vote that will be occurring shortly, so I am going to ask a couple of quick questions, then I will turn to Senator Shelby and","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","We will stay on as long as we can before we have to leave for the vote. I am not bringing people back. Let me ask you to respond to--other Members to respond to what Professor Scott said earlier, and Senator Corker began that conversation, as well, and it is the interconnectedness issue, John, because I think we have wrestled with that in our conversations, as well. We clearly want--and there is a growing, I think almost unanimous consensus here, although I hesitate to say that until we actually get to the bill itself-- but a consensus about the ``too big to fail'' notion. And I think, again, you have all expressed your views on it, as well. Having said that, and in getting from Point A to Point B, where, again, the interconnectedness issue is not an irrelevant issue in today's economy and probably going to be a growing one in the global economic sense. So to what extent--what is the impact of that, potentially, on institutions' behavior? If we write in this matter here, what is likely to occur if we write this in a way that does make this about as, to use the word euthanasia that Paul Volcker used here, what are the implications of that for you? You have all agreed with this, but what if what Professor Scott raised is accurate and, in fact, you face a situation where one institution should fail. No one questions that at all. What they have engaged in is clearly behavior of their own making, their own fault. Shut them down. Put them in receivership. But a lot of these other healthy companies out there, good companies, operating well, but are connected with the failure of that institution. Is that a legitimate question Professor Scott raises, and if so, what are going to be the behavior changes that will occur institutionally, particularly in global markets? Gerry.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","This is really, Mr. Chairman, the crux of the issue. Let me give you, again, an example or two of the kinds of things we can be doing to make it much easier to deal with interconnectedness when we find ourselves in the very situation that you have described, the next train wreck. One example: Some institutions, certainly Goldman Sachs is one of them, have gone through--and I know about this because it was another one of my ideas--a very rigorous exercise that I call close-out stress test. It is very complicated. I am not going to bother you with the details. But what it is designed to do is to take hypothetical but very real world situations in which you say, just for the hell of it, let us assume that X and Y hit the tank. What do I do? How do I know what my exposures are? What do I do to manage those exposures? What approaches can I or can I not take in terms of closing out positions? Now, I have been arguing--and Barry Zubrow can be my witness--I have been arguing for years that one of the basic standards that should apply to all large integrated financial intermediaries is that those institutions should be able in a matter of a couple of hours to put together counterparty exposures across--to particular counterparties across all products, across all locations, across all markets, both gross and net, and to do that within a couple of hours, because that is how you begin to get your arms around interconnectedness. I, Barry, don't want to get myself too far out on a limb here, but I think I can probably say that the world is not full of institutions that even today can do that. Goldman Sachs can do that, and I suspect JPMorgan can do it, but I am not so sure how far that goes. So that is, again, a very concrete example of the things that we can and must do to put ourselves in a position to better deal with the interconnectedness. This list of prerequisites that is on the last page of my statement for winding down and closeout is another. So I am not ready to accept for 1 minute, and I don't think, Hal, you are, either, that we are hostage to a system that is so complicated that we can't deal with it. I just don't buy that. But I also say we have got a hell of a lot of work to do to get to that point.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Does anyone else want to comment on this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","I think Professor Scott made a very deep point with regard to LTCM, certainly. It is the surprise interconnectedness. Now, maybe we can measure these. Maybe the regulator will catch up, to some degree, with the technology. But you are always going to be surprised in a big crisis. And then I think it comes down to two things. First, how big is this problem relative to the economy? Take CIT Group, for example, that failed last year. CIT Group had a balance sheet of $80 billion. There was a big debate, as you know, in Washington about whether they were too big to fail, and it was decided, rightly, despite their interconnections that were known and unknown, that they could fail--and did fail, have essentially failed--without disrupting the system. That is what we know. That is the biggest financial institution we have let fail and it hasn't had the systemic implications. Eighty- billion, that is what we know. In addition to the size, it is about capital. It is about capital and derivative positions. I mean, that is the part that we know about, the part that Professor Scott and Mr. Reed have been emphasizing. These derivative positions with low capital requirements are asking for trouble. They are still there and they are not going away in the existing framework.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","In fact, Barry raised the issue--I think it was he--do you see any deeper threats with banks that are creating over-the-counter derivatives, for instance. That kind of a matter poses some additional--when you start getting specific about the kind of proprietary trading that can occur, then you do begin to see some potential here for a larger question. Do you agree with that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","Well, I think a lot of the derivatives business is client-based, and so--and hedged--so I am not sure it is a problem. But I think Mr. Corrigan has raised a very good point. As part of our arsenal of weapons against interconnectedness, perhaps there should be a requirement that every large or important financial institution stress test itself, supervised by the regulators, so that they could survive a failure of their major counterparties. This would be basically what Goldman Sachs is doing. I think this is something that every financial institution should do and the regulators should require it.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, go ahead, quickly.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","I have to ask the question, if Goldman Sachs is the gold standard of stress testing, why did they need to be rescued by being converted into a bank holding company in September of 2008? I don't understand. That is a disconnection.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","That is a gross overstatement.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Well, I am not sure if you had a chance to look at Mr. Paulson's book yet. I don't think he regards it as an overstatement.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Well, I mean, clearly, and Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were made bank holding companies at the height of the crisis, and I think that turned out to be a very good thing. As I say in my statement--I was very clear about this-- that we do benefit unquestionably from the intensity of the Federal Reserve's consolidated supervision of Goldman Sachs. But I don't think it follows from any or all of that that the mere fact--the mere fact of making Goldman Sachs a bank holding company constituted a bailout of Goldman Sachs. That is kind of pushing it.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me turn to Senator Shelby.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","A few observations. Professor Scott, on the Volcker Rule, in your judgment, the spirit of the Volcker Rule, I think, is a good idea. It is how you implement it and under what circumstances, how you do it, who would do it. Do regulators at the present time have the power to deal with that, or would we need to give the regulators some specific power outside of what they have, whoever winds up as the regulator--it might not be the Fed--and so forth. Do you have any documents?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","I think they have the power as part of their general safety and soundness responsibility, and examining institutions, if they find----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","But they have got to have the will, haven't they? They have got to have the will.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","Well, that is another question. You know, if I look at the Kanjorski Amendment, for instance, which is basically saying I want to give you this power, OK, to deal with large risks if banks are taking them, it is duplicating--","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","They already have it, don't they?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","----what powers are already there. But it is kind of underlining. Maybe there is a value to that, of just underlining the importance that the Congress sees in exercising that responsibility. But in terms of legally, yes, I think they have the power.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","And what about what Senator Dodd and Senator Corker have raised, and you have, too, on the panel, the problem of interconnectedness? That is in ``too big to fail.''","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","That is the absolute----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Can the regulator deal with that now under the safety and soundness, in your judgment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","Yes. I think if a regulator believed today that an institution that they were supervising were not able to survive the failure of their significant counterparties, they could do something about it. Now, that being said, the ability to understand that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","That is right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","----that is hard.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Professor Johnson.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","I think that the evidence is very clear, that even the FDIC, which is actually pretty good, arguably even world class, at taking over relatively small- and medium-sized banks, even they come in too late. If the FDIC were doing its job properly, we would never need any taxpayer money. They would always come in while there was still enough capital left----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Prevent it, in other words?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Absolutely. Preventive action doesn't take place, even for the relatively less political ones. In terms of the point about the power and the caps here, let me remind you that under the Riegle-Neal Act, there is a cap on the size of our largest banks. That cap was waived every time the big banks asked for it. So JPMorgan Chase, Wells Fargo, and Bank of America all exceed the cap in that law, just because they asked for it. They were allowed to become bigger. So it is the same thing that would happen with all these other----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","And who waived it? The regulator. And who was the regulator? The Federal Reserve, right?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Absolutely.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","OK. Now, as we wrestle with this, we all know, and you know because you spend your life in this as either a professor or consultant or a banker, it is very complex, and as Senator Dodd said, there always--when we raise a question, then it begets another one to deal with. But do you know--do any of you know of any institution, financial institution, that has been well capitalized--we talked about capital here earlier--well capitalized, well managed, Mr. Reed, and well regulated that has failed? Do you?","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I don't, either. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Jack.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you very much. This issue of regulatory capacity, I think is important. Professor Scott, if someone called you up and said, the Fed is threatening me, shutting me down because they think my counterparties are unreliable, could you come up with some legal arguments why the Fed couldn't do that? Is it so clear they have that authority?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","No, I would not say they could shut you down, but what I think they could do is tell you to change your business to get rid of that problem.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Are there any examples where the Fed has actually gone in and told people to change their business?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Scott","That happens every day to banks across the United States.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","But apparently it didn't happen with respect to some critical issues. Mr. Reed, you look like you want to say something. Do you have some experience with this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","I am just smiling because you are absolutely correct. It didn't happen with--I don't think there are many examples where regulatory structures have been able to anticipate these kind of problems. You know, it didn't happen in Germany, which has a very different structure. It didn't happen in England, which has a quite different structure. And it didn't happen in this country.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I want to get to an issue that we have been spending some time on, and that is derivatives. One argument that end users are making is that this would deny them sort of a great financial benefit which would cause them to retract in many different ways. But, Mr. Reed, you ran a major financial institution which presumably did derivatives, end user derivatives?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Did you, when your people were selling these, did you reserve the margin that you needed to cover the risk and did the ultimate end user pay for that margin, or----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Yes. No, I mean, we put caps on the size of the business within the total company. You know, you run these businesses with caps, and this is why I think this argument that you don't know what you are doing just doesn't make any sense. If a trading room has a certain limit to take to have open positions, you know what those limits are. So we did have a derivative function and it was global. In other words, we operated in the derivative markets around the world. But we had limits with regard to positions. We had limits with regard to counterparties. And you run the business so, hopefully, it can't produce a massive problem for the institution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","This is a very lucrative business with banks, and at least one could argue that in either a clearing platform or a trading situation, that this would be much more cost effective for end users. But there seems to be this willingness to pay significantly for these credit default swaps, these over-the-counter devices. What is your sense on that, if I----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Reed","Well, I think what happened is that they didn't attract much capital and so it appeared that you were able to significantly augment your earnings. I mean, what happened is the banks were basically using capital both for their customer business and for their trading businesses and they were doubling up on it. Obviously, this causes your return on capital to go way up. I mean, the Deutsche Bank is a wonderful example. They announced publicly that they were going to get their return on capital up to 20 percent. Anybody who has done business in Germany knows that sort of a natural rate in the German market is maybe 7 or 8 percent. The only way they were able to do that was to build a significant trading and proprietary investing business on top of their banking business, and they did, in fact, achieve that result. They also ducked the great bulk of the problems that we are today confronting. They never did get any form of government assistance in Europe or elsewhere. So it can be done. But the point is, the attractiveness of this kind of activity is that it hasn't brought capital with it and therefore you are basically doubling up and you are able to earn better returns for your stockholders.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Johnson.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Senator, we also have to remember that the ``too big to fail'' is a form of implicit subsidy from the taxpayer, which lowers the cost of funding for these derivative transactions. So one reason the massive banks were able to dominate this market is because they are viewed by the credit markets themselves as too big to fail. That gives them an unfair advantage that enables them to scale up and create even more risk for the taxpayer. The Bank of England financial stability people are calling this entire structure a ``doom loop'' because it is a repeated cycle of boom, bust, bailout, and we are just running through this again.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","We have talked about interrelatedness, and I think that is a theme that everyone agrees to. But, Mr. Johnson, in terms of derivative trading, to what extent is that a key factor in this interrelatedness? I know there is no magic one thing, but it strikes me, given the notional size of derivative trading, given the fact that it inherently is staking your future to somebody else's future, would be one of the key drivers in some of these interrelated issues we have.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Absolutely, Senator. So Mr. Corrigan said a little while ago that the total balance sheet of Goldman Sachs right now is about $800 billion. But what is the balance sheet if you take into account derivative positions? That depends on risk models that they run that they report to other people. Perhaps the regulator has some independent ability to assess that. Perhaps the market has some ability to see through what they are doing. I actually don't think that they do. So derivatives are very important because that is the complexity and it is where a lot of the interconnectedness today is manifested in problems that will always be there, and it is where a great deal of problems occur whenever there is a crisis. We just don't know what is the true balance sheet, what are the true risks, what is the true capital of these financial institutions without relying on their own risk models, and those risk models failed dramatically and repeatedly in the run-up to September of 2008. And with respect to Mr. Corrigan and the idea that Goldman Sachs was not saved by becoming a bank holding company, what would have happened to Goldman Sachs if it had not become a bank holding company, particularly based on its derivative exposure and what had happened in and around AIG?","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","You should turn on your microphone, Mr. Corrigan, because we want to hear you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","This is getting a little frustrating. In terms of derivatives, first of all, as a general matter, and I will come to Goldman Sachs in a minute, the fact of the matter is that over the past few years, there have been substantial improvements made in the entire infrastructure surrounding the way derivatives are traded, the practices for margining, the practices for collateral, the practices for closeout, and we are now, as you know, in the first stages of getting most derivatives through so-called ``CCPs,'' central clearing counterparty things, that clearly is a potentially huge reduction in systemic risk associated with derivatives activities in general. And that effort is still ongoing. I personally am very involved with that effort and Goldman Sachs certainly is one of the most enthusiastic supporters of all of those initiatives. Now, on the risk profile questions, as I think everyone knows, balance sheets are an imperfect indicator of financial profiles in general. But it is also true that in all of the risk metrics that organizations like Goldman Sachs and others use these days, in terms of all forms of stress tests and other contingent-type analyses that are done daily. All aspects of exposures, gross and net, margined, unmargined, et cetera, are taken into account in a context in which risk models in and of themselves are only one metric that is used in this process. And there are literally dozens of other metrics that are used to try to take account of the fact that risk models by their very nature are backward-looking, and as a result, are inherently flawed. We all know that and we try in the best ways that we can to take account of that in terms of how we think about risk. In addition to that, all of the stress tests and other things that are done in risk mitigation efforts are done and are looked at by the authorities, not just in the United States but around the world. So again, I am not Pollyanna-ish. I think I understand the risks associated with derivatives and most other things that you think about as well as anybody else. I spend a substantial part of my time trying to build and help the industry build better mousetraps to be able to deal with risk and risk mitigation. So again, I am sure I make mistakes. I am sure I don't get it right every time. But I also am sure that I have had as much experience over what is now 43 or 44 years in dealing with these questions and these issues on both sides of the street.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","No, we appreciate that, Mr. Corrigan. Your leadership of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was a great contribution.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I have this feeling, though, in terms of regulation that there is a 27-year-old----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","There is.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","----across the table from you talking about why your risk models are wrong, and I think you win that conversation every time, and that is one of the problems we have in terms of----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","I agree with that, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Jack added to the age. I said they were 22 yesterday.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","They spent some time in the Army.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","There you go. That is a good thing to do. Senator Merkley, I am going to let you know we have got a couple of minutes left before the vote closes out, so why don't you go ahead and finish up.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","I have the same microphone problem. There we go. Mr. Corrigan, you seemed a little sensitive when it was suggested that Goldman Sachs was bailed out, if I caught your reaction right there. So to the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Corrigan","Let me just, if I could, be very clear on this. I was reacting more to the specific language that was used. Look, there is no question--none whatsoever--that when you look at the totality of the steps that were taken by central banks and governments, particularly in 2008, that Goldman Sachs was the beneficiary of this. There is no doubt whatsoever about that, as well as everybody else. I mean, that is what those extraordinary measures were all about. So again, I am not suggesting for 1 minute that Goldman Sachs was not a beneficiary of these initiatives. It was, clearly.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Let me--Senator, we have a minute left on the vote on the floor. I will leave the record open, but I am afraid we are going to have to leave ourselves or else we will miss a vote, so we are going to have to terminate the hearing. I apologize.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you all very much.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","And let me thank all of you very, very much. We could literally go on all day. You have been tremendously valuable, your testimony. We would like to follow up with you on some of these ideas and suggestions as we are trying to draft this legislation. I think we need further conversation. Gerry, we thank you for your long testimony you submitted. It is very valuable to have that, as well, as part of the record. John Reed, good to see you again, as well. Hal, we love having you back here. Barry, you are always welcome at the Committee. And Professor Johnson, thank you for your presence here today, as well. The Committee will stand adjourned.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Volcker","There is nothing new about potential conflicts in banking and finance. However, it cannot be denied that in the world of contemporary finance--with all of its complexities and applied technology--managing potential conflicts has become much more challenging. Reflecting that fact of life, so-called ``Chinese Walls'' segregating some business units from others is a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for managing potential conflicts. That is why at Goldman Sachs (and other large integrated intermediaries) conflict management policies and procedures are constantly evolving and improving. Goldman Sachs has established numerous committees and processes to help mitigate potential conflicts. We have a high level Firmwide Business Practices Committee which focuses on operational and reputational risk, including conflict management. We have a dedicated and independent high level worldwide Conflict Management team. We have a Firmwide Risk Committee which focuses on financial risk. The Firm's independent Legal and Compliance divisions, both of which have centralized teams of experts and high level officials who are embedded, but still independent, within all of the revenue producing business units, contribute to conflicts management. All of these committees and business areas are headed by senior officers who sit on the Management Committee. Side by side we have a Suitability Committee and a New Products Committee. In addition, our Capital Committee and Commitments Committee as well as all Division Heads share in the responsibility of helping to manage conflicts and reputational risk. Section IV: The Challenges Associated With Enhanced Resolution Authority There is little doubt that a well designed and well executed framework of Enhanced Resolution Authority can address the Too Big to Fail problem and the related Moral Hazard problem. However, it is also true that a poorly designed and poorly executed approach to Enhanced Resolution Authority could produce renewed uncertainty and instability. Indeed, under the very best of circumstances, the timely and orderly wind-down of any systemically important financial institution-- especially one with an international footprint--is an extraordinarily complex task. That is why, at least to the best of my recollection, we have never experienced such an orderly wind-down anywhere in the world. In other words, even if we successfully implement all of the reforms outlined in Section I of this statement, that success by itself, will not ensure that Enhanced Resolution Authority can achieve its desired effects. Thus, great care must be used in the design of the approach to law and regulation for a system of Enhanced Resolution Authority. I, of course, have no monopoly on thoughts on how to best approach this task. On the other hand, as someone who has devoted much of my career to improving what I like to call the plumbing of the financial system I do have some suggestions as to (1) certain principles that I believe should guide the effort and (2) certain prerequisites that should be in place to guide the execution of a timely and orderly wind- down or merger of a failing systemically important financial institution. Guiding Principles First; the authorizing legislation and regulations must not be so rigid as to tie the hands of the governmental bodies that will administer those laws and regulations because it is literally impossible to anticipate the future circumstances in which the authorities will be required to act. Second; in my judgment, the authority and responsibility to carry out Enhanced Resolution Authority in a given situation should be vested in governmental bodies that have sufficient experience with the type of institution being resolved. Third; Enhanced Resolution Authority should be administered using the ongoing approach which probably means the troubled institution would be placed into temporary conservatorship or a similar vehicle allowing that institution to continue to perform and meet its contractual obligations for a limited period of time. As a precondition for conservatorship, one or more of the Executive Officers and the Board of the institution would be removed. The ongoing approach has many benefits including (1) preserving the value of assets that might be sold at a later date; (2) minimizing the dangerous and panic prone process of simultaneous close out by all counterparties and the need of such counterparties to then replace their side of many of the closed-out positions; and (3) reducing, but by no means eliminating, the very difficult and destabilizing cross-border events that could otherwise occur as witnessed in the Lehman episode. However, the ongoing approach is not without its problems, one of which is the sensitive question of how well an institution in conservatorship for a limited period of time can fund itself. Fourth: to the maximum extent possible, the rights of creditors and the sanctity of existing contractual rights and obligations need to be respected. Indeed, if the exercise of Enhanced Resolution Authority is seen to arbitrarily violate creditor rights or override existing contractual agreements between the troubled institution and its clients, its creditors, and its counterparties, the goal of orderly wind-down could easily be compromised and the resultant precedent could become a destabilizing source of ongoing uncertainty. Finally; the orderly wind-down of any large institution-- particularly such an institution having a global footprint--is a highly complex endeavor that will take patience, skill and effective communication and collaboration with creditors, counterparties and other interested parties. Shrinking a balance sheet or selling distinct businesses or classes of assets or liabilities may prove relatively simple but the winding down of trading positions, hedges, positions in financial ``utilities'' such as payments, clearance and settlement systems is quite another matter. Prerequisites for Success: First; as a part of the reform of supervisory policy and practice, supervisory authorities responsible for systemically important institutions must work to insure that ``prompt corrective action'' becomes a reality not merely a slogan. Second; the official community must work with individual systemically important institutions to ensure that all such institutions have--or are developing--the systems and procedures to provide the following information in a timely fashion. Comprehensive data on all exposures to all major counterparties and estimates of all such exposures of counterparties to the failing institution Valuations consistent with prevailing market conditions that are available across a substantially complete range of the firm's asset classes (including derivative and securities positions) Accurate and comprehensive information on a firm's liquidity and the profiles of its assets and liabilities Fully integrated, comprehensive risk management frameworks capable of assessing the market, credit, and liquidity risks associated with the troubled institution Legal agreements and transaction documents that are available in an organized, accessible form Comprehensive information on the firm's positions with exchanges, clearing houses, custodians and other institutions that make up the financial system's infrastructure I am under no illusion that these guiding principles and prerequisites are anything close to the last word in seeking assurances that Enhanced Resolution Authority can deliver on the promise of a stability driven solution to the ``Too Big to Fail'' problem. On the other hand, I very much hope these suggestions will help to stimulate discussion and debate on this critically important subject.","Statement","PREPARED STATEMENT OF E. GERALD CORRIGAN"
