Speaker,Speech
Chairman Reed," Let me call the hearing to order and welcome our witnesses. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We expect momentarily that the Ranking Member will arrive, and I thank Senator Corker and Senator Menendez for joining us.
    Today's hearing will focus on corporate boardrooms and try to help us better understand the misaligned incentives that drove Wall Street executives to take harmful risks with the life savings and retirement income of so many people. This Subcommittee has held several hearings in recent months to focus on gaps in our financial regulatory system, including the largely unregulated markets for over-the-counter derivatives, hedge funds, and other private investment pools.
    We have also examined problems that resulted from regulators simply failing to use the authority they had, such as our hearing in March that uncovered defective risk management systems at major financial institutions.
    But although regulators play a critical role in policing the markets, they will always struggle to keep up with evolving and cutting-edge industries. Today's hearing will examine how we can better empower shareholders to hold corporate boards accountable for their actions and make sure that executive pay and other incentives are used to help companies better focus on long-term performance goals over day-to-day profits. In this latter regard, this is a timely hearing based on the action yesterday of the House Financial Services Committee.
    Wall Street executives who pursued reckless products and activities they did not understand brought our financial system to this crisis. Many of the boards that were supposed to look out for shareholders' interests failed at this most basic of jobs. This hearing will help determine where the corporate governance structure is strong, where it needs improvement, and what role the Federal Government should play in this effort.
    I will ask our witnesses what the financial crisis has revealed about current laws and regulations surrounding corporate governance, including executive compensation, board composition, election of directors and other proxy rules, and risk management. In particular, we will discuss proposals to improve the quality of boards by increasing shareholder input into board membership and requiring annual election of and majority voting for each board member.
    We will also discuss requiring ``say-on-pay,'' or shareholder endorsements of executive compensation. We need to find ways to help public companies align their compensation practices with long-term shareholder value and for financial institutions overall firm safety and soundness. We also need to ensure that compensation committee members who play key roles in setting executive pay are appropriately independent from the firm managers that they are paying.
    Other key proposals would require public companies to create risk management activities on their boards and separate the chair and CEO positions to ensure that the CEO is held accountable by the board and an independent chair.
    I hope today's hearing will allow us to examine these and other proposals and take needed steps to promote corporate responsiveness to the interests of shareholders, and I welcome today's witnesses and look forward to the testimony.
    Now let me recognize Senator Bunning.
                STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING
    Senator Bunning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry I am just a little late. Phone calls are a pain right now.
    This is a very important topic for us, but a hard one to deal with. While we may be able to make some reforms that will promote good long-term performance and responsible behavior, we will not, I say, be able to prevent bad decisions or failures. After all, we cannot legislate good judgment or ethics. And we already have the ultimate form of accountability through bankruptcy.
    In general, pay should promote good long-term performance, and shareholders must share in the gain, not just executives and traders. Boards must be more involved--I say that again: Boards must be more involved and be an effective check on management. Proxy access must benefit the majority of stockholders and encourage long-term values. If we are not careful, those changes could have the exact opposite effect by empowering a minority of shareholders to strip the company of value and encourage risky behavior in search of short-term profits.
    While we are right to be outraged at what has gone on in the financial sector, we must be careful that efforts to rein in Wall Street's behavior do not put handcuffs on other businesses that have different needs and challenges. Corporate law for the first 230-plus years of this country has been handled pretty well at the State level, and if we are going to change that, we should be sure of what we are doing. And I am sure looking forward to hearing what our panel has to say.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Senator Bunning.
    Senator Corker, do you have any opening comments?
    Senator Corker. As always, I prefer to listen to the witnesses and ask questions, but thank you all for being here.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Schumer has arrived, and I know he has taken a leadership role on this issue of corporate governance with his legislative proposals and his constant attention. In fact, it was Senator Schumer's suggestion that we hold this hearing, so I want to recognize him for any comments that he might have.
            STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. SCHUMER
    Senator Schumer. Well, thank you, Senator Reed, and let me express my profound gratitude to you for holding this hearing and to Ranking Member Bunning for being here as well on such an important subject.
    As you acknowledged, Mr. Chairman, corporate governance is of great importance to me, and I introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights with Senator Cantwell earlier this year. The bill was supported by 20 major pension funds, consumer groups, labor unions, and just yesterday, the House Financial Services Committee passed a ``say-on-pay'' bill similar to the ``say-on-pay'' we have in the Shareholder Bill of Rights. So I am glad to see Congress is moving forward in this process, and today's hearing is a great opportunity to get a chance to explore these issues in more detail.
    In the last year-plus, we have talked a great deal about the failures of regulation and Government oversight in the financial system. But our dynamic economy and capital markets also depend on internal oversight by vigilant boards of directors who ensure that management is steering the ship in the right direction.
    Unfortunately, there are far too many cases recently where boards of directors, not just regulators, were asleep at the wheel, or even complicit in practices that caused great harm to our economy and shook public confidence in our capital markets. Executives who encouraged risk-taking that they did not understand were not checked by their boards. Compensation packages that rewarded short-term actions but not long-term thinking were not undone by their boards.
    Fundamentally, too many boards neglected their most important job: prioritizing the long-time health of their firms and their shareholders and carefully overseeing management. In other words, there was widespread failure of corporate governance that has proven disastrous not just for individual businesses but for the economy as a whole.
    And there are many in this room on both sides of the aisle who say, you know, the Government cannot get involved in the details of what a company does. And that is right. That is our free market system. But the place that there is supposed to be a check is in the board of directors, and when over the years in too many companies--there are many companies that have good boards and many companies that already have implemented many if not all the reforms in our bill. But in too many companies, the boards did not do the job.
    And the damage. What if the board of AIG had checked some of its actions? What is the board of Bear Stearns had checked some of its actions? The taxpayers probably would have saved hundreds of billions of dollars. So it affects all of us. It is not just the internals of the company.
    And so Senator Cantwell introduced our bill. It makes corporate boards accountable to the shareholders whose interests they are supposed to protect. The Shareholder Bill of Rights will go a long way to making sure that these failures do not happen again, and as everyone knows, there are six key components in our bill. I am not going to read them. I am going to save that in the interest of time.
    Several elements of the bill have already been in place, as I said, by many corporations, and that is important to remember, because for many corporations, these are already best practices. Well-run companies do not fear their shareholders because they recognize that boards, management, and shareholders share the same interests: long-term growth and profitability. The greatest damage occurs not when boards are too active, but when they are not active enough.
    I think the Shareholder Bill of Rights will go a long way to ensuring that companies are responsive to their shareholders' interests. I thank you and congratulate you, Chairman Reed, for putting together an excellent panel. I look forward to the hearing, the testimony of the witnesses, and I would ask that my entire statement be put in the record.
"
Chairman Reed," Without objection, all statements will be put in the record.
    Senator Corker, do you have a comment?
    Senator Corker. Mr. Chairman, this is an unusual request. I do not really know what those six elements are, and I think since it sounds like----
    Senator Schumer. Since you ask----
    Senator Corker. This has not been a highly debated bill. Since I sense this hearing has a lot to do with the fact that this bill is being introduced, it might be good for all of us to know what those six elements are?
    Senator Schumer. OK. May I read them, Mr. Chairman? It will take a minute.
"
Chairman Reed," Absolutely. This is----
    Senator Schumer. Unusual.
"
Chairman Reed," Unusual. Usually, you do not need encouragement.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Corker. Let me say this. I want to, for the record, note that I usually do not like to hear any opening comments, but in this case, since----
    Senator Schumer. Yes, well, thank you. And I was going to say, similar to what Jack Reed said, this is the first time that someone has asked Chuck Schumer to say more on a subject than he has said. Here they are.
    First, we require all public companies hold an advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation and obtain shareholder approval for golden parachutes.
    Second, we instruct the SEC to issue rules allowing long-term shareholders with significant stakes in the company to have access to the company's proxy form if they want to nominate directors to the board. If you are going to try to keep the board honest, you ought to have access to proxies. Now it is next to impossible for people to get.
    Third, it requires boards of directors to receive a majority of the vote in uncontested elections in order to remain on the board. It makes no sense for board members to be reelected if the majority of shareholders casting ballots vote against them.
    Fourth, it eliminates staggered boards which insulate board members from the consequences of their decisions by requiring all directors to face election annually.
    Fifth, it requires public companies to split the jobs of CEO and chairman of the board and requires the chairman to be an independent director. That one has gotten the most pushback from the corporate world. That surprised me, but that is the facts.
    And, sixth, and finally, requires public companies to create a separate risk committee containing all independent directors to assess the risks that the company is undertaking.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Corker.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you both.
    We have been joined by Senator Warner. I wonder if you have any opening comments, Senator.
    Senator Warner. I will--have I missed testimony already?
"
Chairman Reed," No, you have not.
    Senator Warner. I am anxiously looking forward to the testimony.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you. Now let me introduce our witnesses.
    Our first is Ms. Meredith B. Cross, the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to joining the staff in June 2009, Ms. Cross was a partner at Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale & Dorr in Washington, DC, where she advised clients on corporate and securities matters, was involved with the full range of issues faced by public and private companies in capital raising and financial reporting. Prior to joining Wilmer Hale, Ms. Cross worked at the SEC from 1990 to 1998 in various capacities, including chief counsel and deputy director of the division she now leads.
    Our next witness is Professor John C. Coates. Professor Coates is the John F. Cogan, Jr. Professor of Law and Economics at Harvard Law School. He joined the faculty in 1997 after practicing at the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz where he was a partner specializing in mergers and acquisitions, corporate and securities law, and the regulation of financial institutions. He is a member of the Legal Advisory Committee of the New York Stock Exchange, and he is the author of a number of articles on corporate, securities, and financial institution law and for 7 years coauthored the leading annual survey of development and financial institution M&A.

     STATEMENT OF MEREDITH B. CROSS, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF 
    CORPORATION FINANCE, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
    Ms. Cross. Good afternoon, Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Meredith Cross, and I am Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As you noted, I just rejoined the SEC staff in June of this year after more than 10 years in private practice here in Washington. I worked at the SEC for most of the 1990s, and I am delighted to be back at the agency at this critical time in the regulation of our financial markets. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Commission today on the topics of corporate governance and the agency's ongoing efforts to assure that investors have the information they need to make informed voting and investment decisions.
    Good corporate governance is essential to investor confidence in the markets, and it cannot exist without transparency--that is, timely and complete disclosure of material information. In responding to the market crisis and erosion of investor confidence, the Commission has identified and taken steps over the past months in a number of significant areas where the Commission believes enhanced disclosure standards and other rule changes may further address the concerns of the investing public.
    Two months ago, the Commission voted to approve proposals designed to help shareholders more effectively exercise their State law right to nominate directors. Under the proposals, shareholders who otherwise have the right to nominate directors at a shareholder meeting would, subject to certain conditions, be able to include a limited number of nominees in the company proxy materials that are sent to all shareholders whose votes are being solicited. Shareholders also would have an expanded ability to include in company proxy materials shareholder proposals addressing this important topic. In addition, the Commission recently proposed amendments to its proxy rules to enhance the disclosure that is provided to shareholders in company proxy statements, a key document in shareholders' voting decisions on the election of directors.
    Under the proposals, shareholders would receive expanded information about the qualifications of directors and director candidates, the board's leadership structure and role in risk management, and potential conflicts of interest of compensation consultants, in addition to enhanced disclosure concerning the company's compensation policies and whether they create incentives for employees to act in a way that creates risks that are not aligned with the company's objectives. The proposal also would improve the reporting of annual stock and option awards to company executives and directors and would require quicker reporting of shareholder vote results.
    The Commission also recently proposed amendments to the proxy rules to clarify the requirements consistent with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2009 for a ``say-on-pay'' vote at public companies that have received and not repaid financial assistance under the TARP and approved changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules to prohibit brokers from voting shares held in street name in director elections unless they have received specific voting instructions from their customers.
    Finally, the Commission has asked the staff to undertake this year a comprehensive review of other potential improvements to the proxy voting system and shareholder communications rules. The Commission looks forward to hearing from the public on the outstanding proposals and to carefully considering all views in moving forward over the coming months.
    Thank you again for inviting me to appear before you today and for the Subcommittee's support of the agency in its efforts at this critical time for our Nation's investors. The Commission will remain vigilant in its efforts to support strong corporate governance and disclosure practices and also stands ready to lend whatever assistance it can to the work that is going on outside the agency on these important topics.
    I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Ms. Cross.
    Professor Coates. STATEMENT OF JOHN C. COATES IV, JOHN F. COGAN, JR., PROFESSOR 
            OF LAW AND ECONOMICS, HARVARD LAW SCHOOL
"
Mr. Coates," Thank you, Senator Reed, thank you, Ranking Member Bunning, and the rest of the Members of the Committee who are. I very much appreciate the opportunity to talk about corporate governance.
    Good corporate governance is an essential foundation to economic growth, and so this could not be a more important time for the Congress to be focusing on it.
    There are a large number of reforms--six in Senator Schumer's bill alone, and there are many others--that we could talk about. I am going to talk about a few. I am happy to talk about others that you may have questions about or want to explore. But before I talk about specifics, let me make two general remarks that I think should be kept in mind in thinking about any particular reform.
    First, and maybe a little controversially, I think it is fair to say that the academic perspective on corporate governance would view financial firms differently than other kinds of corporations, and not in the straightforward way that you might think; that is to say, shareholders of financial firms want financial firms to take risk and want them to take more risk than may be appropriate from the perspective of the taxpayer. That is because many of the large financial institutions are, as we have learned, too big, too complex to fail, so that from the shareholders' perspective, if things go well with the risks that the companies take, they are on the upside; and if things go badly, then in the end it is the taxpayer who helps defray the costs to the shareholders.
    As a result of that, I do not think that it would be a good idea to give shareholders considerably more power in the governance of large financial institutions. I think, in fact, if anything, financial regulators should be given more authority to check the power that shareholders have, at least on particular issues--compensation being one. The compensation structures and incentives that shareholders, even if the boards are doing exactly the right thing for shareholder, that shareholders want of large banks are not the ones that are going to be the most safe and most sound from the perspective of the American public. So that is the first general remark.
    Second is across the board on this, I think it is fair to say that academic and scientific research more generally is quite weak. It is evolving. There is almost no nontrivial issue in corporate governance about which there is not fierce academic as well as political argument. That cautions against passing rules that are fixed, mandatory, and are hard to change over time. Instead, it cautions for giving shareholders the ability to adopt rules for their own companies, facilitating collective action by them--and that is an important role, I think, that regulation can play. Shareholders of public companies are dispersed, cannot easily act on their own, and often face entrenched boards who are unwilling to make changes when they are, in fact, the best thing for the companies.
    The caution about the weakness of the scientific evidence is also not a reason to do nothing because what I just said is one thing that there is general consensus on. Disperse shareholders have a hard time acting for themselves as the number of shareholders increase. And the other general consensus, I would say, across the board is that corporate governance in the United States in the last 10 to 20 years has not performed terribly well at a large number of companies. And so there is need for change, and there is need for carefully considered moderate reforms of a kind that can be revised over time as learning on these subjects grows.
    So on the specifics, let me say quickly, I think the evidence that we do have is that ``say-on-pay'' is a good idea, and I am happy to expound on that beyond that bottom-line conclusion.
    I would say for large companies, splitting CEOs from chairmen has some evidence behind it that that is a good thing. Smaller companies, I am not so sure the evidence is there. But as long as the SEC is given appropriate authority to tailor any legislation in this area, I think that would be a good thing to pursue.
    I would say that staggered boards, the evidence, if anything, runs against eliminating them. They are an important option between, on the one hand, a fully contestable corporate governance structure where every director is up for election every year, and a governance structure where essentially the insiders have complete control, as in the case of Google, which is a reasonably successful company. In between, staggered boards have proven to be a type of governance structure that investors and new IPOs have been willing to put their money behind, and to ban them across the board I don't think is supported by the evidence at the moment.
    On shareholder access, just to wrap up, frankly there is no evidence, and I think there is--that is a reason to proceed, but to proceed cautiously, to proceed through the SEC, and here I think the SEC already has adequate authority to pursue this topic. But the one thing Congress probably could clarify is exactly what their authority is in this area, and I think that would be a good thing.
    With that, thank you.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Professor Coates.
    Ms. Yerger.
    STATEMENT OF ANN YERGER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COUNCIL OF 
                    INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
    Ms. Yerger. Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the opportunity to share the council's views on the very important issues under consideration today.
    By way of introduction, council members are responsible for safeguarding assets used to fund the retirement of millions of individuals throughout the United States. They are capitalists, responsible for an aggregate portfolio of somewhere north of $3 trillion in assets. They have a very significant commitment to the domestic markets, on average investing about 60 percent of their portfolios in stocks and bonds of U.S. public companies. And they are long-term, patient investors due to their long investment horizons and their very heavy commitment to passive investment strategies.
    Council members have been very deeply impacted by the financial crisis, and they have a vested interest in ensuring that the gaps and shortcomings exposed by this crisis are repaired. Clearly, a review and restructuring of the U.S. financial regulatory model are necessary steps toward restoring investor confidence and protecting against a repeat of these failures. But regulatory reform alone is insufficient. Corporate governance failures also contributed to this crisis, and as a result, governance reforms are an essential piece of the reform puzzle.
    Failures of board oversight, of enterprise risk, and executive pay were clear contributors to this crisis. In particular, far too many boards structured and approved executive pay programs that motivated excessive risk-taking and paid huge rewards, often with little or no downside risk, for short-term results. Current corporate governance rules also failed by denying owners of U.S. companies the most basic rights to hold directors accountable. The council believes governance reforms in four areas are essential, and, Senator Schumer, they will be familiar to you.
    First, Congress should mandate majority voting for directors of all U.S. public companies. It is a national disgrace that under most State laws the default standard for uncontested director elections is a plurality vote, which means that a director is elected even if a majority of the shares are withheld from the nominee. The corporate law community has taken baby steps to accommodate majority voting, and some companies have volunteered to adopt majority voting, but sometimes only when pressured by shareowners.
    But while many of the largest U.S. companies have adopted majority voting, plurality voting still dominates at small and midsized U.S. companies. This is a fundamental flaw in our governance model. Given the failure by the States, particularly Delaware, to lead this reform, the council believes that the U.S. Congress must legislate this important and most basic shareowner right.
    Second, Congress should affirm the SEC's authority to promulgate rules allowing owners to place their director nominees on management's proxy card. The council believes a modest proxy access mechanism would substantially contribute to the health of our U.S. governance model by making boards more responsive to shareowners, more thoughtful about whom they nominate, and more vigilant about their oversight responsibilities.
    The council commends the SEC for its leadership on this important reform, but, unfortunately, the SEC may face unnecessary, costly, and time-consuming litigation in response to any approved access mechanism. To ensure that owners of U.S. companies face no needless delays over the effective date of this critical reform, the council recommends congressional affirmation of the SEC's authority.
    Third, Congress should pass legislation mandating annual advisory votes on executive pay, explore strengthening clawback standards, and support the SEC's efforts to enhance executive pay disclosures.
    Council members have a vested interest in ensuring that U.S. companies attract, retain, and motivate the highest-performing employees and executives. But as highlighted by this crisis, they are harmed when poorly structured pay programs reward go-for-broke, short-term performance that ultimately harms the company's long term.
    The council believes executive pay issues are best addressed by: first, requiring companies to provide full disclosure of key elements of pay; second, ensuring that directors can be held accountable for their pay decisions through majority voting and access mechanisms; third, by giving shareowners oversight of executive pay via annual nonbinding votes; and, fourth, by requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains.
    One technical suggestion. We recommend that legislation mandating annual advisory votes stipulate that these are a nonroutine matter for purposes of New York Stock Exchange Rule 452.
    Fourth, Congress should mandate that all corporate boards be chaired by an independent director. The council believes separating these positions appropriately reflects differences in the roles, provides a better balance of power between the CEO and the board, and facilitates strong, independent board leadership and functioning.
    In closing, empirical evidence from around the globe supports these reforms. The experiences in other countries and, where applicable, here in the United States are powerful evidence that these reforms are not harmful to the markets and, of note, these measures do not reward short-termism. On the contrary, they are tools to enable owners to think and act for the long term.
    Thank you for your consideration of these important issues, and I look forward to answering any questions.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Ms. Yerger.
"
Mr. Castellani,"STATEMENT OF JOHN J. CASTELLANI, PRESIDENT, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE
"
Mr. Castellani," Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bunning, Members of the Committee. I am John Castellani, President of the Business Roundtable.
    The Business Roundtable has long been at the forefront of efforts to improve corporate governance. We have, in fact, been issuing best practice statements in this area for more than three decades. All of those best practice statements are driven by one principle: To further U.S. companies' ability to create jobs, product service benefits, and shareholder value that improve the well-being of all Americans.
    At the outset, I must respectfully take issue with the premise that the most significant cause of the current financial crisis was problems in corporate governance. The financial crisis likely stemmed from a variety of complex factors, including failures of the regulatory system, over-leveraged financial markets, a real estate bubble, as well as failures in risk management.
    The recently established Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission is just starting its work, and any attempt to make policy in response to the purported causes would seem premature. In fact, to do so could well exacerbate factors that may have contributed to the crisis, such as the emphasis on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainable growth.
    Moreover, the problems giving rise to the financial crisis occurred at a specific group of companies, financial institutions. Responding by enacting a one-size-fits-all corporate governance regime applicable to all 12,000 publicly traded companies really does not make much sense. This approach fails to consider a number of factors that I would like to spend the remainder of my time this afternoon discussing.
    First, there has been sweeping transformation of corporate governance practices in the past 6 years, many of which have been proactively adopted by companies. For example, the average board independence of S&P 1500 companies increased from 69 percent in 2003 to 78 percent in 2008. That same group of companies that have a separate chairman of the board increased from 30 percent in 2003 to 46 percent in 2008. Many companies have appointed an independent lead or presiding director who, among other things, presides over executive sessions of the independent directors. Companies have adopted majority voting standards for the election of directors. In fact, more than 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies have done so. And many companies have moved to the annual election of directors.
    Second, applying a single one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance regardless of a company's size, shareholder base, and other circumstances simply will not work. While there is a multitude of guidance about best practices in corporate governance, each company must periodically assess the practices that will best enable it to operate most effectively to create long-term shareholder value.
    In this regard, we share the concerns recently expressed by New Jersey Investment Council in the letter to SEC Chairman Schapiro, that it is, quote, ``troubled by the proliferation of rigid, prescriptive responses which are costly, time consuming, unresponsive to individual fact settings surrounding specific companies and industries, and which may correlate only randomly with the creation of shareholder value.''
    Third, for more than 200 years, State corporate law has been the bedrock upon which the modern business corporation has been created and has thrived. It remains the most appropriate and effective source of corporate governance. In large part, this stems from the flexibility provided by its enabling nature and by its responsiveness in adjusting to current developments. The amendments to Delaware and other States' laws over the past several years have facilitated majority voting and director elections, and the very recent amendments in Delaware law to facilitate proxy access and proxy reimbursement bylaws are examples of this responsiveness and flexibility.
    Fourth, to the extent that shareholders desire change in a particular company's corporate governance, many avenues are available to them to make their views known and for companies to respond. For example, shareholders may seek to have their proposals included in company proxy statements. In recent years, many companies have responded to these proposals by adopting significant corporate governance changes, including majority voting for directors, special meetings called by shareholders, and the elimination of super-majority voting requirements. Recently, some companies have implemented an advisory vote on compensation, so-called ``say-on-pay,'' in response to shareholder proposals. Shareholders often engage in withhold campaigns against particular directors. And further, shareholders can engage in proxy contests to elect their director nominees to a company's board.
    Finally, the SEC has an important role in seeing that shareholders receive the disclosures that they need to make informed decisions. In this regard, the SEC has issued a number of corporate governance-related proposals that are aimed at improving disclosure about director experience, board leadership structure, oversight of risk management, executive compensation, and potential conflicts of interest with compensation consultants. The Business Roundtable generally supports those.
    Another more controversial SEC proposal seeks to amend the proxy rules to permit shareholders to nominate directors in a company's proxy materials. We have serious concerns with this proposal, and we will share those concerns with the SEC in our comments. But briefly, we believe that the adoption of this proposal could promote short-termism, deter qualified directors from serving on corporate boards, and lead to the election of special interest directors, increase the influence of the proxy advisory services, and highlight voting integrity problems in the system.
    In closing, let me emphasize the Roundtable's commitment to effective governance practices and enabling U.S. companies to compete globally, create jobs, and generate economic growth. However, we must be careful that in a zeal to address our current financial crisis, we do not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that can undermine the stability of boards of directors and place companies under even greater pressure for short-term performance. We must be cautious that we don't jeopardize the engine of American wealth and prosperity.
    Thank you.

Mr. Verret," Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and distinguished Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify in this forum today. My name is J.W. Verret. I teach corporate law at George Mason Law School. I am a Senior Scholar with the Mercatus Center Financial Markets Working Group, and I also run the Corporate federalism Initiative, a network of scholars dedicated to studying the intersection of State and Federal authority in corporate governance.
    I will begin by addressing proxy access and executive compensation rules under consideration, neither of which address the current financial crisis and both of which may result in significant unintended consequences. Then I will close with a list of factors that did contribute to the present financial crisis.
    I am concerned that some of the corporate governance proposals recently advanced impede shareholder voice in corporate elections. This is because they leave no room for investors to design corporate governance structures appropriate for their particular circumstances and particular companies. Rather than expanding shareholder choice, the proxy reform and ``say-on-pay'' proposals before this committee actually stand in the way of shareholder choice. Most importantly, they do not permit a majority of shareholders to reject the Federal approach.
    The Director of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters said it best. Quote, ``We think less is more. Fewer votes and less often would allow us to put more resources toward intelligent analysis.'' The Brotherhood of Carpenters opposes the current proposal out of concern about compliance costs. The proposals at issue today ignore their concerns, as well as concerns of many other investors.
    Consider why one might limit shareholders from considering alternative means of shareholder access. It can only be because a majority of shareholders at many companies might reject the Federal approach if given the opportunity. Not all shareholders share the same goals. Public pension funds run by State elected officials and union pension funds are among the most vocal proponents of the proposals before this committee. There are many examples where they used their power, their existing shareholder power, toward their own special interests. Main Street investors deserve the right to determine whether they want the politics of unions and State pension funds to take place in their 401(k)s.
    The current proposals also envision more disclosure about compensation consultants. Such a discussion would be incomplete without mentioning conflicts faced by proxy advisory firms like RiskMetrics, an issue the current proposals have failed to address.
    In addition, I will note that there is no evidence that executive compensation played a role in the current crisis. If executive compensation were to blame for the present crisis, we would see significant difference between compensation policies at those companies that recently returned their TARP money and those needing additional capital. We do not.
    Many of the current proposals also seek to undermine and take legislative credit for efforts currently underway at the State level and in negotiations between investors and boards. This is true on proxy access, the subject of recent rule making at the State level, and it is true for Federal proposals on staggered boards, majority voting, and independent chairmen.
    We have run this experiment before. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 was an unprecedented shift in corporate governance, designed to prevent poor management practices. Between 2002, when Sarbanes-Oxley was passed, and 2008, the managerial decisions that led to the current crisis were in full swing. I won't argue that Sarbanes-Oxley caused the crisis, but this does suggest that corporate governance reform at the Federal level does a poor job of preventing crisis.
    And yet the financial crisis of 2008 must have a cause. I commend this Committee's determination to undercover it, but challenge whether corporate governance is, in fact, the culprit. Let me suggest six alternative contributing factors for this Committee to investigate.
    One, the moral hazard problems created by the prospect of Government bailout.
    Two, the market distortions caused by subsidization of the housing market through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal tax policy.
    Three, regulatory failure by the banking regulators and the SEC in setting appropriate risk-based capital reserve requirements for investment in commercial banks.
    Four, short-term thinking on Wall Street, fed by institutional investor fixation on firms making and meeting quarterly earnings predictions.
    Five, a failure of credit-rating agencies to provide meaningful analysis caused by an oligopoly in the credit-rating market supported by regulation.
    Six, excessive write-downs in asset values under mark-to-market accounting, demanded by accounting firms who refuse to sign off on balance sheets out of concern about exposure to excessive litigation risk.
    Corporate governance is the foundation of American capital markets. Shifting that foundation requires deliberation and a respect for the roles of States in corporate governance. Eroding that foundation risks devastating effects for capital markets.
    Thank you for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to answering your questions.

Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Professor.
    Mr. Ferlauto, please.
         STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. FERLAUTO, DIRECTOR OF
          CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PENSION INVESTMENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Good afternoon, Chairman Reed and Members of the Committee. My name is Rich Ferlauto. I am Director of Corporate Governance and Pension Investment for AFSCME, the public employee union.
    Our union has a long-term abiding interest in the health of the capital markets. Our 1.6 million members are invested through public pension systems that have assets over $1 trillion. They depend on those assets for long-term retirement security. Those public pension systems have got time horizons of 20 to 30 years in which they need to pay out our member benefits so that we are a long-time, long-term investor with those types of time horizons.
    I might also mention that AFSCME and the AFSCME Pension Fund early on sued AIG over proxy access rights because we understood that the board had failed to do the type of risk disclosure that we felt was necessary and part of the responsibility of directors.
    I am also Chairman of Shareowners.org, a new nonprofit, nonpartisan social networking organization designed to give voice to retail shareholders who rarely have opportunities to communicate with regulators, policy makers, and companies in which they are invested.
    I am here today to urge your focus on corporate governance. We believe that corporate governance reform is essential to good performing capital markets, and, in fact, with greater corporate governance and shareholder rights, we could have avoided some of the $11 trillion in asset loss that was faced and felt dearly by our members and certainly the U.S. households.
    According to a recent public opinion survey by the Opinion Research Corporation conducted for Shareowners, investors want to see Congress take strong action to fix financial markets and to clean up Wall Street. Such action, we believe, is essential in order for you to rebuild confidence in the markets. Capital markets will not work without investors. Investors will not come back if they don't have confidence that the markets are running appropriately.
    Support for such action is strong across all age, income, and educational and political affiliations. Thirty-four percent of the investors that we surveyed used the term ``angry'' to describe their views. The number one reason for the loss of investor confidence in the market, we found, were ``overpaid CEOs and/or unresponsive management and boards'' at 81 percent. Six out of ten investors said that strong Federal action would help restore their confidence in the fairness of the markets.
    When we queried them about policy preferences, the survey found that four out of five American investors agreed that shareholders should be permitted to be actively involved in CEO pay. Eighty-two percent agreed that shareholders should have the ability to nominate and elect directors. And 87 percent of investors who lose their retirement savings to fraud and abuse should have the right to go to court to reclaim that money.
    Fully consistent with these findings, we think that the Committee should focus on fixing corporate governance. The core to fixing corporate governance is to focus on the directors and the responsibility between asset owners and their agents, directors on corporate boards. The most critical change to do that is to create a proxy access right so that shareholders, particularly long-term shareholders who own patient capital in the markets, so that they may cost effectively nominate candidates for election to boards.
    We are very encouraged that the SEC is in the process of rule making on this issue but also believe that this is such an important right that it should not become a political football for future commissions. There needs to be long-term consistency in securities laws and the Exchange Act is the appropriate place to clearly codify the authority that the Commission has to require disclosure of nominees running for board seats. Proxy access is fundamental to free and fair election for directors.
    Second, shareholders should have a right to ``say-on-pay,'' a vote on the appropriateness of CEO compensation. We are excited that we saw the vote in the House the other day, expect to see a full vote this week, and as Ann Yerger from CII said, we think it is absolutely essential that broker votes not be included in the total so that a change to 452, excluding broker votes on ``say-on-pay,'' would be a tremendous enhancement to see on the Senate side.
    I could make other comments, but let me wrap up by saying we thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify today. Rebuilding investor confidence in the market depends on thoughtful policymaking that expands investor rights and authorizes the SEC to strengthen its advocacy role on behalf of all Americans and their financial security.
    I would be happy to answer any questions.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Mr. Ferlauto.
    Let us do a 6-minute initial round with the intention of doing a second round so we can quickly get everyone to ask some questions. We are extremely fortunate your testimony collectively and individually has, I think, advanced this argument and debate significantly.
    Ms. Cross, one of the issues here that has been alluded to by Professor Verret and others is the interaction between the SEC and States, primarily Delaware, since they have 70 percent of the public corporations. Can you comment upon this? In fact, I think I noted in your proposed rules that they are subject to the State corporate law, is that correct?
    Ms. Cross. That is correct. Under the access proposal, you would have a right of access to include nominees in an SEC proxy--SEC-filed proxy only if you have a State law right to nominate directors. So we start with the State law and then we enable shareholders to exercise their State law rights through the Federal proxy rules.
"
Chairman Reed," That raises the issue, really, of since the proxy rules are Federal rules and not required by any States, I don't think, I think this is a principal sort of issue between whether or not there should be the ability of the SEC to require these rules even if the State doesn't. Is that something that you can't do now under present law or you choose not to do?
    Ms. Cross. That is a good question. Under State law now, recent changes in Delaware include an ability for shareholders to decide to vote to require the proxy access. We have authority under our current rules, under the 34 Act, to also require companies to include nominees in their proxy statement and we believe these do coexist. The way we have done our proposal assures that shareholders would have immediate access to the proxy to nominate their holders if they satisfy our requirements. They still could vote under State law to have--to relax the standard so that more shareholders can do so.
"
Chairman Reed," Professor Verret, I think you are interested in this topic. Your comments?
"
Mr. Verret," Mr. Chairman, I would only offer that the SEC's proposal does include references to State law, but specifically, the SEC's proposal says, sure, you can adopt a bylaw that would describe how proxy access will work only if it complies with the SEC's mandate. So it is very clear on that. It runs roughshod, I think, over State corporation law determining election rights, and so I think it expressly--you might find references in there to State law, but the references are intended to make clear that the SEC determines how proxy access is going to work and if there is any--you can certainly make up your own rules, only if they comply completely with the SEC's rules on this essentially State corporate law matter.
"
Chairman Reed," Well, there are State corporate laws, but I think you recognize that the proxy process is a result primarily of Federal laws.
"
Mr. Verret," Well, the proxy process, sure, and the proxy process was intended mostly about issues of disclosure. And I would offer a quote from Justice Powell in CPS v. Dynamics. You don't have to listen to me. Take Justice Powell's word for it. No principle of corporate law is more firmly established than a State's authority to regulate domestic corporations, including the voting rights of shareholders. So Justice Powell, at least, is with me on that one.
"
Chairman Reed," Do you agree with all of his opinions?
"
Mr. Verret," Well, no. No. I wouldn't say that.
    [Laughter.]
"
Mr. Verret," But I like that one.
"
Chairman Reed," Let me shift to Professor Coates and Mr. Castellani. You have described--in fact, you might comment on this issue, too, Professor Coates, and then I have another question.
"
Mr. Coates," I think it is, as I said in my opening remarks, I think that if Congress were not to act, the SEC were to adopt proxy access, it is almost certainly the case that someone will challenge their authority to do so precisely along the lines that Professor Verret has suggested. I think that challenge will lose because I think the proposal is about communication. It is allowing shareholders to exercise rights that they clearly do have under State law.
    The SEC's proposal would allow, contrary to what was suggested earlier, any State to change its law and make it clear that shareholders would not have the right to nominate directors in this fashion and then the SEC's rules would not override that State law decision. So the proposal, at least the way I read it and the way I believe that a court would read it, would not, in fact, conflict with State law on this issue.
"
Chairman Reed," Let me follow up on one of the comments you made in your statement, and that is that we assume, I think, that--at least there is a general assumption that shareholder participation the way we describe would enhance the performance of the company. But you suggest in certain situations, financial institutions, for example, that it could have perverse effects.
    It seems to me that there are three or four different decisions here. You can pay dividends. You can pay the executives instead of paying dividends. Or you can reinvest and increase shareholder value, et cetera. The shareholders, I think, would be interested in dividends and maybe also, second, long-term value, but less interested in compensation for executives. But that is just a sort of prelude to the question of what are the--what specific disincentives do you see if shareholders can vote like this?
"
Mr. Coates," I mean, there has been a longstanding economic theory about which there is a fair amount of evidence that suggests that in a company's capital structure, there are conflicts between the shareholders who are entitled to all upside beyond the fixed payments that creditors are entitled to and the creditors. The U.S. Government, because it insures the deposits of all the banks that it insures, which is most of them, is fundamentally a creditor of the large banking institutions, and so there is, in fact, going to be on many occasions a conflict of interest between shareholder interests and the interest of the taxpayer with respect to insured depository institutions. That is the fundamental conflict.
    And to the extent that the proposals go toward increasing shareholder power, that simply makes the bank regulators' jobs in restraining risk taking by those banks at the behest of shareholders and boards who are seeking to maximize share value, even if it is long-term share value, that much harder. So any effort in this area, I submit, should be accompanied by clear authority for the banking regulators to at least moderate the way these things play out for banking institutions.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you. My time has expired.
    Senator Bunning. And we will do a second round.
    Senator Bunning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Professor Verret, if we are going to make proxy access easier for shareholders, what restrictions would you recommend to make sure that the SS benefit a majority of shareholders and the long-term value of the company and does not just benefit small groups of investors and lead to short-term profits?
"
Mr. Verret," Well, Senator Bunning, I would offer that the best person to make--the best group to make that assessment is the shareholders themselves. And so I would leave it to shareholders to determine how proxy access should work, how it should operate.
    And so for that reason, I think the innovations at the level of Delaware and in the Model Business Code, which forms the basis for 20 to 30 other corporate law codes of other States, are on the right track. And I think also Commissioner Paredes has offered a proposal to the SEC to help buttress this development, to permit access for shareholder election bylaws to the corporate ballot.
    So in other words, instead of saying this is how the elections should work, we say shareholders can put forward a bylaw that should say how the election should work. All the shareholders should determine how that election should work. In many ways, it is similar to the Constitutional Convention. Rather than choosing--the people got to choose the mechanism by----
    Senator Bunning. You are not suggesting we go back to a Constitutional Convention----
"
Mr. Verret," No, no, but----
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Bunning. Not now.
"
Mr. Verret," But in effect, a ratification of a shareholder election bylaw is kind of like a Constitutional Convention for shareholders. I think that is an apt analogy.
    Senator Bunning. Professor Coates, in your written testimony--written--you raised an interesting idea. Rather than forcing a structure on all companies, you suggested an opt out vote by shareholders every few years for some governance proposals. That idea could be applied to proxy access and advisory vote procedures as well, instead of Government deciding what the rules will be.
    I want to know what each of you think of that approach, of a mandatory opt in or opt out vote every few years to decide certain matters. Let us start with you, Professor Coates. Since you seem to have expressed this idea, now I would like to hear your comments on it.
"
Mr. Coates," Sure. Thank you for the--obviously, I like my idea, but----
    Senator Bunning. Well, I hope so.
"
Mr. Coates," ----to explain, I don't think of it as necessary to prevent imposing Government regulation, because I don't think that is actually the intent of any of the proposals that are currently being debated. I do think it would be a good idea to preserve flexibility in what sorts of corporate governance structures companies are either required or induced to adopt, and one way to achieve that is to let shareholders, who, after all, this is meant to be in the interest of shareholders, so if shareholders every 5 years are given the option of rejecting a particular idea on the ground that it is too expensive, for example, too cumbersome, or simply inapt for their company, and here I would join Professor Verret in saying I think that is a reasonable approach.
    The key point, though, is it needs to be opt out, because as I alluded to in my opening remarks, shareholders on their own, despite the 20, 30 years of efforts by organizations like the one led by Ms. Yerger, have had a very hard time getting companies to be responsive. It has been 20 years since proxy access has been proposed by leading institutional shareholders and only now is it being taken seriously. So I have to, with all due respect, disagree with the Business Roundtable's suggestion that, in fact, corporate boards are generally responsive to shareholder desires. Start with a good rule----
    Senator Bunning. Ms. Cross.
"
Mr. Coates," Sorry.
    Ms. Cross. Thank you, sir. It is an interesting idea and I think with respect to our proxy access proposal, which is the one that we have on the table right now, we include requests for comment in our proposal about whether or not you should be able to opt out and have the shareholders choose a different access mechanism, and we very much look forward to receiving comments on that. This is a proposal as we----
    Senator Bunning. How much more time do we have?
    Ms. Cross. On the proposal?
    Senator Bunning. No, to make suggestions or to comment.
    Ms. Cross. The comment period runs through August 16 or 17, I believe.
    Senator Bunning. Thank you very much.
    Ms. Yerger.
    Ms. Yerger. I have a couple of observations. First of all, I am not a lawyer, so I come at this from a different perspective----
    Senator Bunning. Good. I am very happy to hear that.
    [Laughter.]
    Ms. Yerger. Our belief is that the board of directors is the cornerstone of the corporate governance model and the primary rights assigned to owners, aside from buying and selling their shares, is to elect and remove directors. And the fact is that we do not have those tools here in the United States. And that is why we advocate majority voting and access to the proxy. We think these are two principled rules. They are applicable to all companies at all times.
    In terms of an opt out idea, I mean, I don't see how an opt out would be relevant at all to majority voting for directors. I mean, I just believe fundamentally that if a director does not win support of a majority of the votes cast, that director should not stand----
    Senator Bunning. Thank you.
    Ms. Yerger. ----on the board. But one quick point on access. There is already a----
    Senator Bunning. I have only got 35 seconds, and I have got one more question.
    Ms. Yerger. OK, sorry.
    Senator Bunning. That is OK. This is for Professors Coates and Verret. Several weeks ago, Professor Henry Hu raised an interesting problem before this Subcommittee. He pointed out that with derivatives, the voting rights of shares can now be separated from the economic right of the shares, setting up a situation where the person voting has no interest in the long-term health of the company. What can and should be done about that? Take a shot at it, both of you.
"
Mr. Coates," I have a negative 5 seconds.
    Senator Bunning. Well, that is all right.
"
Mr. Coates," That is all right. OK.
    Senator Bunning. You get to answer.
"
Mr. Coates," Henry's issue is a serious one. It is one that has affected a number of companies in the past--in the recent years during the financial turmoil because it allows hedge funds' short-term speculators who have distinctly different interests than the long-term shareholders represented at this table----
    Senator Bunning. They can have a negative interest.
"
Mr. Coates," Exactly. Now, I believe that if the SEC is given time to address the issue adequately, they already understand that this is a significant problem. There are no simple fixes to this, just as there are no simple fixes to most problems in the market.
    Senator Bunning. You have not made a suggestion yet.
"
Mr. Coates," Well, disclosure is usually the place the SEC does and should start. That is the place where I would start on addressing the problem.
    Senator Bunning. Disclosure.
"
Mr. Coates," Yes, full disclosure of hedge fund positions.
"
Mr. Verret," I would echo that disclosure is--that sunlight is the best disinfectant and that the central mission of the SEC is disclosure. And, in fact, that is part of the reason why I am opposed to the SEC's current proposal on proxy access, and it is proxy access through legislation so that it goes beyond the central mission of the SEC for disclosure.
    Senator Bunning. Thank you.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you, Senator Bunning.
    Senator Schumer, please.
    Senator Schumer. Thank you. I thank all the witnesses. Very informative testimony. I am going to make two comments--one to Professor Verret, one to Professor Coates--to which you can comment in writing, because I do not have much time and I want to ask other questions.
    To Professor Verret, ``Let the shareholders decide,'' as Ms. Yerger points out, is a tautology. Shareholders do not decide now, so just saying let us leave it up to the shareholders and whatever they decide happens happens, in too many instances they just do not have the ability to decide now. Our rules are supposed to let them decide, and you are sort of proposal, well, whatever they say is what they want--not under these rules. You can respond in writing.
    [Ed. note: Answer not received by time of publication.]
    Senator Schumer. To Professor Coates, this idea that financial firms, because they could be bailed out, the shareholders would have a different structure, I would like you to ask the shareholders of Citigroup or AIG, former, if they feel that they have done quite well because they have let risks go too far and they were bailed out. In other words, most companies, by the time they are bailed out, their shares are worth very, very little. And I do not think they would have a different structure, and I would argue that the recent history would undercut your argument even further, and that is, allowing risk--because you are a financial firm and you might be bailed out allows you to take risk, and that is fine for the shareholders? They are going to be very wary of risk over the next 5 years, whether they are bailed out or not, because shares went way down.
    You can respond in writing to that one, but I just do not think the facts, the recent history bears out that hypothesis.
    Response: One of the most basic and widely accepted principles of corporate finance is that shareholders--who are entitled to all of the upside if a company does well--would rather that the company take more risks than do the creditors, who are generally entitled only to receive back the principal and preset interest on their loans. See R.A. Brealey and S.C. Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance (5th ed. 1996) at 492 (``stockholders of . . . firms [with debt] gain when business risk increases. Financial managers who act strictly in their shareholders' interests (and against the interests of creditors) will favor risky projects over safe ones. They may even take risky projects with negative [net present expected value]''). Nothing in the recent crisis has affected that general conclusion. Higher risk generally means higher return for shareholders, but for creditors, whose return is fixed, risk-taking by corporate borrowers just increases the odds that they will not get repaid in full.
    Generally, creditors protect themselves against shareholders pressuring companies to take too much risk by negotiating for explicit restrictions in their contracts. For example, a bank loan may forbid a company from reducing its cash on hand below a set level, or from making large new investments without creditor approval. The U.S. Government, as back-stop creditor of all of the major commercial banks (and, as it turned out, AIG, too, even though AIG was not an insured bank), tries to protect itself against excessive risk-taking by setting capital requirements and imposing other forms of regulation on banks. Existing regulations have not proven effective, and many proposals under consideration would strengthen those regulations, and limit further the risks that banks may take with taxpayer funds. Strengthening the hand of shareholders of major banks may undercut those efforts.
    You are right that not all risks turn out to be good ones for shareholders, and that there are risks that turn out badly for shareholders as well as creditors, as has been the case in the recent crisis. But when the managers of large financial institutions are making decisions, they do not know how the risks will play out. Imagine a manager can choose between two investments, each to be financed partly with $5 of shareholder money and partly with a $5 loan from the creditor. One investment will pay off $5 100 percent of the time--it has no ``risk'', but it also promises no return to the shareholders, since the whole return will go to creditors. The second investment will pay off $10 90 percent of the time, and will generate a loss of $100 10 percent of the time. The second investment is clearly better for shareholders, since (in expectation) it is worth $5 90 percent of the time ($10 less the $5 loan), and -$5 10 percent of the time (loss of their $5 investment). But the second investment involves a risk to the creditors (e.g., the U.S. taxpayers) since it involves a potential loss and an inability by the company to pay back the loan, and is worse for society as a whole. Suppose the managers nevertheless choose the second investment, and it pays off badly--i.e., it generates a loss. With hindsight, shareholders have lost, too, along with the creditors. But that doesn't mean that the investment was bad for the shareholders. It is only after the loss has appeared that the investment looks bad. If they had to do all over again, most diversified shareholders generally would have the managers choose the second investment. This example is stylized, but it is no different in kind than the investment decisions that financial institution managers make every day.
    Corporate governance rules are changed rarely--you will be writing legislation not for the next 5 years, but for decades, through recessions and boom markets alike, and will apply to a range of publicly held companies. If the managers are forced by strong corporate governance reforms to follow more closely the directions of shareholders, they will tend, on average, to take more risks than they would if shareholder power were weaker. For most companies, creditors can take care of themselves, through contract, and in principle, as the bank regulators can offset any general increase in risk-taking by managers caused by shareholders, by requiring higher capital ratios or imposing more restrictive regulations. But the tendency of bank regulators has been, unfortunately, to fail to impose strict enough regulations to cope with the pressure of incentive compensation and other techniques for tying managers' interests to shareholder goals. General corporate governance changes of the kind being discussed should be written with that unfortunate fact in mind.
    Senator Schumer. Ms. Cross, the SEC has proposed ``say-on-pay'' for TARP recipients but not for other public companies. If ``say-on-pay'' is a good idea when the Government is a shareholder, why isn't it a good idea for all shareholders?
    Ms. Cross. Chairman Schapiro has indicated that she supports ``say-on-pay'' for all public companies, and we do not have authority to require ``say-on-pay'' at public companies beyond the TARP companies.
    Senator Schumer. But you would be supportive of it.
    Ms. Cross. I cannot speak for the Commission, and the Commission has not taken a position.
    Senator Schumer. OK. But Chairman Schapiro is supportive of it.
    Ms. Cross. Chairman Schapiro has said she supports it, and we stand ready to implement it if Congress enacts it.
    Senator Schumer. OK, good.
    Mr. Castellani, you note that some of the proposals--and I think that is significant, and I appreciate that. You note that some of the proposals in the Shareholder Bill of Rights are already being adopted by your member companies and reflect an emerging consensus on best practices in corporate governance. Well, if that is the case, then what are you so afraid of? If this is the trend anyway, if you seem to indicate this is the right thing to do, what is wrong with pushing those--you know, I had a discussion with one of your members, and I will not reveal who it is, but he said, ``Look, I am not''--and then he named his predecessor. ``You do not have to legislate for me.'' I said, ``That is my whole point. We are not legislating for you. You are a good CEO, and whether your shareholders made you be a good CEO or not, you would be. But what about your predecessor?''
    So, question: Doesn't the Shareholder Bill of Rights create a competitive advantage for the companies that follow the best practices? And why does the Roundtable, most of whom comply, I think overwhelmingly, with some of our proposals, and many comply with just about all of our proposals, why are they going so far to defend the outlier companies for whom the laws are needed most?
"
Mr. Castellani," Senator, in fact, many of the Roundtable companies do and have adopted many of the practices that are in your proposal. The difference--
    Senator Schumer. And you cite that with pride.
"
Mr. Castellani," Yes, absolutely. The difference is those----
    Senator Schumer. That is not a very good argument against my proposal.
"
Mr. Castellani," Well, those who have not have made--those who have and those who have not have made the determination that that is best for their company. Their directors have made that determination, that that is best for their company under their circumstances.
    For example, the issue that you cited in the separation of the chairman and the chief executive officer, in some instances it makes very good sense to separate the chairman and chief executive officer, particularly where it is a transition event. But in other circumstances, boards feel that it makes best sense to have both together, but protect against the downside by having a presiding director or----
    Senator Schumer. As I mentioned--and I am----
"
Mr. Castellani," So the question is: Why require it?
    Senator Schumer. I do not have much time, and I cannot stay for a second round. I am going to have to ask you another question. I understand. I mean, the one, as I said, that got the most kickback and that I am open to listening to change on or proposals on is the CEO and the independent director. You noted that 75 percent of your member organizations, 70 percent of S&P 500 companies, have adopted majority voting, and roughly half of the S&P 500s now hold annual director elections. Yet you argue that the one-size-fits-all approach simply will not work.
    Can you give me one good reason that a director who gets only one vote at an annual meeting should be allowed to continue as a director?
"
Mr. Castellani," I cannot give you any good reason why any director who does not receive a majority vote of the shareholders should be seated, unless--unless--it jeopardizes the ability of that company to be able to operate and that board to operate.
    For example, many companies who have adopted majority voting put in a safeguard for their companies such that if they require that particular director--that may be the only director that has the financial expertise that is required on the audit committee, the only director that would have the compensation expertise that is required on the compensation committee. If that would force the company to be in noncompliance, then what companies do is----
    Senator Schumer. How about take away that exception? Any other justification? Let us assume we wrote into the law----
"
Mr. Castellani," Not as long as the board can function and the company can function.
    Senator Schumer. OK, thanks. Well, good, we have won you over on at least two-thirds of one of our proposals.
"
Mr. Verret," And, legally, Senator, I would offer that failure to seat a quorum could result in a wide variety of legal circumstances, including, for instance, it could be an event of default under the company's debt obligation.
    Senator Schumer. I am sure we could deal with that, particularly with the quorum issue, in the interim until there was another election.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you, Senator Schumer.
    Senator Corker, please.
    Senator Corker. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the Senator from New York, I appreciate you offering something to look at.
    I do want to observe the staggered board issue I think has not been universally accepted, and I think we have a body on the other side of the Capitol that does not have staggered boards, and sometimes things come out of there pretty hot, like the 90-percent tax on the AIG bonuses. So I think there is some merit in that and hope you might consider that particular piece evolving. But I want to say one other thing.
    Professor Coates, I know that to assume that the folks who own AIG today are the same folks who might have encouraged the risk would not be a good assumption. I mean, those guys sold out high, and the folks that are left behind--so, again, I do not think you can make that assessment. So I hope we can look at some of those things, and I look forward to really trying to work with you on something that we both might consider to be improved.
    We talked to Carl Icahn on the phone some time ago--I shared this with Senator Schumer--and he is obviously someone who cares a great deal about corporate governance. He has written about this, or I would not relay our conversation. It is certainly something he publicly feels. But the whole issue of where companies are incorporated seems to be an issue that is maybe even bigger than anything that has been laid out today. And I wonder if a couple of you might respond to that.
    Obviously, companies incorporate in States in many cases that give them many protections and keep shareholders from being able to make huge changes. And I wonder, Professor Coates and Professor Verret, if you might both respond to that, and anybody else who might have something salient.
"
Mr. Verret," Well, I am aware that Mr. Icahn has funded North Dakota's Business Incorporation Act. He hired a lawyer to write it for him, and he hopes to get companies to reincorporate to North Dakota.
    Having clerked for the Delaware Court of Chancery, I am a bit biased. I think Delaware is a very effective court for litigating corporate governance issues--mostly due to the intelligence and superior talent of their law clerks. But I would also offer that, to some extent, I think some of what is behind some of this effort is short-termism, some of the short-termism that got us into this problem in the first place: Let us cash out on dividends rather than invest in R&D.
    And sometimes hedge fund activism is very effective in long-term growth and in sort of rattling the saber a little bit and getting things moving. And sometimes hedge fund activism, though, kills companies that should continue to survive and strips them of their assets. And so I think that is part of what is behind the approach.
    Also, I think we----
    Senator Corker. In essence, then, you are saying that you like some activism on behalf of shareholders, but not too much.
"
Mr. Verret," Absolutely, and I am a little bit suspicious of Mr. Icahn's motives, at some of his activism in activism in favor of State incorporation.
    Senator Corker. Thank you.
"
Mr. Coates,"
"
Mr. Coates," So it has been true for a long time that shareholders cannot force a reincorporation from one State to another on their own. They need the board to go along with it. And the board cannot do it on their own; it has got to be a joint decision. And as a result, there is actually relatively little movement between States once they have chosen their initial State of incorporation.
    At the moment before they go public, that is really the crucial decision point, and for that reason I think that fact that Delaware has a 70-percent share of the market, so to speak, it reflects well on Delaware. I think it is actually a reasonably healthy sign that Delaware is being responsive, as best it can, to balancing the interests of both shareholders and the managers that have to run them.
    One thing, however, I would note about Delaware and its permissiveness toward a little bit of activism is it only passed that enabling legislation in the past year, and it did it in response to the threat of Federal intervention coming from this body. And so I do not think you should think about Delaware acting on its own to help shareholders. I think you should think about Delaware acting in relationship to this body, and things that you do are going to very much impact it.
    Senator Corker. Mr. Castellani, I have served on several public company boards, certainly not of the size of AIG or some of the other companies we have had troubles with. But I do not think there is any question that boards in many cases--not all, and yours, I am sure, is not this way. But it ends up being sort of a social thing. I mean, you are on the board because the CEO of this company and the CEO of that company is on the board, and, you know, it is sort of a status thing in many cases. The CEO in many cases helps select who those board members are. And most of the time these board--many of the times, these board members have their own fish to fry. They have companies that they run, they are busy with, and, for instance, a complex financial institution, there is no way, like no possible way that most board members of these institutions really understand some of the risks that are taking place. With the limited number of board meetings, even if they are on the audit committee, very difficult to do.
    So some of these things need to be addressed certainly by governance issues that we might address here, hopefully not too many. Some of them need to be addressed, obviously, internally at the companies. I know you have advocated that in the office. But that issue of sort of the culture of the way boards in many cases are. Not in every case. I wonder if you might have a comment there, and then add to that--I am familiar with a company that makes investments in large companies, and one of the rules they have is they do not allow the CEO himself to actually serve on the board. They report to the board. They are at the meeting. But they do not allow them to serve on the board. So I would love for you to respond to both of those inquiries.
"
Mr. Castellani," I think, Senator, for your first question, what you are reflecting may have been the experience when you served on the boards. But what I think it does not reflect is the tremendous change that has occurred in the boardrooms over the last 8 years.
    We now see boards of directors, in the case of Business Roundtable companies, that are at least 80 percent independent, and that is, the directors are independent of the company management.
    Indeed, the governance committees or the nominating committees that nominate the directors by requirement of the listing standards and the SEC are made up entirely of independent directors. So the nomination of a board member, a prospective board member, is no longer--if it indeed every was--controlled by the chief executive officer.
    And then, third, I would point out particularly the amount of time that is involved and the amount of expertise that is involved. It is not only the specific requirement of the expertise that is in the listing standards and the SEC requirements, but indeed what boards themselves are demanding and what companies and their shareholders are demanding has resulted in not only greater expertise in specific areas, but a tremendous increase in the amount of time.
    For example, I was recently talking to the chair of the audit committee of a large U.S. company. That chair spent 800 hours of, in this case, his time as the chair of an audit committee over the last year because of some very complex financial issues. So the board members are spending more and more time. So I would submit to you, sir, that it is very different than when you served on the boards.
    And in terms of the boards being able to have the CEO as a member of the board, the CEO as a member of a board, in fact, the CEO and chairman where companies choose it, is a very, very important nexus between the governance of a corporation and the management of a corporation.
    We have found and experience has shown over a long period of time that if you separate the governance from the management, you get precisely the kinds of problems that this Committee is trying to avoid. So having the CEO on the board is a very, very important nexus. In many cases, companies and boards believe that having the CEO as chairman of the board is also very important.
    Again, my point would be what I have said in my testimony: That is up to every company to decide, and their board of directors representing the shareholders to decide, rather than be prescriptive, because it is not always right, but it is always right for the company that makes the right decision, and they should be allowed to make that decision.
    Senator Corker. Thank you.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much, Senator Corker.
    Senator Menendez, please.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony.
    Let me ask you, I understand that in a previous question, most of you--I understand just one or two objections, but most of you said that you support the SEC's May 20th rule to allow certain shareholders to include their nominees and proxies that are sent to all the other shareholders. Do you think that goes far enough? Or is to too far? If you support it, I assume that it goes far enough, it is sufficient. But is there something that should be done than that? Does that embody what we want to see?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Senator Mendendez, I think it is an appropriate use of rule making, which is purely disclosure-based, which is very important; that is that it leaves up to the States the creation of rights in terms of the nomination of directors, but it empowers shareholders to be informed through shareholder communications about the fact that those elections are indeed occurring, and then votes through the proxy materials on that right. So I think that is a good balance.
    In addition, something that we have not talked about, the rule goes further, and it empowers shareholders to make binding bylaw amendments to improve those shareholder rights for the election of directors so that this disclosure right at 1 percent--or actually it is a tiered system that they have in the disclosure rule right now for comment--becomes a floor of disclosure, and then at the State level, through an election system based on a shareholder proposal or a board proposal, they can increase or tweak that right in an interesting way.
    For example, I talked about ShareOwners.org being interested in retail shareholders. They can never hope to get 1 percent. But as in the U.K., you might be able to get 100 shareholders, retail shareholders, each owning $5,000 or $10,000 worth together who might be an appropriate group to create different types of rights.
    So that there is flexibility, which I think is quite welcome.
"
Mr. Verret," Senator Menendez, I would offer that Commissioner Paredes of the SEC has offered a competing proposal to the Chairman's proposal, and I think Commissioner Paredes' proposal is much more reasonable in that it considers facilitation of State law rights rather than running roughshod over them and sort of keeping the lion's share of the meat and leaving the table scraps for the States. And I think Commissioner Paredes' proposal also strikes a balance in limiting the ability of special interests to hijack the corporate ballot. And so I would offer that for this Committee's attention.
    Senator Menendez. Does anyone else have any opinion on it?
"
Mr. Castellani," Yes, Senator, I was not one of the majority who supported that, and I just wanted to make sure that you knew that.
    Our concern is that what the SEC is proposing to give access to the shareholders does preempt what has been traditionally done in the States. And, quite frankly, we think that there is symmetry in the argument that says if we trust the shareholders to elect the boards of directors, which we do implicitly, then we ought to trust the shareholders to set the threshold at which shareholders can nominate those board of directors candidates.
    Ms. Yerger. I would just note that, as I said earlier, we think this is a core right that should be federalized. The States have failed investors too long, Delaware in particular, and it really only acted when it had to. And I think it is important that the SEC take action on this important reform.
    Senator Menendez. Let me ask in a different context. In practice, a corporation serves multiple masters, right? It has shareholders, it has corporate management, its creditors, the public in general. There are many cases where what is best for corporate management may not necessarily be the best for shareholders. Or there are also cases where what is best for shareholders is not what is best for the general public or the financial institution as a whole.
    How do we reconcile those tensions?
"
Mr. Castellani," That is a very interesting question that has been discussed--I am the oldest on the panel, so I can say this--for at least most of my corporate career.
    Senator Menendez. There is no one seeking to claim objection, I notice.
    [Laughter.]
"
Mr. Castellani," I am used to it.
    Senator Menendez. You have created compromise already.
"
Mr. Castellani," There was particularly a very important topic in the 1980s, particularly when there was as lot of activity related to hostile takeovers, and that is, to whom is a board of directors and a management responsible? And the argument was a stakeholder argument, that there were shareholders, there were employees, there were communities, there were suppliers, there were customers, all of which had a legitimate position in the decisions.
    I would think it is fair to say that in the 1990s and the early part of this decade, that balance switched more to the shareholders, but what happened is the nature of the shareholders has changed very, very considerably. And that is, the average holding period, for example, of a New York Stock Exchange-listed company is about 7\1/2\ months. So if your management and your board--you are really dealing with share renters and traders as much, if not more, than shareholders. And I think what we are all discussing here and we all have a perspective on is: Going forward, what is the correct balance between those who have a very, very short-term interest in very quick gain out of a company and may want to do some of the things that have been discussed here? You give access, you give rights to small percentages of shareholders. We already know in many cases how they act. Some funds come in and say, ``We own 5 percent of your company. What we want you to do is leverage the company, buy back the shares, give us about a 10-or 20-percent jump, and we are out of here, quickly.'' As opposed to other shareholders who say, ``I think there is a value-added.''
    I do not know that anybody is in the long term. I do not know that any of us know the right answer to that. But I think, quite frankly, that is the question that is at the crux of what this Committee should be looking at. Obviously----
"
Mr. Ferlauto," And, Senator, I--interestingly enough for here, this is where the Business Roundtable and certainly AFSCME, and I think some members of CII agree. It is all about how you empower long-termism and long-term shareholders, which we believe that proxy access ultimately will do, so that the best interests of the company to achieve long-term shareholder value is achieved. And the way you do that, actually, in terms of this long-termism, is getting into the DNA of the board. How does the board become most effective by being diverse, by being able to absorb many different points of view, by being--to evaluate itself to make sure that it is focused on long-term strategic implementation and that CEO pay incentives are aligned with that long strategic vision? And when we see a company that fails, we see a failure in all of those areas, which is bad for the shareholders, which is bad for the employees, which is bad for management, and for all other stakeholders in the process.
    So we want proxy access to fix boards because they cannot self-evaluate, because they are not diverse enough to share the interests of their stakeholders, which ultimately they need in order to achieve long-term shareholder value, and because their DNA is warped enough that it only serves management or a minority of shareholders and not achieve value for the long term. And that is the very essence of why we want proxy access and we need it now.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you.
"
Mr. Verret," Senator, may I just also add quickly, I want to commend Senator Warner and Senator Corker for the introduction of the TARP Recipient Ownership Trust Act. Shareholders and boards are complicated enough. When Government becomes a shareholder, things become even more tricky, and I want to commend the introduction of that act as dealing with some--going down the road to dealing with those unique conflicts.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Menendez.
    Senator Johanns.
    Senator Johanns. Mr. Chairman, thank you. To all the panel members, thank you very much for being here.
    What I am trying to figure out as I listened to this very interesting dialogue between the Senators and each of you, is this: I kind of look at this as maybe a little bit black and white. There are big players here, and there are small players here. But they are all affected by the decisions we make here.
    Now, Mr. Ferlauto, if I could start with you, how much money do you have under investment, say at this point in time?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," AFSCME itself is a rather small player. Our employee pension system itself has got less than $1 billion in it. But most importantly is that we are concerned about the retirement security of our members, and our members depend on well-functioning capital markets and boards to achieve value. In order for them to pay the benefits, all of our members want a market that will succeed, that has got the ability to achieve a value over time. We are not speaking and we are not active on the part necessarily of what is in our portfolio, but what is in the interests of not only our members, but all American families seeking to achieve long-term financial security. And those are the people that I speak on behalf of.
    Senator Johanns. Great. Well, I have never had $1 billion under management, so I see you as a big player. What if some institution out there who has $1 billion under investment or $10 billion, or whatever--let us say they are a big player, like I think you are. Let us say you decide that you think the worst possible course of action for a company is to be pro-trade, and there are some that very openly espouse that theory, that trade has really cost jobs and hurt America and this and that.
    If you have access to the proxy, you then have the right to elect somebody who espouses that view. Would that be correct?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," No, not necessarily. What we have the right to do is to potentially nominate somebody, but in order for somebody to be elected, they would have to be elected by a majority of everybody who is voting, and then presumably all the owners, as in a regular election, would assert their choices based on what is in their self-interests. So that I would assume that a minority player working on any--you know, any motivated self-interest would not be able to achieve victory.
    Senator Johanns. Here is what I am trying to get to, and I am not trying to be coy about this. I am trying to be very, very direct about this. I have got 100 shares; you have got $1 billion worth of shares. I am pro-trade, let us say, and whoever this institution is--I am not say AFSCME is this, but whoever this institution is, it takes a very, very different view than I do that may not be in the best interest.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," It is actually a very good point, but who I am concerned about are actually the large financial intermediaries, particularly mutual funds, who are seeking to do business, you know, with other large companies to sell their investment products through their 401(k) plans so that they actually may cast their votes in a way that would be looked kindly on by the CEO because they are not voting against his compensation plan, rather than voting in the interests of all the small individual investors who put their money into that fund, you know, thinking that that is the way to achieve value. And those are the kinds of conflicts that are rife in this system that we are very concerned about.
    Senator Johanns. Yes, and I am going to be very direct again. You and I are going to have an easy time agreeing that there are a lot of ways to be self-interested. A lot of ways. So, Mr. Castellani, let me turn to you. Based on your corporate experience, what impact does that have on your company if there is, for lack of better terminology, ease of entry here?
"
Mr. Castellani," One of the things that we are concerned about is that it would politicize the board. The board is legally required to represent all shareholders. So each member of the board is to represent all shareholders, not a particularly constituency of shareholders. But, in fact, there are constituencies of shareholders, people who want short-term gains, people who want--you were giving an example, my company, Tenneco, owned Newport News Shipbuilding. We had a shareholder, a nice little group from Connecticut, a group of nuns who owned $2,600 of the company and wanted us to get out of the nuclear shipbuilding business. And every year, they would have that on the proxy.
    The point is that dissension first costs the shareholders money, because that is who pays for the proxy process. It doesn't come out of the management's pocket. It doesn't come out of the Government's pocket. The shareholders pay for the dissension.
    But second--directly, they pay for the proxy process--but second, boards best operate when they operate by consensus, when there is an agreement among the board of the strategic direction of the company and who should implement that strategic direction. It doesn't mean there isn't discussion. It doesn't mean there isn't questioning, that there isn't dissension. But when they make a decision, companies operate best when you don't second-guess, until there is reason to second-guess, the direction the company is going.
    Senator Johnson. I am out of time, and I won't press that too much today because we have been given extra time today, but I want to offer one other thought on a totally different approach. I was on a panel yesterday in this room, and as I started my questioning, I said to the panelists, I said, I am going to warn you. I am a former Governor. It just astounds me how we have this philosophy here--and I am very new to this Senate job--it just astounds me how we think all of the best solutions are here in Washington with a Federal approach. This really does impact States in a very, very significant way. That in itself is a very, very profound issue. And yet we just kind of jump right in the middle of it with this new approach that just casts aside 50 State corporate laws.
    And I will share this with you. When I started as Governor many years ago, I decided that I wanted to be a State that attracted business to my State. We needed jobs and we needed economic growth in the State of Nebraska and I decided I was going to take on Delaware to try to make that happen. You know what I realized about Delaware? They had one heck of a good start and they were doing more things right than they were doing wrong and it was going to be very, very difficult to dent that.
    And yet in this hearing, again, whether it is Delaware or Nebraska or Wyoming or California, whoever, we have a very, very profound impact on the history of corporate governance in this Nation and I just don't think we should do that lightly. I think you would have 50 Governors in those seats back there ready to come to the table to chew on us about that, because it does have very significant consequences for the States where the jobs do exist, where the jobs are created, where hopefully the businesses grow and expand and create economic opportunities for the people out there who then pay the taxes that allow us to come here and do the social and other programs that we just love to do.
    So I just think it is really an important philosophical issue and that is my little sermonette at the end of the questioning. Thank you.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you, Senator Johanns.
    Let us begin the second round.
    Ms. Yerger, what is the status of majority voting on Delaware law now? Is it----
    Ms. Yerger. Under Delaware, and again, I am not a lawyer, it is not the default standard, but the laws do accommodate majority voting so companies can adopt it voluntarily.
"
Chairman Reed," They can adopt it voluntarily. But under the--and Ms. Cross, under the SEC's proposal, that would not upset Delaware law if you were talking about majority voting. It would be optional.
    Ms. Cross. We don't have a proposal on majority voting. The way it would work with our proxy access is that if there were more people running than there were slots, you would usually revert to plurality voting because majority wouldn't work.
"
Chairman Reed," OK. Thank you.
    Mr. Castellani, again, thank you for being here and for your testimony. I think the core of the issue is who knows best about the company, the directors or the shareholders. Under the present arrangement, and we have got enough lawyers who can criticize my legal analysis, is that the directors essentially control access in most companies to the proxy unless you want to mount a very expensive proxy fight. They decide in most cases and in most companies what will get on as an issue and what won't get on as an issue. So the current practice, unless we do something, will leave sort of the directors with critical control of the process and then on both sides of this argument we are talking about empowering shareholders. So your comments, and then I will open it up to the panel.
"
Mr. Castellani," Sure. First, for the record, let me state I am a scientist and engineer, not a lawyer.
"
Chairman Reed," Well, Senator Bunning, again, thank you on his behalf.
"
Mr. Castellani," I want to say that as often as I can.
    In fact, the directors do not control access to the proxy for all issues. In fact, the SEC controls. Therefore, companies like Tenneco get proposals. All companies get proposals related to social issues, governance issues, economic issues, labor issues, environmental issues. But I don't think that is what you are talking about.
    What you are talking about is the access for the purposes of nominating directors and we have to talk about that in the context of any group of shareholders, any single shareholder has an ability, if they can afford it, and it is an expensive proposition----
"
Chairman Reed," Yes.
"
Mr. Castellani," ----to nominate directors and run in competition to the directors that are nominated by the Nominating Committee. That is how we do takeovers and that is how the companies make sea changes, or investors make sea changes.
    What I am concerned about and what we are concerned about is we have, by majority vote, by and large, directors who are elected to represent all shareholders. Those directors are, by and large, elected every year. And so if the shareholders elect the directors and the shareholders can remove the directors under majority voting, then how does the company best operate on behalf of the shareholders?
    Is it best operated in letting those directors make, in their collective judgment, decisions about who should be on the board representing the shareholders, who should manage the company, or do we subject those directors or a portion of them--a significant portion, 25 percent of them--to a reelection challenge every year and turn them into essentially corporate politicians, because these are contested elections. They are somehow going to have to be run as contested elections.
    And what does that do to the director? Does that then distract her from the business that we all want her to do, which is overseeing the shareholders' interests in that board room, or does she have to be more concerned because the conflicting nominee was elected because they didn't want us to be in the nuclear shipbuilding business, in my case, or they didn't want us to do business in a particular part of the world, or they wanted our product lines to change, or they wanted some practices to change.
    What our concern is is that boards should be free to do and responsible for doing what the shareholders want them to do, and that is be good stewards of their investment in the company.
"
Chairman Reed," Well, my sense is--and you are right to narrow down my focus to the directors' election because social issues, they do get on the board because the SEC has required that and there is an argument they could require the directors also to be subject to proxy access.
    But the other side of the argument is there is a group of directors that essentially nominates the Nominating Committee. Usually the Nominating Committee is directors----
"
Mr. Castellani," Right.
"
Chairman Reed," ----who then choose other people they think are sympathetic to them and their views and the shareholders, unless they are not in a proxy fight, generally they either have to accept this board, and many times, as you pointed out, the board is not elected by a majority. In fact, there are many times where less than a majority of shareholders, a small number of shareholders even vote, and I think there has been a lot of discussion back and forth about motivation for voting, but most shareholders don't know--it is not the politics as practiced elsewhere. Most shareholders are reflecting on their dividends, their share value, what they think the company should be doing economically for their benefit. It is quite self-interested.
"
Mr. Castellani," I think, Senator, another point I should make--two other points I should make is that good boards, and certainly I would include our companies, have means by which they communicate and allow shareholders to suggest directors. And in fact, that is something that all of our member companies do now.
    So small groups of shareholders--and let us not kid ourselves. I mean, any management, any board that is worth anything, that can wake up and make their own breakfast in the morning, when a large shareholder comes in and says, we want to talk to you about the make-up of the board, by God, we listen, because you forget, we are in the business of trying to sell our shares to members and convince investors that we are a good company to invest in. So we listen to investors.
    The problem that we have is that sometimes in these discussions, you are talking about individual investors and we have to be responsive to our largest investors, which are institutional investors. And so the desires of individuals come through intermediaries, the mutual fund and the fund managers, and that message is very different than what some of the things that you are describing.
"
Chairman Reed," This is a conversation that could go on at length, but I am going to stop and recognize Senator Bunning. Thank you.
    Senator Bunning. Thank you very much.
    Professor Verret, there has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages but little discussion on the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should we vote on and how often should we vote?
"
Mr. Verret," Well, notably, I think one thing I would draw out is that there is a big difference between ``say-on-pay'' and say on severance packages. I think those are two distinct issues. There is a healthy debate about both of them, but I think it is a mistake to lump them in together. I think the big difference between say on severance is that severance packages are used to facilitate efficient mergers and acquisitions. Basically, sometimes when a good M&A deal goes through, the CEO of the target has to go. It is, you have got to leave and here is some walking-away money. And those deals are great, and most of the----
    Senator Bunning. But that isn't my question.
"
Mr. Verret," OK. So my first answer is, I would differentiate ``say-on-pay'' and say on severance.
    With respect to ``say-on-pay,'' I think one of the details is how often would you approve ``say-on-pay,'' and I am aware that the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, at least, wants it every 3 years. I think some groups prefer it every----
    Senator Bunning. Every 3 years?
"
Mr. Verret," Yes. They would prefer the pay package----
    Senator Bunning. By the time the second year came around, maybe the company would be in Chapter 11.
"
Mr. Verret," Well, perhaps, but what they propose is that typically, pay packages are negotiated over longer terms, so ``say-on-pay'' should be negotiated over the longer term. You don't necessarily reapprove the pay package every year. Sometimes they are longer term. Sometimes they are 5 or 10 years.
    So one of the things I would suggest is that you leave open the boards of directors and the shareholders to determine how they want ``say-on-pay'' to work.
    Senator Bunning. Then you think they should be left open to the boards in negotiating with whoever they want as their CEO?
"
Mr. Verret," I worry about the effects of one-size-fits-all packages, and I think we have seen that effect in Britain with their ``say-on-pay'' rules.
    Senator Bunning. And you think the negotiations on golden parachutes should be different completely?
"
Mr. Verret," They should be, because sometimes you have to do them very quickly, not enough time to get approval for the package to deal with the specific merger.
    Senator Bunning. Would you like to comment?
"
Mr. Coates," Very briefly. ``Say-on-pay'' is advisory votes only. There is no need for speed. There is no need for prior voting. The U.K., the Netherlands, Australia have successfully implemented this for years, and in fact, the evidence from the U.K. suggests that it almost never has a bad effect on companies, that almost all of the time, shareholders approve the pay package as presented. There are a few outliers that get their pay packages voted down and the result of that has been a better alignment of shareholder and manager interests over the past 5 years in the United Kingdom. So I think the U.K. model is working and I think it is a reasonable place to start.
"
Mr. Verret," Although as I am sure Professor Coates might be aware, the shareholder electorate in the United Kingdom is very different from the United States--
    Senator Bunning. No. This is not a discussion between--we have to ask the questions.
"
Mr. Verret," Sorry. He is my old professor and he gave me a ``B'' in corporate law, so I have to----
    Senator Bunning. A ``B''? That is pretty good.
    [Laughter.]
    Senator Bunning. Unbelievable. I will give you a chance to talk again.
    As States respond to concerns about corporate governance issues with changes to their own laws, is there really a need to federalize business law?
"
Mr. Verret," Well, I would agree, and I think we haven't even had time to see the effect of the State changes on proxy access operate after Delaware and the other States facilitated majority voting in 2006. From 2006 to 2007, we saw an increase in majority voting at companies from 20 percent of the S&P 500 to 50 percent. So Delaware just amended its code in, I think, March, and the ABA is about to change the Model Business Code. So there hasn't been enough time to see, I think, all the proxy access bylaws that I think we are going to see adopted by boards.
    Senator Bunning. Ann, would you like to comment?
    Ms. Yerger. I firmly believe that the problem here are the problem companies and----
    Senator Bunning. Yes, we know about them.
    Ms. Yerger. ----and that is why I believe these issues should be federalized, frankly.
    Senator Bunning. Yes, but they are at the trough every time they have a problem, whether they are a finance company or whether they are an insurance company, whether they are an auto company. If you think they are too big to fail, then the Federal Government is the backstop. And if they are a GSE, we are the backstop for sure. So do you have some other suggestions that we might not have to be the backstop?
    Ms. Yerger. Suggestions regarding specifically--I am sorry. I have lost the question here.
    Senator Bunning. You lost the question. Well, about the laws being changed in the States on corporate governance.
    Ms. Yerger. I feel that majority voting, we have had plenty of experience and the fact is that there are many companies--in fact, most small companies have not adopted it. We think it is a core owner right and as a result it should be federalized.
    I also believe that proxy access should be federalized. The fact is, when council members invest in domestic companies, they are not doing a portfolio of Delaware companies or Nebraska companies. They are doing a portfolio of the U.S. companies, and we either make a decision that these are basic rights we should be offering to owners of any company here in the United States or not. And I think the Council firmly believes that----
    Senator Bunning. The fact that if I live in Kentucky, where I live, you want me to come in and say, the Federal Government should make the rules for every company in Kentucky.
    Ms. Yerger. Regarding access on majority voting----
    Senator Bunning. Yes.
    Ms. Yerger. ----yes, sir.
    Senator Bunning. You do.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," If I may, another----
    Senator Bunning. It won't sell.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Another approach to this which I think might sell is that give shareholders the power to decide what State they will incorporate in, and therefore you can----
    Senator Bunning. Well, they do have the power.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," No, they don't, actually, is that right now, it is the boards through the IPO----
    Senator Bunning. Oh, you mean beforehand, before they incorporate.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Maybe every 5 years. You talked about one way to do this is to give them a right every four or 5 years, similar to Mr. Coates's idea, that rather than opting in and opting out of a variety of laws, they actually have a right to decide on whether the charter and powers of a particular State are appropriate for them at a particular moment and allow shareholders to decide on their own----
    Senator Bunning. You, as a billion-dollar investor, you as a person who controls $1 billion worth of investment, would say that to the shareholders after the fact, after they have already incorporated?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," I agree that there should be more--that the State of incorporation should be a greater factor when IPOs are made and that there is not enough emphasis or focus on corporate governance during the IPO process, and I think that would be something very interesting for the SEC to look at for perhaps new rule making. But if you are talking about empowering the States, one thing that you might consider to do is to give them real power and create real competition among Delaware and Nebraska and North Dakota and California and every other State by making State corporation real and let them compete. The only way you can let them compete is by giving shareholders, the owners of these companies, real power to make a decision about what laws are most appropriate to them.
    Senator Bunning. It won't sell.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," It is a market-based----
    Senator Bunning. It won't sell. We can't sell it, because we would have 50 Governors up here every day trying to tell us to mind our own business.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Yes, but----
    Senator Bunning. Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Reed," Senator Corker.
    Senator Corker. Thank you all for your testimony, and again, both of you, for having the hearing.
    I think what--well, based on backgrounds, Mr. Ferlauto and I might have a difference of opinion on many things. I think what you were trying to communicate is giving shareholders--you can domicile. You can change the corporate domicile at any time you wish. It doesn't matter where you are incorporated.
    I actually think that Senator Johanns was referring to a race to the top and I do think that, while I realize my friend from Delaware may disagree, it actually does give shareholders the ability to influence things and I hope that we will--I am not sure it wouldn't sell and I hope it is something we will understand. I am not sure I understand enough about it myself to support it, but I do know that it certainly would give shareholders much greater freedoms.
    I do want to say to you, Mr. Verret, that I think you were dead on in your opening comments that here we are talking about lots of things, but really what has driven this has been moral hazard, has been what happened with GSEs, and many of the policies we put in place here, the failure of regulators, short-term thinking, credit-rating agencies that didn't do what everyone thought they were doing, and I am not sure about the mark-to-market issue. We might debate that some.
    But I hope that we don't go overboard with what we do here because it is other factors--many other factors--that have created this. I do, on the other hand, think that boards are the final governance issue, and if you have good boards that actually understand the risk, especially at financial institutions, I think we might actually look at differentiating things that have to do with large companies, financial companies that offer systemic risk. We may look at those a little differently.
    But let us get down to this risk. Senator Schumer is close to our Chairman. My guess is that just knowing how things work around here, that he may to defer to him on some of these corporate governance issues. He laid out six things. My sense is that the shareholder ``say-on-pay'' issue as advisory was not particularly controversial amongst most here, is that correct, as an advisory issue.
    The shareholder input didn't seem to be----
"
Mr. Castellani," Why do it every year? Why require it for all companies?
    Senator Corker. And maybe there is a size issue. By the way, I am not agreeing myself necessarily with all these. I am just asking you all. The independent chairperson seemed to be somewhat agreed by half and somewhat disagreed, especially Mr. Castellani, is that correct, thought that was a bad idea.
"
Mr. Castellani," We believe that it should be up to every board of directors and every company to decide what is best for them.
    Senator Corker. Does anybody other than him disagree with what was put forth there?
    Ms. Cross. If I could note, I am not--on behalf of the SEC, I am not expressing views. The Commission hasn't expressed views on all these points.
    Senator Corker. I understand.
    Ms. Cross. By my silence, I am not commenting.
    Senator Corker. I have got you.
    Ms. Cross. Thank you.
    Ms. Yerger. We are believers in one-size-fits-all on this issue.
    Senator Corker. You are believers in that.
    Ms. Yerger. Yes.
    Senator Corker. The stagger board issue, I hope stays in place and is not eliminated, personally. The majority voting issue didn't seem to be a big issue to anybody here. Mr. Castellani, since you represent----
"
Mr. Castellani," Most of our members have majority voting.
    Senator Corker. So not a big deal. So the risk committee is the one issue I think we haven't touched on----
"
Mr. Castellani," It is very important.
    Senator Corker. ----and I just wonder if, since I think we have got pretty good input from you all in these other areas, what are your thoughts, in whatever order you want to give them, on the risk committee issue?
"
Mr. Castellani," Senator, if I might start, I think there probably is going to be pretty close to--well, I don't know whether we would all be unanimous. The fundamental issue, which is whether or not a board of directors should regularly and thoroughly analyze the risks that face the company and its shareholders is not one on which there is any argument. That is one of the fundamental purposes of a board of directors.
    What Senator Schumer in his bill prescribes, however, is not appropriate, and that is that you create a separate committee to do that. Some companies choose to do it within separate committees, but other companies think that it is better done within its audit committee because its greatest risk may be in its financial structures. Some companies do it, because of the nature of the products, in different committees because their greater risk may be either the products or the markets in which they serve as opposed to financial risk.
    So our suggestion is that it is done, but don't specify that you create another committee, particularly where we have already run the risk of being so prescriptive to how many committees and what type of committees boards should have that we run the risk of being the best at governance compliance and the worst at governance implementation.
    Senator Corker. I understand. Is there anybody that strongly disagrees with the position he just put forth?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," Let me just add one caveat to that. I think John is right that there needs to be some flexibility, but there also needs to be some very explicit disclosure about who is responsible for risk, what committee is responsible for it, what is their charter, what powers that they have, how they will review risk, and that needs to be disclosed much more heavily than it does right now.
    Senator Corker. So you would moderate the bill in that way and specify that it doesn't have to have a separate committee, but that function has to take place within the board----
"
Mr. Ferlauto," And it needs to be disclosed to shareholders in a very precise way, OK.
    Senator Corker. So, since I am the last questioner----
"
Chairman Reed," Go ahead.
    Senator Corker. ----let us go back to this issue of the State thing again, which longer-term advocates of shareholder rights have said, look, if we could just give shareholders the ability to race to the top, as Senator Johanns, I think was alluding to, I am not positive--I certainly asked the question earlier in the same light--Mr. Castellani, how do you feel about shareholders being able to say that you are not going to be domiciled in whatever State you are in but you are going to be in Texas because it gives great shareholder rights?
"
Mr. Castellani," Senator, if the majority of the shareholders want to change the logo to pink and make me stand on one leg, I change the logo to pink and stand on one leg. So it really is what the majority of the shareholders. But I think it is not a decision--I think we kid ourselves that this is a decision that is based on what Mr. Icahn is advocating, which is the ability of greater ease of change of control.
    One of the reasons why Delaware is very attractive to corporations is Delaware has an infrastructure, with all deference to my colleague here, that is very efficient in adjudicating issues between companies and shareholders, and shareholders and shareholders, prior to annual meetings or whenever they need to be adjudicated. Delaware is very, very good. They have--what have they got, ten judges and a couple hundred staff people that make decisions very, very quickly. So it is not just the structure of the law that is attractive but it is the ability of the State to implement its law and make decisions when issues are in contention very quickly and very efficiently.
    Senator Corker. But while you are selling Delaware, and I am sure the Chambers of Commerce up there like that----
"
Mr. Castellani," Well, let me give equal. New Jersey is also very good. Ohio is very good----
    [Laughter.]
"
Mr. Castellani," ----and I am sure----
    Senator Corker. Their pension funds must invest in your company.
"
Mr. Castellani," ----Tennessee is very good.
    Senator Corker. But back to the issue of whether they are good or not, and my guess is some of those are not so good that you just mentioned, but giving the shareholders the ability to do that is, in your opinion--and, by the way, by law? You have no problem with that?
"
Mr. Castellani," Yes, I would. Why, again, prescribe for all shareholders of all companies something that they already have the right to do within the States where they are incorporated if the States allow it.
    Senator Corker. Does anybody strongly disagree with that?
"
Mr. Coates," Just so we are clear, currently, shareholders do not have the right----
"
Mr. Castellani," Do not have the right.
"
Mr. Coates," ----do not have the right to force a reincorporation over the objection of the board, and I actually think for once I am on sort of the management side of the Business Roundtable, at least if I heard his comment earlier. I don't think that would be a good idea to introduce. It would be more powerful and more disruptive on behalf of shareholders than anything the SEC is proposing in the current environment.
    Senator Corker. So you think that is a really bad idea?
"
Mr. Coates," Well, I just--I think it would require a great deal of thought about how exactly it would be implemented, and I think to think of it as somehow a weaker version of shareholder proxy access is just descriptively a mistake. It would be actually more empowering----
    Senator Corker. No, I agree.
"
Mr. Coates," OK.
    Senator Corker. It is the most empowering thing, I think, that----
"
Mr. Castellani," And I want to make very clear that I associate myself with those remarks, that that is--I can't imagine what the benefit would be compared to the costs or the disruption.
    Senator Corker. Do you want to make a comment?
"
Mr. Ferlauto," I was just going to say, I think that is true. I think the moderate form is establishing the disclosure right for proxy access. But to go all the way to keep Governors happy, if you will, is to create competition amongst the States by fully empowering shareholders.
    Ms. Yerger. As radical as the Council is, I have to tell you, this is not an issue we have endorsed at this point, is giving owners the right to reincorporate an entity. We are studying it, but I think that it is a complex issue that I would be very surprised the corporate community would support.
"
Mr. Ferlauto," This is the moderate version.
"
Mr. Verret," I would also offer that proposals and changes of State of incorporation get introduced from time to time and the results are always there is pretty low shareholder interest in that.
    Senator Corker. OK. Listen, I want to say that while I ask numbers of questions, I am going to give the same disclosure as the SEC. None of them necessarily represent my point of view. It is just the best way to sort of understand what a very diverse panel of six people think about an issue and I very much appreciate all of your input today.
    I hope that if we do anything on corporate governance, I hope that it is modest and we realize that at the end of the day, a lot of factors led to the failures that we have had today, much of which, candidly, was generated out of this body and those who came before. I hope that we don't create a similar problem or another type of problem by over-legislating how the private sector governs itself. But I thank you all for your testimony.
"
Chairman Reed," Thank you, Senator Corker.
    I want to thank all the witnesses. This has been a very insightful panel, and I particularly thank you for the time and effort you put into this. It was quite obvious from the testimony and from your response to questions.
    Let me say for the record, witnesses' complete written testimony will become part of the hearing record and we are happy to include supporting documentation for the record. The record will remain open for 1 week, until August 5, 2009, for Members to submit their own personal written statements or additional questions for the witnesses. We ask that witnesses respond to any written questions that are sent within 2 weeks and note that the record will close after 6 weeks in order for the hearing print to be prepared.
    With that, I thank you again and thank my colleagues. The hearing is adjourned.
    [Whereupon, at 4:38 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]
    [Prepared statements and responses to written questions supplied for the record follow:]
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF CHAIRMAN JACK REED
    I want to welcome everyone, and thank all of our witnesses for appearing today.
    Today's hearing will focus on corporate boardrooms and try to help us better understand the misaligned incentives that drove Wall Street executives to take harmful risks with the life savings and retirement nest eggs of the American people.
    This Subcommittee has held several hearings in recent months to focus on gaps in our financial regulatory system, including the largely unregulated markets for over-the-counter derivatives, hedge funds and other private investment pools. We have also examined problems that resulted from regulators simply failing to use the authority they had, such as our hearing in March that uncovered defective risk management systems at major financial institutions.
    But although regulators play a critical role in policing the markets, they will always struggle to keep up with evolving and cutting-edge industries. Today's hearing will examine how we can better empower shareholders to hold corporate boards accountable for their actions, and make sure that executive pay and other incentives are used to help companies better focus on long-term performance goals over day-to-day profits.
    Wall Street executives who pursued reckless products and activities they did not understand brought our financial system to its knees. Many of the boards that were supposed to look out for shareholder interests failed at this most basic of jobs. This hearing will help determine where the corporate governance structure is strong, where it needs improvement, and what role the Federal Government should play in this effort.
    I will ask our witnesses what the financial crisis has revealed about current laws and regulations surrounding corporate governance, including executive compensation, board composition, election of directors and other proxy rules, and risk management. In particular, we will discuss proposals to improve the quality of boards by increasing shareholder input into board membership and requiring annual election of, and majority voting for, each board member.
    We will also discuss requiring ``say-on-pay,'' or shareholder endorsements of executive compensation. We need to find ways to help public companies align their compensation practices with long-term shareholder value and, for financial institutions, overall firm safety and soundness. We also need to ensure that compensation committee members--who play key roles in setting executive pay--are appropriately independent from the firm managers they are paying.
    Other key proposals would require public companies to create risk management committees on their boards, and separate the chair and CEO positions to ensure that the CEO is held accountable by the board and an independent chair.
    I hope today's hearing will allow us to examine these and other proposals, and take needed steps to promote corporate responsiveness to the interests of shareholders. I welcome today's witnesses and look forward to their testimony.
                                 ______
                                 
                PREPARED STATEMENT OF MEREDITH B. CROSS  Director, Division of Corporation Finance, Securities and Exchange 
                               Commission
                             July 29, 2009Introduction
    Good afternoon Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Meredith Cross, and I am the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. I just rejoined the SEC staff in June of this year after more than 10 years in private practice here in Washington. I worked at the SEC for most of the 1990s, and I am delighted to be back at the agency at this critical time in the regulation of our financial markets. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Commission today on the topics of corporate governance and the agency's ongoing efforts to assure that investors have the information they need to make educated investment and voting decisions.
    Investor confidence is critical to our securities markets. In the context of the issues that the Subcommittee is discussing today, investors need to feel confident that they have the information they need to make educated decisions about their investments, including whether to reelect or replace members of the board of directors. Good corporate governance is essential to investor confidence in the markets, and it cannot exist without transparency--that is, timely and complete disclosure of material information. In responding to the market crisis and erosion of investor confidence, the Commission has identified and taken steps over the past months in a number of significant areas where the Commission believes enhanced disclosure standards and other rule changes may further address the concerns of the investing public.Shareholder Director Nominations
    A fundamental concept underlying corporate law is that a company's board of directors, while charged with managerial oversight of the company, is accountable to its shareholders who have the power to elect the board. Thus, boards are accountable to shareholders for their decisions concerning, among other things, executive pay, and for their oversight of the companies' management and operations, including the risks that companies undertake. While shareholders have a right under State corporate law to nominate candidates for a company's board of directors, it can be costly to conduct a proxy contest, so this right is only rarely exercised.
    The Commission's proxy rules seek to enable the corporate proxy process to function, as nearly as possible, as a replacement for in-person participation at a meeting of shareholders. With the wide dispersion of stock prevalent in today's markets, requiring actual in-person participation at a shareholders' meeting is not a feasible way for most shareholders to exercise their rights--including their rights to nominate and elect directors. Two months ago, the Commission voted to approve for notice and comment proposals that are designed to help shareholders to more effectively exercise their State law right to nominate directors. \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ ``Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations'', Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-60089 (June 10, 2009). The Commission's vote was 3-2 in favor of the proposal, with Chairman Schapiro and Commissioners Walter and Aguilar voting to approve the staff's recommendation to propose rules, and Commissioners Casey and Paredes voting not to approve the staff's recommendation. For the Commissioners' statements regarding the proposal at the Commission meeting at which the proposal was considered, see http://www.sec.gov/news/speech.shtml#chair.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Under the proposals, shareholders who otherwise have the right to nominate directors at a shareholder meeting would, subject to certain conditions, be able to have a limited number of nominees included in the company proxy materials that are sent to all shareholders whose votes are being solicited. To be eligible to have a nominee or nominees included in a company's proxy materials, a shareholder would have to meet certain security ownership requirements and other specified criteria, provide certifications about the shareholder's intent, and file a notice with the Commission of its intent to nominate a candidate. The notice would include specified disclosure about the nominating shareholder and the nominee for inclusion in the company's proxy materials. This aspect of the proposals is designed to provide important information to all shareholders about qualifying shareholder board nominees so that shareholders can make a more informed voting decision.
    To further facilitate shareholder involvement in the director nomination process, the proposals also include amendments to Rule 14a-8 under the Exchange Act, which currently allows a company to exclude from its proxy materials a shareholder proposal that relates to a nomination or an election for membership on the company's board of directors or a procedure for such nomination or election. This so-called ``election exclusion'' can prevent a shareholder from including in a company's proxy materials a shareholder proposal that would amend, or that requests an amendment to, a company's governing documents regarding nomination procedures or disclosures related to shareholder nominations. Under the proposed amendment to the shareholder proposal rule, companies would be required to include such proposals in their proxy materials, provided the other requirements of the rule are met.
    The proposing release seeks comments from the public on the rule proposals generally and also includes numerous specific questions. The comment process is a critical component of every rule making, and one that the Commission takes very seriously. We sincerely want to hear from all interested parties and truly believe that the rule-making process is better informed as a result of the comments that we receive.Proxy Disclosure Enhancements
    One of the key disclosure documents for shareholders in deciding how to vote in the election of directors is the proxy statement. This document, which includes information about the directors, certain board practices, executive compensation, related party transactions, and other matters, is a critical component of the U.S. corporate governance landscape. The Commission, on July 1, voted to propose a series of rule amendments that are designed to significantly improve proxy disclosures, thereby enabling shareholders to make more informed voting decisions. \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ ``Proxy Disclosure and Solicitation Enhancements,'' Securities Exchange Act Release No.34-60280 (July 10, 2009).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    One area that has garnered significant public attention and can drive investors' investment and voting decisions is executive compensation. The Commission's existing disclosure rules are designed to elicit comprehensive and detailed information about all elements of a company's compensation practices and procedures with respect to its most senior executives. This information includes a ``Compensation, Discussion and Analysis''; detailed tables followed by related narrative disclosure; and a report from the Compensation Committee. Based on this information, investors can form opinions about a company's executive compensation policies, including whether the board of directors has acted appropriately in setting incentives and rewards for management.
    Today, if material, a company must discuss the risk considerations of its compensation policies and decisions with respect to its ``named executive officers.'' (``Named executive officers'' generally include the chief executive officer, chief financial officer, and next three highest paid officers.) Some have argued, however, that the recent financial crisis has demonstrated that a company's compensation practices beyond these five named executive officers can have a dramatic impact on its risk profile; the manner in which some trading arms of financial institutions have been compensated would be an example. Therefore, the Commission has proposed requiring disclosure about how the company incentivizes its employees--beyond the named executive officers--if its compensation policies may result in material risks to the company. This disclosure is intended to enable investors to gauge whether the company's compensation policies create appropriate incentives for its employees, as opposed to creating incentives for employees to act in a way that creates risks not aligned with the risk objectives of the company.
    The Commission's recent proxy enhancement proposals also would require expanded information about the qualifications of directors and director candidates, about the board's leadership structure and role in risk management, and about potential conflicts of interests of compensation consultants. The proposals also would improve the reporting of annual stock and option awards to company executives and directors, and would require quicker reporting of shareholder vote results. The Commission believes that all of this information would enable shareholders to more intelligently exercise their proxy vote, thereby further enhancing corporate accountability.Broker Discretionary Voting
    Also on July 1, the Commission approved changes to New York Stock Exchange Rule 452, which governs broker discretionary voting, to prohibit brokers from voting shares held in street name in director elections unless they have received specific voting instructions from their customers. \3\ NYSE Rule 452 generally allows brokers to vote such shares on behalf of their customers in uncontested director elections, as such elections are currently deemed to be ``routine;'' under the revised rule, such elections will no longer be deemed to be routine. This amendment, which the NYSE approved at least in part based on recommendations from the NYSE's Proxy Working Group, will become effective on January 1, 2010.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ ``Order Approving Proposed Rule Change, as modified by Amendment No. 4, to Amend NYSE Rule 452 and Corresponding Listed Company Manual Section 402.08 to Eliminate Broker Discretionary Voting for the Election of Directors, Except for Companies Registered Under the Investment Company Act of 1940, and to Codify Two Previously Published Interpretations that Do Not Permit Broker Discretionary Voting for Material Amendments to Investment Advisory Contracts with an Investment Company,'' Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-60215 (July 1, 2009). The Commission's vote was 3-2 in favor of the proposal, with Chairman Schapiro and Commissioners Walter and Aguilar voting to approve the rule change, and Commissioners Casey and Paredes voting not to approve the rule change. For the Commissioners' statements regarding the proposal at the Commission meeting at which the rule change was approved, see http://www.sec.gov/news/speech.shtml#chair.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Commission also has asked that the staff undertake--this year--a comprehensive review of other potential improvements to the proxy voting system and rules governing shareholder communications, including exploring whether issuers should have better means to communicate with street name holders. With over 800 billion shares being voted annually at over 7,000 company meetings, it is imperative that our proxy voting process work well, beginning with the quality of disclosure and continuing through to the integrity of the vote results.Say-on-Pay for TARP Companies
    Also on July 1, the Commission proposed amendments to the proxy rules to set out the requirements for a ``say-on-pay'' vote at public companies that that have received (and not repaid) financial assistance under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. \4\ Under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2009, these companies are required to permit an annual advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation. Consistent with the EESA, the Commission's proposals would require public companies that are TARP recipients to provide a separate shareholder vote on executive compensation in proxy solicitations during the period in which any obligation arising from financial assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding. These proposals are intended to clarify what is necessary under the Commission's proxy rules to comply with the EESA vote requirement and help to assure that TARP recipients provide useful information to shareholders about the nature of the required advisory vote on executive compensation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \4\ ``Shareholder Approval of Executive Compensation of TARP Recipients,'' Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34-60218 (July 1, 2009).---------------------------------------------------------------------------Conclusion
    As governance and compensation practices continue to evolve, the Commission will remain vigilant in seeking to assure that our disclosure rules provide investors with the information they need to make informed investment and voting decisions. We know that there also is a great deal of thought and work outside the agency regarding corporate governance and executive compensation best practices, and we stand ready to lend whatever assistance we can in those efforts.
    Thank you again for inviting me to appear before you today and for the Subcommittee's support of the agency in its efforts at this critical time for the Nation's investors. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.

                PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN C. COATES IV John F. Cogan, Jr., Professor of Law and Economics, Harvard Law School
                             July 29, 2009Introduction
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee, I want to thank you for inviting me to testify. Effective corporate governance is a crucial foundation for economic growth, and I am honored to have been asked to participate.A. Are There Any General Lessons for Corporate Governance from the 
        Financial Crisis?
    Some have described the ongoing financial crisis as reflecting poorly on U.S. corporate governance, as with the accounting scandals and stock market bubbles of the late 1990s and early 2000s that led to the Sarbanes-Oxley Act. Unlike those episodes, however, the ongoing financial crisis has not exposed new and widespread problems with the basic governance of most U.S. publicly held corporations. Outside the financial and automotive sectors, most companies have suffered only as a result of the crisis, and did not contribute to or cause it. Stock prices have fallen across the board, but most price declines have more to do with the challenges facing the real economy, and the spillovers from the financial sector on companies in need of new capital, and little to do with any general problem with corporate governance. As a result, we have learned relatively little about many long-standing concerns and debates surrounding the governance of publicly held corporations--and there are few if any easy lessons that can be drawn from the crisis for corporate governance generally.
    I do not mean to minimize those concerns and debates, or suggest lawmakers should remain passive in the field of corporate governance. To the contrary, the crisis makes reform more important and urgent than ever, because well-governed companies recover and adapt more readily than poorly governed firms. But the best reform path will need to attend to differences between governance across industries, and ways that corporate governance interacts with industry-based regulation--and in particular, financial industry regulation--if legal changes are not to make things worse, rather than better. Governance flaws at Citigroup differed dramatically from governance flaws at GM, and attempts to fix the problems at firms like GM through laws directed at all public companies could make things worse at firms like Citigroup.
    One important problem at financial firms was excessive risk-taking, stemming from a so-called ``bonus culture'' of compensation practices strongly linked to share prices. But the risks that financial firms took on were harmful for the Nation as a whole because the financial firms were so important (and complex) and existing resolution authority so weak and poorly designed that those financial firms could not generally be allowed to fail. As a result, in economic terms, financial firms' compensation practices did not take into account the external effects on taxpayers in the event of insolvency. In effect, financial firms were allowed to gamble with taxpayer money. This would have been true even if managers of those firms had been perfect stewards of shareholder wealth. The suggestion of my colleagues Holger Spamann and Lucian Bebchuk (2009)--praised by the New York Times editors earlier this week--that financial firms be required to link compensation to returns on their bonds as well as their common stocks reflects this point. Shareholders are not the only important corporate constituency to consider in setting corporate governance rules for banks.
    At most public companies, the diagnosis has not been the same. If anything, the conventional critique of the governance of nonfinancial companies is that boards and managers have tended (from the shareholder perspective) to be excessively resistant to change, and to have tied executive compensation too weakly with performance. When commentators attempt to link compensation at firms like AIG and claims about excessive executive compensation at public companies generally, they fail to acknowledge that most shareholders do not mind if executives make an enormous amount of money, as long as shareholders also gain. Efforts to increase shareholder power to encourage managers more strongly to pursue shareholder wealth could--at financial firms--undermine efforts by bank regulators to restrain risk-taking by those same firms. The most important practical lesson of the financial crisis is, then, this: whatever form general corporate governance reform takes, careful thought should be given to exempting--or at least allowing relevant financial regulatory authorities to exempt or override--financial firms from those reforms.B. Evidence on Policy Options
    Turning from the general lessons of the financial crisis to some of the specific governance reforms that have been discussed or proposed in the last few years, it is important to bear in mind that corporate governance is not rocket science--in fact, it is much more complicated than rocket science. Corporations are in their simplest sense large groups of people coordinating their activities for profit. Science has a hard enough task tracking inert matter moving through space; it has a harder time predicting the behavior of a single actual or typical human; and it has the hardest time of all attempting to describe or predict how large groups of people will act--if for no other reason than researchers cannot experiment on large groups of people in realistic settings. As a result, there are few consensus views among researchers about any nontrivial topic in corporate governance, and evidence tends to emerge slowly, is rarely uncontested, and is subject to constant (and often dramatic reevaluation). As a result, everything that you do in setting rules for corporate governance should keep the fragility of the evidence in mind: set rules that can be changed by delegating to regulatory agencies; direct those agencies to review and reassess their own rules regularly; and provide ``opt outs'' and ``sunsets'' to governance mandates that are expected to last indefinitely, as at many corporations.
    As one example, to my knowledge, there is no reliable large-scale empirical evidence--good or bad--on the effects of shareholder access to a company's proxy statement, along the lines proposed by the SEC and mandated by S. 1074, H.R. 3269 and H.R. 2861, because there has no been no significant observed variation in such a governance system within any modern developed economy. This does not mean that there is no information relevant to evaluating how such a system would operate in practice, or that there is no basis on which such a system could be recommended or adopted. Rather, the absence of observed variation means that there is no general body of data that is capable of revealing whether such a system would consistently have good or bad effects on shareholder welfare--and no such data will exist unless and until a large number of companies voluntarily adopt such a system or are required to by law. That is generally true of many corporate governance proposals, and to require such data before adopting rule changes would effectively freeze laws governing corporate governance in place indefinitely, preventing further inquiry or development of evidence.
    Nonetheless, there are some corporate governance topics about which evidence is better than others. Here I set out what is necessarily an abbreviated summary of the evidence on three topics addressed in one or more bills pending in the current Congress, including the Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009 (S. 1074): (a) ``say-on-pay,'' (b) mandatory separation of the chairman and CEO positions, and (c) mandatory annual board elections.a. Say-on-Pay
    The proposed requirement that shareholders be given an advisory vote on executive pay has the advantage that it is very similar to a requirement adopted in another jurisdiction (the United Kingdom (U.K.)) that has capital markets and laws that are otherwise similar to those applicable in the United States. \1\ This fact enables a research approach that is otherwise unavailable: a before-and-after test of board and shareholder responses, compensation practices, stock market reactions and shareholder returns, and other items of interest surrounding the adoption of ``say-on-pay'' in the U.K.. Different researchers have conducted several investigations of this kind and the results published at least informally. Those researchers report that ``say-on-pay's'' adoption in the U.K.:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ Say-on-Pay legislation has also been adopted in Australia, Norway, Sweden, and the Netherlands. Deane (2007).
    improved the link between executive pay and corporate ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        performance (Ferri and Maber 2007);
    led firms (both before and after relatively negative 
        shareholder votes) to adopt better pay practices (id.);
    led activist shareholders to target firms with weak pay-
        performance links and those with higher-than-expected executive 
        compensation levels (id.; Alissa 2009);
    did not reduce or slow the overall increase in executive 
        compensation levels (Ferri and Maber 2007; Gordon 2008).Together, these findings suggest that ``say-on-pay'' legislation would have a positive impact on corporate governance in the U.S. While the two legal contexts are not identical, there is no evidence in the existing literature to suggest that the differences would turn what would be a good idea in the U.K. into a bad one in the U.S.
    Researchers have also exploited the introduction of earlier ``say-on-pay'' legislation in the U.S. to examine stock price reactions to the prospect of such a governance reform. Consistent with the U.K. findings, they report that stock investors appear to have viewed the proposed legislation as good for firms with higher-than-typical executive compensation, firms with weak pay-performance links, and firms with weak corporate governance measured in various ways (Cai and Walkling 2009). \2\ They also report data showing that the market reacted positively at most sample firms to the proposed legislation. The same researchers also report that shareholder-sponsored efforts to introduce ``say-on-pay'' rules at individual firms--particularly when sponsored by unions with low stock holdings in the targeted firms--were not well-received by the stock market, in part because they were not directed at firms with higher-than-typical executive compensation or firms with weak pay-performance links, but instead simply at companies that happen to be large. The researchers suggest that their findings show that one-size-fits-all ``say-on-pay'' legislation may be harmful, but this implication does not in fact follow from their findings. If anything, the U.K. evidence summarized above suggests that general ``say-on-pay'' legislation will weaken the ability of special interest shareholder activists to exploit executive compensation as an issue, and will lower the costs of the broad run of shareholders to use their advisory votes on pay to target firms that are most in need of pressure to improve pay practices.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ The authors report that firms with the very weakest corporate governance ratings did not exhibit negative stock price reactions to steps toward to the passage of ``say-on-pay'' legislation, and plausibly suggest that this may be because such firms may not respond to advisory shareholder votes.---------------------------------------------------------------------------b. Mandatory Separation of Chairman and CEO Positions
    In comparison to research on ``say-on-pay'' rules, the evidence on the proposal to mandate the separation of the chair and the CEO of public companies is more extensive and considerably more mixed. At least 34 separate studies of the differences in the performance of companies with split vs. unified chair/CEO positions have been conducted over the last 20 years, including two ``meta-studies.'' Dalton et al. (1998) (reviewing 31 studies of board leadership structure and finding ``little evidence of systematic governance structure/financial performance relationships'') and Rhoades et al. (2001) (meta-analysis of 22 independent samples across 5,271 companies indicates that independent leadership structure has a significant impact on performance, but this impact varies with context). The only clear lesson from these studies is that there has been no long-term trend or convergence on a split chair/CEO structure, and that variation in board leadership structure has persisted for decades, even in the U.K., where a split chair/CEO structure is the norm.
    One study provides evidence consistent with one explanation of the overall lack of strong findings: optimal board structures may vary by firm size, with smaller firms benefiting from a unified chair/CEO position, with the clarity of leadership that structure provides, and larger firms benefiting from the extra monitoring that an independent chair may provide given the greater risk of ``agency costs'' at large companies. Palmon et al. (2002) (finding positive stock price reactions for small firms that switch from split to unified chair/CEO structure, and negative reactions for large firms). If valid, this explanation would suggest that it would be a good idea for any legislation on board leadership to (a) limit any mandate to the largest firms and (b) permit even those firms to ``opt out'' of the requirement through periodic shareholder votes (e.g., once every 5 years).c. Mandatory Annual Board Elections
    The evidence on the last legislative proposal I will address--mandatory annual board elections (i.e., a ban on staggered boards)--is thinner and at first glance more compelling than that on board leadership structure, but on close review is just as mixed. There have been at least two studies that focus on the specific relationship between annual board elections and firm value (Bebchuk and Cohen 2005; Faleye 2007), and a number of other papers that include annual board elections in studying the relationship between broader governance indices and firm value more generally (e.g., Gompers et al., 2003; Cremers and Ferrell 2009). Most (but not all \3\) conclude that annual board elections (either on their own or in combination with other governance practices) are associated with higher firm value, as measured by the ratio of firms' stock prices to their book values. \4\ The governance-valuation studies, however, generally suffer from a well-known ``endogeneity'' problem--that is, it is difficult (and given data limitations, sometimes impossible) to know whether annual elections improve firm value, or firm value determines whether a company chooses to hold annual elections. While there are statistical techniques that can address this issue, none of the studies to date have presented compelling evidence that annual elections lead to better performance, at least in the last 20 years, during which time public companies rarely switched from annual to staggered elections. Moreover, the longer a given study of this type has been available for others to attempt to replicate, the more fragile the findings have appeared to be, suggesting that the bottom-line conclusions of more recent studies may not hold up in the face of continued research.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ Ahn, Goyal, and Shrestha (2009) (finding that annual board elections reduces pay-performance sensitivity and investment efficiency in firms with low monitoring costs, while having the opposite effects on firms with high monitoring costs).
     \4\ Some suggest that the difference in firm value follows from the fact that annual board elections make hostile takeovers easier. See Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell 2009. See also Bebchuk, Coates, and Subramanian 2001 (finding that staggered board elections reduce hostile bid completion rates, conditional on hostile bids being made).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Evidence on annual elections is further complicated by the fact that companies that ``go public'' for the first time continue to adopt staggered board elections at high rates, as late as 2007. \5\ Since the evidence regarding the purported ability of staggered boards to improve firm value has been known for some time, and since shareholders have the ability to adjust the prices they pay for newly issued IPO shares to reflect governance practices, the fact of continued adoption of staggered board elections prior to IPOs suggests that there may be a social advantage to permitting these structures, at least when adopted before a company goes public. Other researchers have made a similar point about ``dual class'' capital structures, which give low or no votes to public investors, while letting founders or their family members retain high vote stock. SEC rules and stock exchange listing standards have for a long time permitted such structures to be adopted in the U.S. only prior to a company going public, and not once a company has gone public. Such structures, as with staggered board elections, have long been thought to reduce firm value, measured by reference to public stock prices. Yet, as with staggered boards, some companies continue to adopt dual class structures--and some have done quite well by their shareholders (e.g., Google Inc.--still up over 300 percent since its IPO despite the recent market meltdown).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \5\ See data available at SharkRepellent.Net, which reported that despite general declines in takeover defenses at public companies in the 2000s, defenses at firms going public continued to increase, with almost \3/4\s of newly public companies adopting staggered boards. See also Coates 2001.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The best explanation offered by academic researchers to explain the continued use of dual class structures and staggered board elections is that they provide founders assurance of continued control, which they value more than the stock price of their companies might reflect. Such private value may arise because of particular attachments the founders have toward the companies they have helped build from scratch, or because they hope to pass control of their companies to their children, or because they have developed ``firm-specific capital'' that they would lose if the company were acquired (and which would be hard to value by outsiders). Some evidence has been developed consistent with these explanations (see Coates 2004, reviewing prior research). This evidence is worth considering not only because dual class structures are analogous to staggered board elections--and interfere with hostile takeovers and shareholder voting rights even more than do staggered board elections--but also because any to mandate annual board elections would also require a ban on dual class structures, or else it would simply push companies to adopt the more restrictive dual class structure in lieu of staggered boards.C. Recommendations
    My recommendations flow from my review of the implications of the financial crisis and my review of evidence above:
    First, any corporate governance reform that attempts to shift power from boards or managers to shareholders should either not include financial firms, or should include a clear delegation of authority to financial regulators to exempt financial firms from these power shifts by regulation. Simply directing financial regulators to regulate the same governance practices (as in H.R. 3269) may not suffice to prevent shareholder pressure from encouraging firms to craft ways around those regulations. It would be better more generally to moderate the pressure of shareholders on financial firms to maximize short-term profit at the potential expense of the financial system and taxpayers.
    Second, ``say-on-pay'' legislation is likely to be a good idea. By enabling shareholders across the board to provide feedback in the form of advisory votes to boards on executive compensation, such a requirement would be likely to increase board scrutiny on one element of corporate governance that has the greatest potential for improving incentives and firm performance in the long run. At the same time, it should be recognized that ``say-on-pay'' is not likely to achieve general distributive goals--wealthy CEOs will continue to earn outsize compensation, as long as their shareholders benefit. If the goal of Congress is to reduce wealth or income disparities, ``say-on-pay'' is not the right mechanism, and executive compensation is only a relatively minor part of the picture. For that reason, efforts to use corporate governance practices--which after all only affect a subset of all U.S. companies, those that have dispersed shareholders--to force a linkage between CEO and employee pay seem to me misguided. It would be better to address pay disparities in the tax code.
    Third, while mandating a split between the chair and the CEO is not clearly a good idea for all public companies, it may well be a good idea for larger companies. Because shareholders of those same companies may find it difficult to initiate such a change, given the difficulties of collective action, a legislative change requiring a split leadership structure but permitting shareholder-approved opt outs may improve governance for many companies while imposing relatively minor costs on companies generally. Requiring that companies give shareholders a vote on such a choice episodically (e.g., every 5 years) would also be a way to help solve shareholders' inevitable collective action problems without forcing a one-size-fits-all solution on companies generally.
    Fourth, mandating that all public companies hold annual elections for all directors is not clearly supported by evidence or theory. It perhaps bears mentioning that other important institutions (the SEC, the Fed, the Senate) permit staggered elections for good reason, and that any rule mandating annual elections would ride roughshod over State law--in Massachusetts, for example, companies are required to have staggered board elections unless they affirmatively opt out of the requirement. In prior writing, I have suggested it be left to the courts to review director conduct with a more skeptical eye at companies that adopted staggered boards prior to the development of the poison pill (Bebchuk, Coates, and Subramanian 2001), and I have also suggested elsewhere reasons to consider ``re-opening'' corporate governance practices put in place long ago (Coates 2004). Both approaches would be better than an across-the-board annual election mandate, which would be likely to lead new companies to adopt even more draconian governance practices without any clear net benefit.
    Finally, precisely because there is no good evidence on the potential effects of shareholder proxy access, it would seem to be the best course to move cautiously in adopting rules permitting or requiring such access. For that reason, the most that would seem warranted for a hard-to-change statute to achieve is to mandate that the SEC adopt a rule providing for such access, and thereby to clarify the SEC's authority to do so. Any shareholder access rule will need to address not only the length of the holding period and ownership threshold required to obtain such access, the ability of shareholders to aggregate holdings to obtain eligibility, rules for independence of nominees and shareholders using the rule, and the availability of the rule to those seeking control or influence of a company. Efforts to specify rules for such access at a greater level of detail will probably miss the mark, and be difficult to correct if experience shows that the access has either provided too much or too little access to accomplish the presumed goal of enhancing shareholder welfare.ReferencesSeoungpil Ahn, Vidhan K.

                    PREPARED STATEMENT OF ANN YERGER
         Executive Director, Council of Institutional Investors
                             July 29, 2009
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee: Good morning. I am Ann Yerger, Executive Director, of the Council of Institutional Investors (Council). I am pleased to appear before you today on behalf of the Council.
    My testimony includes a brief overview of the Council followed by a discussion of our views on the following issues that you informed me were the basis for this important and timely hearing:
    What weaknesses has the financial crisis revealed about 
        executive compensation, board composition, proxy rules, or 
        other corporate governance issues?
    What key legislative and regulatory changes should be 
        considered to ensure shareholders are adequately protected and 
        appropriate incentives exist for optimal long-term performance 
        at companies?
    What information exists about the potential impact of 
        various approaches to improving corporate governance 
        regulation?The Council
    Founded in 1985 the Council is a nonpartisan, not-for-profit association of public, labor and corporate employee benefit funds with assets exceeding $3 trillion. \1\ Today the organization is a leading advocate for improving corporate governance standards for U.S. companies and strengthening investor rights.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ See Attachment 1.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Council members are responsible for investing and safeguarding assets used to fund retirement benefits of millions of participants and beneficiaries throughout the U.S. They have a significant commitment to the U.S. capital markets, with the average Council member investing approximately 60 percent of its entire portfolio in U.S. stocks and bonds. \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    They are also long-term, patient investors due to their investment horizons and their heavy commitment to passive investment strategies. Because these passive strategies restrict Council members from exercising the ``Wall Street walk'' and selling their shares when they are dissatisfied, corporate governance issues are of great interest to our members.
    Council members have been deeply impacted by the financial crisis. As a result, they have a vested interest in ensuring that the gaps and shortcomings revealed by the financial crisis are repaired.What weaknesses has the financial crisis revealed about executive 
        compensation, board composition, proxy rules, or other 
        corporate governance issues?
    The Council believes the financial crisis has exposed some very significant weaknesses in the regulation and oversight of the U.S. capital markets. Gaps in regulation, inadequate resources at existing regulators and failures of regulatory will were key contributors. But so were failures in the corporate boardroom.
    Council members, U.S. citizens, and investors around the globe, have paid the price for these failures. Not only have they suffered trillions of dollars in investments losses, they have also lost confidence in the integrity of our markets and in the effectiveness of board oversight of corporate management.
    A comprehensive review and a meaningful restructuring of the U.S. financial regulatory model are necessary steps toward restoring investor confidence in our markets and protecting against a repeat of these failures. But regulatory reform alone is insufficient, because vigorous securities regulation on its own cannot solve many of the issues that led to the current crisis. The Council believes that many corporate governance failures contributed to this financial crisis. And as a result, the Council believes corporate governance improvements are a critical component of the necessary package of reforms.
    In some cases corporate boards failed shareowners. Some failed to adequately understand, monitor and oversee enterprise risk. Some failed to include directors with the necessary blend of independence, competencies, and experiences to adequately oversee management and corporate strategy. And far too many corporate boards structured and approved executive compensation programs that motivated excessive risk taking and yielded outsized rewards--with little to no downside risk--for short-term results.
    Current rules and regulations also failed shareowners. Today, shareowners around the world--including in countries with far less developed capital markets than the U.S.--enjoy basic rights that shareowners of U.S. companies are denied. Rights such as requiring directors to be elected by majority vote, giving owners advisory votes on executive pay, and providing owners modest vehicles to access management proxy cards to nominate directors are noticeably absent in much of corporate America. Their nonexistence weakens the ability of shareowners to oversee corporate directors--their elected representatives--and hold directors accountable.
    The U.S. has long been recognized as a leader when it comes to investor protection, market transparency, and oversight. But the U.S. has fallen short when it comes to corporate governance issues. The Council believes that corporate governance enhancements are a long overdue and essential component of the bold reforms required to restore confidence in the integrity of the U.S. capital markets.What key legislative and regulatory changes should be considered to 
        ensure shareholders are adequately protected and appropriate 
        incentives exist for optimal long-term performance at 
        companies?
    The Council believes a number of key corporate governance reforms are essential to providing meaningful investor oversight of management and boards and restoring investor confidence in our markets. Such measures would address many of the problems that led to the current crisis, and more importantly, empower shareowners to anticipate and address unforeseen future risks. These measures, rather than facilitating investors seeking short-term gains, are consistent with enhancing long-term shareowner value.
    More specifically, the governance improvements that the Council believes would have the greatest impact and, therefore, should be contained in any financial markets regulatory reform legislation include:
    Majority Voting for Directors: Directors in uncontested 
        elections should be elected by a majority of the votes cast.
    Shareowner Access to the Proxy: A long-term investor or 
        group of long-term investors should have access to management 
        proxy materials to nominate directors.
    Executive Compensation Reforms: Recommended reforms include 
        advisory shareowner vote on executive pay, independent 
        compensation advisers, stronger clawback provisions and 
        enhanced disclosure requirements.
    Independent Board Chair: Corporate boards should be chaired 
        by an independent director. \3\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ See Attachments 2 and 3.---------------------------------------------------------------------------Majority Voting for Directors
    Directors are the cornerstone of the U.S. corporate governance model. And while the primary powers of shareowners--aside from buying and selling their shares--are to elect and remove directors, U.S. shareowners have few tools to exercise these critical and most basic rights.
    The Council believes the accountability of directors at most U.S. companies is weakened by the fact that shareowners do not have a meaningful vote in director elections. Under most State laws the default standard for uncontested director elections is a plurality vote, which means that a director is elected in an uncontested situation even if a majority of the shares are withheld from the nominee.
    The Council has long believed that a plurality standard for the election of directors is inherently unfair and undemocratic and that a majority vote standard is the appropriate one. The concept of majority voting is difficult to contest--especially in this country. And today majority voting is endorsed by all types of governance experts, including law firms advising companies and corporate boards.
    Majority voting makes directors more accountable to shareowners by giving meaning to the vote for directors and eliminating the current ``rubber stamp'' process. The benefits of this change are many: it democratizes the corporate electoral process; it puts real voting power in hands of investors; and it results in minimal disruption to corporate affairs--it simply makes board's representative of shareowners.
    The corporate law community has taken some small steps toward majority voting. In 2006 the ABA Committee on Corporate Laws approved amendments to the Model Business Corporation Act to accommodate majority voting for directors, and lawmakers in Delaware, where most U.S. companies are incorporated, amended the State's corporation law to facilitate majority voting in director elections. But in both cases they stopped short of switching the default standard from plurality to majority.
    Since 2006 some companies have volunteered to adopt majority voting standards, but in many cases they have only done so when pressured by shareowners forced to spend tremendous amounts of time and money on company-by-company campaigns to advance majority voting.
    To date, larger companies have been receptive to adopting majority voting standards. Plurality voting is the standard at less than a third of the companies in the S&P 500. However, plurality voting is still very common among the smaller companies included in the Russell 1000 and 3000 indices. Over half (54.5 percent) of the companies in the Russell 1000, and nearly three-quarters (74.9 percent) of the companies in the Russell 3000, still use a straight plurality voting standard for director elections. \4\ Statistics are not available for the thousands of additional companies not included in these indices; however, the Council believes most do not have majority voting standards.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Plurality voting is a fundamental flaw in the U.S. corporate governance system. It is time to move the default standard to majority voting. Given the failure by the States, particularly Delaware, to take the lead on this reform, the Council believes the time has come for the U.S. Congress to legislate this important and very basic shareowner right.Shareowner Access to the Proxy
    Nearly 70 years have passed since the Securities and Exchange Commission (``SEC'' or ``Commission'') first considered whether shareowners should be able to include director candidates on management's proxy card. This reform, which has been studied and considered on and off for decades, is long overdue. Its adoption would be one of the most significant and important investor reforms by any regulatory or legislative body in decades. The Council applauds the SEC for its leadership on this important issue.
    The financial crisis highlighted a longstanding concern--some directors are not doing the jobs expected by their employers, the shareowners. Compounding the problem is the fact that in too many cases the director nomination process is flawed, largely due to limitations imposed by companies and the securities laws.
    Some boards are dominated by the CEO, who plays the key role in selecting and nominating directors. All-independent nominating committees ostensibly address this concern, but problems persist. Some companies don't have nominating committees, others won't accept shareowner nominations for directors, and Council members' sense is that shareowner-suggested candidates--whether or not submitted to all-independent nominating committees--are rarely given serious consideration.
    Shareowners can now only ensure that their candidates get full consideration by launching an expensive and complicated proxy fight--an unworkable alternative for most investors, particularly fiduciaries who must determine whether the very significant costs of a proxy contest are in the best interests of plan participants and beneficiaries. While companies can freely tap company coffers to fund their campaigns for board-recommended candidates, shareowners must spend their own money to finance their efforts. And companies often erect various obstacles, including expensive litigation, to thwart investors running proxy fights for board seats.
    The Council believes reasonable access to company proxy cards for long-term shareowners would address some of these problems. We believe such access would substantially contribute to the health of the U.S. corporate governance model and U.S. corporations by making boards more responsive to shareowners, more thoughtful about whom they nominate to serve as directors and more vigilant about their oversight responsibilities.
    As such, Council members approved the following policy endorsing shareowner access to the proxy:
        Companies should provide access to management proxy materials 
        for a long-term investor or group of long-term investors owning 
        in aggregate at least three percent of a company's voting 
        stock, to nominate less than a majority of the directors. 
        Eligible investors must have owned the stock for at least 2 
        years. Company proxy materials and related mailings should 
        provide equal space and equal treatment of nominations by 
        qualifying investors.
        To allow for informed voting decisions, it is essential that 
        investors have full and accurate information about access 
        mechanism users and their director nominees. Therefore, 
        shareowners nominating director candidates under an access 
        mechanism should adhere to the same SEC rules governing 
        disclosure requirements and prohibitions on false and 
        misleading statements that currently apply to proxy contests 
        for board seats. \5\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \5\ See Attachment 2, 3.2 Access to Proxy.
    The Council is in the process of submitting a comment letter to the SEC on the Commission's outstanding proposal, Facilitating Shareholder Director Nominations. \6\ While we have some suggested enhancements, the Council by and large is very supportive of the proposal. We firmly believe that a Federal approach is far superior to a State-by-State system.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \6\ 74 Fed. Reg. 29,024 (proposed June 18, 2009), http://www.sec.gov/rules/proposed/2009/33-9046.pdf.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Council believes Congress should support the SEC's efforts by affirming the Commission's authority to promulgate rules allowing shareowners to place their nominees for director on management's card. The Council believes the SEC has the authority to approve an access standard. However others disagree, and the Commission is likely to face unnecessary, costly and time-consuming litigation in response to a Commission-approved access mechanism. To ensure that owners of U.S. companies face no needless delays over the effective date of this critical reform, the Council recommends Congressional affirmation of the SEC's authority.
    Of note, the Council believes access to the proxy complements majority voting for directors. Majority voting is a tool for shareowners to remove directors. Access is a tool for shareowners to elect directors.Executive Compensation Reforms
    As long-term investors with a significant stake in the U.S. capital markets, Council members have a vested interest in ensuring that U.S. companies attract, retain, and motivate the highest performing employees and executives. They are supportive of paying top executives well for superior performance.
    However, the financial crisis has offered yet more examples of how investors are harmed when poorly structured executive pay packages waste shareowners' money, excessively dilute their ownership in portfolio companies, and create inappropriate incentives that reward poor performance or even damage a company's long-term performance. Inappropriate pay packages may also suggest a failure in the boardroom, since it is the job of the board of directors and the compensation committee to ensure that executive compensation programs are effective, reasonable, and rational with respect to critical factors such as company performance and industry considerations.
    The Council believes executive compensation issues are best addressed by requiring companies to provide full, plain English disclosure of key quantitative and qualitative elements of executive pay, by ensuring that corporate boards can be held accountable for their executive pay decisions through majority voting and access mechanisms, by giving shareowners meaningful oversight of executive pay via nonbinding votes on compensation and by requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains pocketed by executives.
    Advisory Vote on Compensation: The Council believes an 
        annual, advisory shareowner vote on executive compensation 
        would efficiently and effectively provide boards with useful 
        information about whether investors view the company's 
        compensation practices to be in shareowners' best interests. 
        Nonbinding shareowner votes on pay would serve as a direct 
        referendum on the decisions of the compensation committee and 
        would offer a more targeted way to signal shareowner discontent 
        than withholding votes from committee members. They might also 
        induce compensation committees to be more careful about doling 
        out rich rewards, to avoid the embarrassment of shareowner 
        rejection at the ballot box. In addition, compensation 
        committees looking to actively rein in executive compensation 
        could use the results of advisory shareowner votes to stand up 
        to excessively demanding officers or compensation consultants. 
        Of note, to ensure meaningful voting results, Federal 
        legislation should mandate that annual advisory votes on 
        compensation are a ``nonroutine'' matter for purposes of New 
        York Stock Exchange Rule 452.
    Independent Compensation Advisers: Compensation consultants 
        play a key role in the pay-setting process. The advice provided 
        by these consultants may be biased as a result of conflicts of 
        interest. Most firms that provide compensation consulting 
        services also provide other kinds of services, such as benefits 
        administration, human resources consulting, and actuarial 
        services. Conflicts of interest contribute to a ratcheting up 
        effect for executive pay and should thus be minimized and 
        disclosed.
    Stronger Clawback Provisions: The Council believes a tough 
        clawback policy is an essential element of a meaningful ``pay 
        for performance'' philosophy. If executives are rewarded for 
        ``hitting their numbers''--and it turns out that they failed to 
        do so--they should not profit. While Section 304 of the 
        Sarbanes-Oxley Act gave additional authority to the SEC to 
        recoup bonuses or other incentive-based compensation in certain 
        circumstances, some observers have suggested this language is 
        too narrow and perhaps unworkable. The Council does not 
        advocate a reopening of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, but it does 
        recommend that Congress consider ways to cover cases where 
        performance-based compensation may be ``unearned'' in 
        retrospect but not meet the high standard of ``resulting from 
        misconduct'' required by Section 304.
    Enhanced Disclosures: Of primary concern to the Council is 
        full and clear disclosure of executive pay. As U.S. Supreme 
        Court Justice Louis Brandeis noted, ``sunlight is the best 
        disinfectant.'' Transparency of executive pay enables 
        shareowners to evaluate the performance of the compensation 
        committee and board in setting executive pay, to assess pay-
        for-performance links and to optimize their role of overseeing 
        executive compensation through such means as proxy voting. The 
        Council is very supportive of the SEC's continued efforts to 
        enhance the disclosure of executive compensation, including its 
        recent proposal to require disclosures about (1) how overall 
        pay policies create incentives that can affect the company's 
        risk and management of risk; (2) the grant date fair value of 
        equity-based awards; and (3) remuneration to executive/director 
        compensation consultants. We believe the disclosure regime in 
        the U.S. would be substantially improved if companies would 
        have to disclose the quantitative measures used to determine 
        incentive pay. Such disclosure--which could be provided at the 
        time the measures are established or at a future date, such as 
        when the performance related to the award is measured--would 
        eliminate a major impediment to the market's ability to analyze 
        and understand executive compensation programs and to 
        appropriately respond.
    As indicated earlier in my testimony, the Council believes that a federally imposed standard for majority voting for directors and a SEC-approved access mechanism will be two of the most powerful tools for addressing executive pay excesses and abuses. Their absence in the U.S. corporate governance model effectively insulates directors from meaningful shareowner oversight. We believe enhancing director accountability via both mechanisms would help rein in excessive or poorly structured executive pay packages.Independent Board Chair
    The issue of whether the chair and CEO roles should be separated has long been debated in the U.S., where the roles are combined at most publicly traded companies. Interest in the issue renewed in recent years in the wake of Enron and other corporate scandals and, most recently, in response to the financial crisis.
    The U.S. approach to the issue differs from other countries, particularly the U.K. and other European countries which have comply-or-disclose requirements regarding the separation of the roles and/or recommend it via nationally recognized best practices. According to the Millstein Center for Corporate Governance and Performance at the Yale School of Management:
        Up until the early 2000s, the percentage of the S&P 500 
        companies with combined roles remained barely unchanged in the 
        previous 15 years, at 80 percent. Today, approximately 36 
        percent of S&P 500 companies have separate chairs and CEOs; 
        this is up from 22 percent in 2002. However, only 17 percent of 
        S&P 1500 firms have chairs that can be qualified as independent 
        and the incidence of independent chairs is concentrated on 
        small and midcap firms. This is in sharp contrast to the 
        landscape of other countries. \7\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \7\ ``Chairing the Board: The Case for Independent Leadership in Corporate North America'' 17 (2009), http://millstein.som.yale.edu/2009%2003%2030%20Chairing%20The%20Board.pdf [hereinafter ``Chairing''].
    At the heart of the issue is whether the leadership of the board should differ from the leadership of the company. Clearly the roles are different, with management responsible for running the company and the board charged with overseeing management. The chair of the board is responsible for, among other things, presiding over and setting agendas for board meetings. The most significant concern over combining the roles is that strong CEOs could exert a dominant influence on the board and the board's agenda and thus weaken the board's oversight of management.
    The Conference Board Commission on Public Trust and Private Enterprise discussed the issue in its post-Enron corporate governance report. \8\ The Commission suggested three approaches--including naming an independent chair--for ensuring the appropriate balance of power between board and CEO functions, and it recommended that ``each corporation give careful consideration, based on its particular circumstances, to separating the offices of the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.'' \9\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     \9\ Id.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    The Council believes separating the chair/CEO positions appropriately reflects the differences in the roles, provides a better balance of power between the CEO and the board--particularly when the CEO dominates the board, and facilitates strong, independent board leadership/functioning.What information exists about the potential impact of various 
        approaches to improving corporate governance regulation?
    Empirical evidence from companies in the U.S. and countries around the globe support the reforms recommended by the Council.Majority Voting for Directors
    Majority voting for directors is not an alien concept. It is standard practice in the United Kingdom, France, Germany, and other European nations. And as discussed, it is also in place at some U.S. companies. The experiences in these countries and in the U.S. indicate that majority voting is not harmful to the markets and does not result in dramatic and frequent changes to corporate boards.Shareowner Access to the Proxy
    Shareowner access to the proxy is a common right in countries around the globe. According to Glass Lewis, the shareowners of companies in the following countries are provided an access mechanism (Country/Requirement):
    Australia--Minimum of 5 percent
    Canada--Minimum of 5 percent
    China--Minimum of 1 percent
    Finland--Minimum of 10 percent
    Germany--Minimum of 5 percent of the issued share capital 
        or shares representing at least =500,000 of the company's share 
        capital
    India--Deposit of INR 500, refundable if the nominee is 
        elected
    Italy--Minimum of 2.5 percent of the company's share 
        capital
    Russia--Minimum of 2 percent of the voting stock
    South Africa--Minimum of 5 percent
    United Kingdom--Minimum of 5 percent or at least 100 
        shareowners each with shares worth a minimum of 100
    In addition, a handful of U.S. companies--including Apria Healthcare and RiskMetrics--have voluntarily adopted access mechanisms. And Delaware recently revised its corporation code to allow corporate bylaws to require that a company's proxy include shareowner nominees for director along with management candidates. The experiences in these countries and in the U.S. indicate that proxy access is not harmful to the markets. Indeed these mechanisms have rarely been used by owners in these markets--powerful evidence that the existence of the mechanism may enhance board performance and board-shareowner communications.Advisory Vote on Compensation
    According to the CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity, the following countries have some form of shareowner vote on executive compensation:
    Australia
    France
    Germany (51 percent of companies researched provide such a 
        vote)
    India
    Italy
    Poland
    Switzerland
    Taiwan
    United Kingdom \10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Again, the experiences in these markets suggest that advisory votes on compensation are not harmful to the markets. And the fact that few compensation schemes are voted down suggests that shareowners are careful stewards of their voting responsibilities and that advisory votes do not require dramatic ``rearview mirror'' adjustments to pay.Independent Board Chair
    Nonexecutive chairs are common in many countries outside the United States. Some 79 percent of companies in the United Kingdom's FTSE 350 index report that they have independent chairs. \11\ Splitting the role of chair and CEO is the norm also in Australia, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, and South Africa. \12\ Again, the experiences in these markets suggest that independent board chairs are not harmful to the markets.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Council is not the only group advocating corporate governance reforms. The Investors' Working Group, an independent task force cosponsored by the Council and the CFA Institute Centre for Financial Market Integrity, issued July 15 a report recommending a set of reforms to put the U.S. financial regulatory system on sounder footing and make it more responsive to the needs of investors. \13\ Noting that ``investors need better tools to hold managers and directors accountable,'' its recommendations include six corporate governance reforms:---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \13\ See Attachment 4.
    In uncontested elections, directors should be elected by a ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
        majority of votes cast.
    Shareowners should have the right to place director 
        nominees on the company's proxy.
    Boards of directors should be encouraged to separate the 
        role of chair and CEO or explain why they have adopted another 
        method to assure independent leadership of the board.
    Securities exchanges should adopt listing standards that 
        require compensation advisers to corporate boards to be 
        independent of management.
    Companies should give shareowners an annual, advisory vote 
        on executive compensation.
    Federal clawback provisions on unearned executive pay 
        should be strengthened. \14\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    The Administration, legislators, and regulators have also recognized the need for corporate governance enhancements. The Council commends the SEC for its bold efforts to date, and it applauds the Obama administration and leaders on Capitol Hill for evaluating corporate governance issues and, in some cases, proposing formal reforms. Many of these proposals would address the key governance shortfalls identified by the Council.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman for inviting me to participate at this hearing. I look forward to the opportunity to respond to any questions.Attachments1.

                PREPARED STATEMENT OF JOHN J. CASTELLANI
                     President, Business Roundtable
                             July 29, 2009Introduction
    Business Roundtable (www.businessroundtable.org) is an association of chief executive officers of leading U.S. companies with more than $5 trillion in annual revenues and nearly 10 million employees. Member companies comprise nearly a third of the total value of the U.S. stock markets and pay nearly half of all corporate income taxes paid to the Federal Government. Annually, they return $133 billion in dividends to shareholders and the economy. Business Roundtable companies give more than $7 billion a year in combined charitable contributions, representing nearly 60 percent of total corporate giving. They are technology innovation leaders, with $70 billion in annual research and development spending--more than a third of the total private R&D spending in the United States.
    We appreciate the opportunity to participate in this hearing on ``Protecting Shareholders and Restoring Public Confidence by Improving Corporate Governance.'' Business Roundtable has long been at the forefront of efforts to improve corporate governance. We have been issuing ``best practices'' statements in this area for three decades, including Principles of Corporate Governance (November 2005), The Nominating Process and Corporate Governance Committees: Principles and Commentary (April 2004), Guidelines for Shareholder-Director Communications (May 2005), and Executive Compensation: Principles and Commentary (January 2007) (attached as Exhibits I through IV). More recently, Business Roundtable became a signatory to Long-Term Value Creation: Guiding Principles for Corporations and Investors, also known as The Aspen Principles, a set of principles drafted in response to concerns about the corrosiveness that short-term pressures exert on companies. The signatories to The Aspen Principles are a group of business organizations, institutional investors and labor unions, including the AFL-CIO, Council of Institutional Investors, and TIAA-CREF, who are committed to encouraging and implementing best corporate governance practices and long-term management and value-creation strategies. In addition, Business Roundtable recently published its Principles for Responding to the Financial Markets Crisis (2009) (attached as Exhibit V), and many of our suggestions have been reflected in the Administration's proposal to reform the financial regulatory system.
    At the outset, we must respectfully take issue with the premise that corporate governance was a significant cause of the current financial crisis. \1\ It likely stemmed from a variety of complex financial factors, including major failures of a regulatory system, over-leveraged financial markets and a real estate bubble. \2\ But even experts disagree about the crisis's origins. \3\ Notably, with the support of Business Roundtable, Congress recently established the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission to investigate the causes of the crisis. \4\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ See Lawrence Mitchell, ``Protect Industry From Predatory Speculators'', Financial Times, July 8, 2009. Professor Mitchell, a George Washington University law professor, argues that it is ``hyperbolic'' to suggest that inattentive boards had anything significant to do with the current recession.
     \2\ See Robert G. Wilmers, ``Where the Crisis Came From'', The Washington Post, July 27, 2009.
     \3\ Ben S. Bernanke, ``Four Questions About the Financial Crisis'' (Apr. 14, 2009), available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20090414a.htm.
     \4\ Stephen Labton, ``A Panel Is Named To Examine Causes of the Economic Crisis'', N.Y. Times, July 16, 2009, at B3.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Because the recently established Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission is just starting its work, any attempt to make policy in response to those purported causes would seem premature. In fact, a legitimate concern is that many of the proposals currently being suggested could even exacerbate factors that may have contributed to the crisis. For example, commentators have asserted that the emphasis of certain institutional investors on short-term gains at the expense of long-term, sustainable growth played a role in the crisis. \5\ Some of the current corporate governance proposals, including a universal ``say-on-pay'' right and the Securities and Exchange Commission's recent proposal for a mandatory process access regime, may actually exacerbate the emphasis on short-term gains. One large institutional investor, the New Jersey State Investment Council, recently expressed this concern, stating that, ``we do not want a regime where the primary effect is to empower corporate raiders with a short-term focus.'' \6\ Thus, we must be cautious that in our zeal to address the financial crisis, we do not jeopardize companies' ability to create the jobs, products, services and benefits that improve the economic well-being of all Americans.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Moreover, the problems giving rise to the financial crisis occurred at a specific group of companies in the financial services industry. Having the Federal Government impose a universal one-size-fits-all corporate governance regime on all public companies based on the experience at a small subset of companies could undermine the stability of boards of directors and place corporations under even greater pressure for short-term performance.
    We also cannot ignore the sweeping transformation in corporate governance practices in the past 6 years, many of which have been adopted voluntarily by corporations, sometimes in response to shareholder requests. Similarly, State corporate law has been the bedrock upon which the modern business corporation has been created and it remains the appropriate and most effective source for law as it applies to corporate governance. It has been responsive to developments in corporate governance, most recently to majority voting for directors, proxy access, and proxy contest reimbursement. Further, the SEC plays an active role in seeing that shareholders receive the information they need to make informed voting decisions, and, in this regard, recently has issued a number of proposals designed to provide shareholders with additional corporate governance information.Recent Developments in Corporate Governance
    The past few years have seen a sea change in corporate governance through a combination of legislation, rule making by the SEC and the securities markets and voluntary action by companies. As long-time advocates for improved corporate governance, Business Roundtable has supported and helped effect many of these changes while simultaneously working to ensure that they provide necessary operational flexibility and avoid unintended negative consequences.Board Independence
    In the past several years, public companies have taken a number of steps to enhance board independence. First, there has been a significant increase in the number of independent directors serving on boards. A 2008 Business Roundtable Survey of member companies (attached as Exhibit VI) indicated that at least 90 percent of our member companies' boards are at least 80 percent independent. According to the RiskMetrics Group 2009 Board Practices, average board independence at S&P 1,500 companies increased from 69 percent in 2003 to 78 percent in 2008. According to the same study, in 2008, 85 percent of S&P 1,500 companies, and 91 percent of S&P 500 companies, had boards that were at least two-thirds independent.
    Second, directors increasingly meet in regular ``executive sessions'' outside the presence of management and 75 percent of our member companies hold executive sessions at every meeting, compared to 55 percent in 2003. Moreover, the NYSE listing standards require a nonmanagement director to preside over these executive sessions and require companies to disclose in their proxy materials how interested parties may communicate directly with the presiding director or the nonmanagement directors as a group.
    Third, there has been a steady increase in the number of companies that have appointed a separate chairman of the board. According to the RiskMetrics Group 2009 Board Practices survey, from 2003 to 2008, the number of S&P 1,500 companies with separate chairmen of the board increased from 30 percent to 46 percent. Moreover, many companies without an independent chair have appointed a lead or presiding director in order to provide for independent board leadership. A 2007 Business Roundtable survey of member companies indicated that 91 percent of companies have an independent chairman or an independent lead or presiding director, up from 55 percent in 2003. According to the 2008 Spencer Stuart Board Index, by mid-2008, 95 percent of S&P 500 companies had a lead or presiding director, up from 36 percent in 2003. Lead directors' duties are often similar to those of an independent chairman and include: presiding at all meetings of the board at which the chairman is not present, including executive sessions of the independent directors; serving as liaison between the chairman and independent directors; approving information sent to the board; approving meeting agendas for the board; approving meeting schedules to assure that there is sufficient time for discussion of all agenda items; having authority to call meetings of the independent directors; being available for consultation and direct communication with major shareholders; and serving as interim leadership in the event of an emergency succession situation. Many companies provide information about their board leadership structures in their corporate governance guidelines, their proxy statements or both, and the SEC recently has proposed to require disclosure about a company's leadership structure and why that structure is appropriate for the company.
    Finally, various organizations are focusing on voluntary steps that companies can take to enhance independent board leadership. In the spring of 2009, the National Association of Corporate Directors, with the support of Business Roundtable, issued a set of Key Agreed Principles To Strengthen Corporate Governance for U.S. Publicly Traded Companies. One ``key agreed principle'' states that boards should have independent leadership, either through an independent chairman or a lead/presiding director, as determined by the independent directors. The principles further recommend that boards evaluate their independent leadership annually. In March 2009, the Chairman's Forum, an organization of nonexecutive chairmen of U.S. and Canadian public companies, issued a policy briefing calling on companies to appoint an independent chairman upon the succession of any combined chairman/CEO. The policy briefing recognizes, however, that particular circumstances may warrant a different leadership structure and recommends, in these instances, that companies explain to shareholders why combining the positions of chairman and CEO represents a superior approach.Majority Voting and Annual Elections
    Companies also have taken steps to enhance accountability through the adoption of majority voting standards for the election of directors and the establishment of annual elections for directors. Historically, most U.S. public companies have used a plurality voting standard in director elections. Under plurality voting, the director nominees for available board seats who receive the highest number of ``For'' votes are elected. In a typical annual election, the number of nominees equals the number of available Board seats, so if at least one share is voted ``For'' the election or reelection of a nominee, the nominee will gain or retain a seat on the Board. Accordingly, director nominees in uncontested elections are assured election. Under a majority voting regime, a candidate must receive a majority of votes cast in order to retain his or her board seat. Majority voting thus increases shareholder influence and encourages greater board accountability.
    In 2004, several labor unions and other shareholder groups began to broadly advocate that companies adopt a majority vote standard in uncontested director elections, in order to demonstrate directors' accountability to shareholders. Companies and shareholders alike recognized the merits of a majority voting standard and this corporate governance enhancement was quickly adopted by many companies. According to our 2008 Survey of Corporate Governance Trends, 75 percent of our member companies have adopted some form of majority voting for directors. According to the leading study on majority voting, as of October 2008, more than 70 percent of S&P 500 companies had adopted some form of majority voting, as compared with only 16 percent in 2006, \7\ and mid- and small-cap companies increasingly are adopting majority voting as well. \8\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    A growing number of companies have moved to annual director elections too. According to the RiskMetrics Group 2009 Board Practices survey, 64 percent of S&P 500 companies held annual director elections in 2008 as compared to only 44 percent in 2004. Likewise, 50 percent of S&P 1,500 companies held annual director elections in 2008, and the number of S&P 1,500 companies with classified boards had decreased to 50 percent in 2008 from 61 percent in 2004. The decrease in the prevalence of classified boards is reflected across mid- and small-cap companies as well. \9\ However, as discussed below, there are reasons why some companies believe it is in the best interests of their shareholders to retain their classified boards.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \9\ See RiskMetrics Group, Board Practices: The Structure of Boards of Directors at S&P 1,500 Companies (2008).---------------------------------------------------------------------------One Size Does Not Fit All
    While Business Roundtable consistently has worked toward enhancing corporate governance practices, we strongly believe that with respect to many of these practices a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach simply will not work. Companies vary tremendously in their size, shareholder base, centralization and other factors that can change over time. Attempting to shoehorn all companies, whether it is a Fortune 50 company or a small company with a single significant shareholder, into the same corporate governance regime deprives companies and their shareholders of choices about the practices that will enable them to operate their businesses in a way that most effectively creates the jobs, products, services, and benefits that improve the economic well-being of all Americans. In this regard, corporate governance initiatives intended to improve corporate functioning and protect shareholders can actually end up harming companies and the interests of the shareholders they were meant to protect. This realization has been echoed by others including the New Jersey Investment Council, which oversees the New Jersey $63 billion public pension system. The Council recently stated in a letter to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro that it is ``troubled by the proliferation of rigid prescriptive responses. which are costly, time-consuming, unresponsive to the individual fact settings surrounding specific companies and industries, and which may correlate only randomly with the creation of shareholder value.'' \10\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    For instance, despite the increasing trend of annual director elections, some companies have concluded that it is in the best interest of their shareholders to retain a classified board. In this regard, some economic studies have found that a classified board can enhance a board's ability to negotiate the best results for shareholders in a potential takeover situation by giving the incumbent directors additional opportunity to evaluate the adequacy and fairness of any takeover proposal, negotiate on behalf of all shareholders and weigh alternative methods of maximizing shareholder value. \11\ In addition, classified boards can have other advantages, including greater continuity, institutional memory and stability, thereby permitting directors to take a longer-term view with respect to corporate strategy and shareholder value. Some recent proposed legislation, however, would deprive boards of directors and shareholders of this choice. \12\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Likewise, Business Roundtable believes that it is critical for boards of directors to have independent board leadership, but a single method of providing that leadership is not appropriate for all companies at all times. While some companies have separated the position of chairman of the board and chief executive officer, others have voluntarily established lead independent or presiding directors. This illustrates the need for, and advantages of, an individualized approach and demonstrates that a universally mandated approach is neither necessary nor desirable. \13\ It would, in fact, deprive boards of directors, and indeed shareholders, of the flexibility to establish the leadership structure that they believe will best equip their companies to govern themselves most effectively for long-term growth and value creation.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Historically, for more than 200 years, State corporations statutes have been the primary source of corporate law and have enabled thoughtful and effective corporate governance policies and practices to be developed. In large part, this stems from the flexibility and responsiveness of State corporate law in responding to evolving circumstances. In this regard, State corporate law is described as ``enabling'' because it generally gives corporations flexibility to structure their governance operations in a manner appropriate to the conduct of their business. It also preserves a role for private ordering and shareholder choice by permitting shareholder proposed bylaws to address corporate governance issues.
    Where a corporation and its shareholders determine that a particular governance structure--such as a majority voting regime--is appropriate, enabling statutes permit, but do not mandate, its adoption. And when changes in State corporate law are determined to be necessary, such as to facilitate changes to a majority voting standard, States responded by amending their statutes. For example, Delaware amended its corporate law to provide that, if shareholders approve a bylaw amendment providing for a majority vote standard in the election of directors, a company's board of directors may not amend or repeal the shareholder-approved bylaw. \14\ Other States have also amended their corporations statutes to address majority voting as well, including California, Nevada, North Dakota, Ohio, Utah, and others. \15\ In addition, the American Bar Association approved amendments to the Model Business Corporation Act, which 30 States have adopted, permitting a company's board or shareholders to adopt majority voting in director elections through bylaw amendments rather than through a more cumbersome process. \16\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     \16\ Model Business Corporation Act 10.22 (2006).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Most recently, in April of this year, Delaware amended its corporate law to clarify the ability of companies and their shareholders to adopt proxy access bylaws, as well as bylaws providing for the reimbursement of expenses incurred by a shareholder in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of directors. \17\ New Section 112 of the Delaware General Corporation Law permits a company to amend its bylaws to provide that shareholders may include in the company's proxy materials shareholder nominees for director positions. The bylaws may condition the obligation to include shareholder nominees on the satisfaction of eligibility requirements and/or compliance with procedures set forth in the bylaws. New Section 113 permits shareholders to adopt bylaws that require the company to reimburse expenses incurred by a shareholder in connection with the solicitation of proxies for the election of directors. The American Bar Association is considering similar amendments to the Model Business Corporation Act. \18\ Like the majority voting enabling legislation described above, these reforms will allow companies and their shareholders to determine whether the costs of proxy access and proxy reimbursement outweigh the benefits for a particular company.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    In contrast to the enabling approach of State corporate law, some recently proposed Federal legislation in response to the financial crisis, the Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009 \19\ and the Shareholder Empowerment Act of 2009, \20\ would mandate specific board structures. Such Federal Government intrusion into corporate governance matters would be largely unprecedented as the Federal Government's role in corporate governance traditionally has been limited. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 did not change the role of the States as the primary source of corporate law; rather, it was a rare instance of Federal action in the area of corporate governance.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Under the existing corporate governance framework, shareholders have the ability to make their views known to the companies in which they invest through a variety of methods. First, many companies provide means for shareholders to communicate with the board about various matters, including recommendations for director candidates and the director election process in general. In this regard, in 2003 the SEC adopted rules requiring enhanced disclosure about companies' procedures for shareholder communication with the board and for shareholders' recommendations of director candidates. \21\ In addition, companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange must have publicized mechanisms for interested parties, including shareholders, to make their concerns known to the company's nonmanagement directors. \22\ The SEC's 2008 rules regarding electronic shareholder forums also provided additional mechanisms for communications between the board and shareholders. \23\ According to a 2008 survey, board members or members of management of nearly 45 percent of surveyed S&P 500 companies reached out to shareholders proactively. \24\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Second, shareholders can submit proposals to be included in company proxy materials. These proposals have been an avenue for shareholders to express their views with respect to various corporate governance matters. For example, the CEO of Bank of America stepped down as chairman of the board this year after a majority of shareholders approved a binding bylaw amendment requiring an independent chair for the company's board. \25\ In addition, predatory shareholder proposals can engender dialogue between companies and shareholder proponents about corporate governance issues. \26\ In this regard, an advisory vote on compensation has been implemented at several companies that received shareholder proposals on this topic. \27\ Moreover, as advocates of such votes have suggested that it is a way to enhance communication between shareholders and their companies about executive compensation, many companies have responded by employing other methods to accomplish this goal. These include holding meetings with their large shareholders to discuss governance issues, as well as using surveys, blogs, webcasts and other forms of electronic communication for the same purpose. \28\---------------------------------------------------------------------------

     \27\ Thus far, in 2009, shareholders have submitted shareholder proposals to over 100 individual companies requesting an advisory vote on executive compensation. In response to previous years' shareholder proposals, many companies are providing shareholders with such a vote, including Aflac Incorporated, H&R Block, Inc., Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, Inc., Littlefield Corporation, RiskMetrics Group, Inc. and Zale Corporation. At least 25 other companies including Intel Corporation, Motorola, Inc. and Verizon Communications, Inc. have agreed to hold an annual advisory vote voluntarily or in response to their shareholders' concerns.
     \28\ A 2007 Business Roundtable survey of member companies indicated that in 2007, board members of 28 percent of companies met with shareholders. Another survey indicates that in 2008, board members or members of management of nearly 45 percent of S&P 500 companies reached out to shareholders proactively. Other companies have established e-mail links on their Web site for investors to provide feedback to the compensation committee. And in April 2009, Schering-Plough Corp. submitted a survey to its shareholders to obtain their views on a variety of compensation issues.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Third, the proliferation of ``vote no'' campaigns in recent years has provided shareholders with another method of making their views known and effecting change in board composition. In these low-cost, organized campaigns, shareholder activists encourage other shareholders to withhold votes from or vote against certain directors. Although ``vote no'' campaigns do not have a legally binding effect where the targeted company uses a plurality voting regime in an uncontested election, evidence indicates that such campaigns are nonetheless successful in producing corporate governance reform. \29\ For example, following a 2008 ``vote no'' campaign at Washington Mutual in which several shareholder groups called for shareholders to withhold votes from certain directors, the finance committee chairman stepped down upon receiving 49.9 percent withheld votes. \30\ In addition, a recent study of ``vote no'' campaigns found that targeted companies experienced improved post-campaign operating performance and increased rates of forced CEO turnover, suggesting that ``vote no'' campaigns are effective. \31\ At companies that have adopted majority voting in director elections, ``vote no'' campaigns are likely to have an even greater impact.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Fourth, the existing framework allows shareholders to make their views known through nominating their own director candidates and engaging in election contests. In fact, they have done so recently at companies including Yahoo! Inc. and Target Corporation. ``Short slate'' proxy contests in which dissidents seek board representation but not full board control, have been very successful in recent years. According to a recent study conducted by the Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, during a 4-year period, short slate proxy contest dissidents were able to gain representation at approximately 75 percent of the companies they targeted. \32\ Significantly, in the majority of these cases, dissidents found it unnecessary to pursue the contest to a shareholder vote; instead, they gained board seats through settlement agreements with the target companies. \33\ Clearly the threat of proxy contests, to say nothing of the contests themselves, is an effective mechanism for shareholder nomination of directors. Moreover, the SEC adopted ``e-proxy'' rules in 2007 that permit companies and others soliciting proxies from shareholders to deliver proxy materials electronically, which has streamlined the proxy solicitation process and greatly reduced the costs of printing and mailing proxy materials. \34\ All of this has made it easier and less costly for shareholders to nominate directors themselves.---------------------------------------------------------------------------

    Finally, increasing numbers of companies have been amending their governing documents to allow shareholders to call special meetings of shareholders or, for companies that already allow shareholders to call meetings, to lower the thresholds required to call those meetings. Currently 45 percent of S&P 500 and 46 percent of S&P 1,500 companies \35\ permit their shareholders to call special meetings, the majority of which require either 25 percent or a majority of the outstanding shares to call a special meeting. Beginning in 2007, shareholder proponents began submitting a large number of shareholder proposals requesting that 10 percent-20 percent of outstanding shares be able to call special meetings. The number of such proposals has increased dramatically since 2007 and these proposals have been receiving high votes. \36\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \35\ Data provided by SharkRepellent.net (S&P 500) and RiskMetrics Group, Inc. (S&P 1,500) as of June 2009.
     \36\ Based on data from RiskMetrics Group, Inc. as of July, in 2009, shareholders have submitted special meeting shareholder proposals to 74 individual companies. The average support for these votes has been 52.3 percent, and 26 companies have received majority votes in support of the proposal.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Clearly, there currently are numerous and potent methods that shareholders can use to see that their voices are heard and their views made known to the companies in which they invest. Accordingly, proposals to increase shareholder rights must be considered in the context of existing shareholder leverage and the manner in which shareholders vote their shares. In this regard, the extensive reliance of many institutional investors on the recommendations of the proxy advisory services must be considered. Unfortunately, these services often do not engage in company-by-company analysis when making their recommendations, applying a one-size-fits-all approach to important corporate governance decisions at individual companies.The SEC Is Addressing Corporate Governance Matters
    While, as noted above, State corporate law is central to corporate governance, the SEC plays a role in assuring that shareholders receive the information they need to make informed voting decisions, including about corporate governance matters. In this regard, earlier this month, the SEC proposed several rule changes intended to provide shareholders with additional disclosure concerning individual director experience and qualifications, board leadership structure and oversight of risk management, compensation practices and potential conflicts of interest with compensation consultants and compensation matters.
    The proposed amendment relating to individual directors would require companies to provide disclosure about (1) the experience, qualifications, attributes and skills of directors and director nominees that qualify them to serve as a director and as a member of each committee on which they serve, (2) all public company directorships held by directors and director nominees during the past 5 years, as opposed to just current directorships (as required under the current rules), and (3) the involvement of directors, director nominees and executive officers in legal proceedings during the prior 10 years.
    With regard to board leadership, the proposal would require disclosure about a company's board leadership structure and why the structure is appropriate for the company. The proposed disclosure would need to include a discussion of whether the company separates or combines the roles of the chairman and chief executive officer, whether the company has a lead independent director, and the board's role in the company's risk-management process and the effects, if any, that this role has on the company's board leadership structure.
    Finally, the proposal relating to compensation consultant disclosures would require enhanced disclosure of potential conflicts of interest involving compensation consultants that provide advice to the board or compensation committee regarding executive or director compensation and also provide other services to the company. Specifically, this disclosure would need to include a discussion of (1) any other services that the compensation consultant or its affiliates provide to the company and the fees paid for such services, (2) the aggregate fees paid for advising on executive and director compensation, (3) whether the consultant was engaged for these other services by or on the recommendation of management, and (4) whether the board or compensation committee approved these other services.
    We believe that this disclosure approach to matters relating to board leadership and risk oversight is far superior to the one-size-fits-all approach in proposed legislation that would mandate the separation of the chairman and CEO position and require all public companies--no matter what size of industry--to establish a risk committee of the board. \37\ Companies and their shareholders should have the choice to determine the structures that will best enable them to grow and prosper.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \37\ See Shareholder Bill of Rights Act of 2009 S. 1074, 111th Cong. 5 (2009) and Shareholder Empowerment Act of 2009 H.R. 2861, 111th Cong. 2 (2009).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In addition to the corporate governance disclosure enhancements described above, the SEC also approved an amendment to NYSE Rule 452, which will prohibit brokers from voting uninstructed shares in director elections. \38\ This rule amendment, which will be effective for annual meetings after January 1, 2010, is likely to have a considerable impact on the director election process, particularly for companies that have adopted a majority voting standard.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \38\ Note that this amendment moots part of section 2 of the Shareholder Empowerment Act of 2009. See Shareholder Empowerment Act of 2009 H.R. 2861, 111th Cong. 2 (2009) which would require that a broker not be allowed to vote securities on an uncontested election to the board of directors of an issuer to the extent that the beneficial owner of those securities has not provided specific instructions to the broker.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    Another significant recent SEC action is the proposal to amend the proxy rules to permit shareholders to nominate directors in a company's proxy materials. If adopted, the proposed rules would establish a Federal proxy access right and permit proxy access shareholder proposals. The Federal process right would permit a shareholder or group of shareholders to nominate one or more directors and have those nominees included in a company's proxy materials contingent on the shareholder or group beneficially owning a certain percentage of the company's voting shares (which varies depending on a company's size) for at least 1 year prior to submitting the nomination. Shareholders meeting the proposal's requirements would be allowed to have their proposed nominees (up to 25 percent of the board) included in the company's proxy statement, on a first-come first-served basis.
    In contrast to our support for the SEC's disclosure proposals, we believe that the proposed Federal proxy access right could result in serious, harmful consequences, as well as being beyond the SEC's authority to adopt. First, widespread shareholder access to company proxy materials will promote a short-term focus and encourage the election of ``special interest'' directors who will disrupt boardroom dynamics and jeopardize long-term shareholder value. Second, the proposed rules will enhance the influence of proxy advisory firms and institutional investors, which may use the rules as leverage for advancing special interest causes and promoting policies to encourage short-term gains in stock price. Third, the increased likelihood of divisive and time-consuming annual election contests could deter qualified directors from serving on corporate boards. Fourth, shareholder-nominated directors could impede a company's ability to satisfy board composition requirements. Finally, serious questions have been raised about the ability of the current proxy voting system to handle the increasing number of proxy contests that would result from the implementation of the proxy access proposal. While the Commission's proposing release touches upon some of these issues, it fails to seriously address them. We currently are preparing a comment letter to the SEC on these proposals which will expand upon our concerns.Conclusion
    Business Roundtable is committed to enhanced corporate governance practices that enable U.S. companies to compete globally, create jobs and generate long-term economic growth. We are concerned, however, that in a rush to respond to the financial crisis, Congress, and the SEC, are considering hastily prepared and universally applicable legislation and regulation that will exacerbate some of the factors that led to the crisis. In particular, an advisory vote on compensation and proxy access could well increase the pressure on short-term performance to the detriment of long-term value creation. The flexible approaches of State corporate law, SEC disclosure and shareholder and company choice that have produced the engine of economic growth that is the American corporation should not be ignored.AttachmentsExhibit I--Principles of Corporate Governance (November 2005)Exhibit II--The Nominating Process and Corporate Governance Committees: Principles and Commentary (April 2004)Exhibit III--Guidelines for Shareholder-Director Communications (May 2005)Exhibit IV--Executive Compensation: Principles and Commentary (January 2007)Exhibit V--Principles for Responding to the Financial Markets Crisis (2009)Exhibit VI--2008 Business Roundtable Survey

                   PREPARED STATEMENT OF J.W. VERRET   Assistant Professor of Law, George Mason University School of Law
                             July 29, 2009The Misdirection of Current Corporate Governance Proposals
    Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and distinguished Members of the Subcommittee, it is a privilege to testify in this forum today.
    My name is J.W. Verret, and I am an Assistant Professor of Law at George Mason Law School, a Senior Scholar at the Mercatus Center at George Mason University and a member of the Mercatus Center Financial Markets Working Group. I also direct the Corporate Federalism Initiative, a network of scholars dedicated to studying the intersection of State and Federal authority in corporate governance.
    I will begin by addressing proxy access and executive compensation rules under consideration and close with a list of contributing causes for the present crisis.
    I am concerned that some of the corporate governance proposals recently advanced impede shareholder voice in corporate elections. This is because they leave no room for investors to design corporate governance structures appropriate for their particular circumstances.
    Rather than expanding shareholder choice, these reforms actually stand in the way of shareholder choice. Most importantly, they do not permit a majority of shareholders to reject the Federal approach.
    The Director of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters said it best, ``we think less is more, fewer votes and less often would allow us to put more resources toward intelligent analysis.'' The Brotherhood of Carpenters opposes the current proposal out of concern about compliance costs. The proposals at issue today ignore their concerns, as well as concerns of many other investors.
    Consider why one might limit shareholders from choosing an alternative means of shareholder access. It can only be because a majority of the shareholders at many companies might reject the Federal approach if given the opportunity.
    Not all shareholders share similar goals. Public Pension Funds run by State elected officials and Union Pension Funds are among the most vocal proponents of shareholder power. Main street investors deserve the right to determine whether they want the politics of Unions and State Pension funds to take place in their 401(k)s.
    The current proposals also envision more disclosure about compensation consultants. Such a discussion would be incomplete without mentioning conflicts faced by proxy advisory firms. Proxy advisory firms advise institutional investors on how to vote. Current proposals have failed to address this issue. The political clout enjoyed by these firms is evidenced by the fact that the CAO of RiskMetrics, the dominant firm in the industry, was recently hired as special advisor to the SEC Chairman.
    To close the executive compensation issue, I will note that if executive compensation were to blame for the present crisis, we would see significant difference between compensation policies at those financial companies that recently returned their TARP money and those needing additional capital. We do not.
    Many of the current proposals also seek to undermine, and take legislative credit for, efforts currently underway at the State level and in negotiations between investors and boards. This is true for proxy access, the subject of recent rule making at the State level, and it is true for Federal proposals on staggered boards, majority voting, and independent Chairmen.
    The Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 and was an unprecedented shift in corporate governance designed to prevent poor management practices. Between 2002 and 2008, the managerial decisions that led to the current crisis were in full swing. I won't argue that Sarbanes-Oxley caused the crisis, but this suggests that corporate governance reform does a poor job of preventing crisis.
    And yet, the financial crisis of 2008 must have a cause. I salute this Committee's determination to uncover it, but challenge whether corporate governance is the culprit. Let me suggest six alternative contributing factors for this Committee to investigate:  i.  The moral hazard problems created by the prospect of Government 
        bailout;  ii.  The market distortions caused by subsidization of the housing 
        market through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal tax policy;  iii.  Regulatory failure by the banking regulators and the SEC in 
        setting appropriate risk-based capital reserve requirements for 
        investment and commercial banks;  iv.  Short-term thinking on Wall Street fed by institutional investor 
        fixation on firms making, and meeting, quarterly earnings 
        predictions;  v.  A failure of credit-rating agencies to provide meaningful 
        analysis, caused by an oligopoly in that market supported by 
        regulation;  vi.  Excessive write downs in asset values under mark-to-market 
        accounting, demanded by accounting firms who refused to sign 
        off on balance sheets out of concern about exposure to 
        excessive securities litigation risk.
    Corporate governance is the foundation of American capital markets. If this Committee tinkers with the American corporate governance system merely for the appearance of change, it risks irreparable damage to that foundation.
    I thank you for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to answering your questions.

               PREPARED STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. FERLAUTO
        Director of Corporate Governance and Pension Investment,
     American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees
                             July 29, 2009
    Good Afternoon, Chairman Reed and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Richard Ferlauto, Director of Corporate Governance and Investment Policy at the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees. AFSCME is the largest union in the AFL-CIO with 1.6 million members who work in the public service. Our members have their retirement assets invested through public retirement systems with more than one trillion dollars in assets. They depend on the earnings of these systems to support their benefits in retirement. Large public pension system investments in the public markets are diversified, largely owning the market, and heavily indexed, which operate with time horizons of 20 years or more to match the benefit obligations they have to their plan participants. Indeed, public pension systems are the foundation of patient capital investment in this economy, which seeks long-term shareholder value creation.
    AFSCME places strong emphasis on improving corporate governance through direct company engagement, regulation, and legislation as a way to achieve long-term shareholder value. As an active shareowner, we have been a leading advocate for a shareholder advisory vote on CEO compensation and shareholder proxy access to nominate directors on company proxy materials.
    I am also chairman of ShareOwners.org, a new nonprofit, nonpartisan social network designed to give a voice to retailers or individuals who rarely have opportunities to communicate with regulators, policy makers, and the companies in which they are invested.
    We urge the Committee to create better protections for the average American investor in the financial marketplace. The severe losses suffered by tens of millions of Americans in their portfolios, 401(k)s, mutual funds, and traditional pension plans all point to the need for a new emphasis on shareowner rights and meaningful regulation in order to ensure the financial security of American families.
    America has tried going down the road of financial deregulation and reduced corporate accountability. That path has proven to be a dead end that is now imperiling the financial well-being of millions of long-term shareowners. Unfortunately, shareholders in America's corporations--who actually should more correctly be thought of as ``shareowners''--have limited options today when it comes to protecting themselves from weak and ineffectual boards dominated by management, misinformation peddled as fact, accounting manipulation, and other abuses.
    Under the disastrous sway of deregulation and lack of accountability, corporate boards and executives either caused or allowed corporations to undertake unreasonable risks in the pursuit of short-term financial goals that were devoid of real economic substance or any long-term benefits. In most cases, it is long-term shareowners--not the deregulators and the speculators--that are paying the price for the breakdown in the system.
    According to a recent scientific survey that the Opinion Research Corporation conducted for ShareOwners.org of 1,256 U.S. investors, ``American investors clearly want to see tough action taken soon by Congress to reform how our financial markets work and also to clean up abuses on Wall Street. Support for such action is strong across all groups by age, income, educational achievement and political affiliation. It is particularly noteworthy that such a high percentage of investors (34 percent) would use a term as strong as `angry' to describe their views about the need for such action. And, even though they are not angry, the additional nearly half of other investors (45 percent) who want to see strong clean-up action taken sends an unmistakable message to policy makers. This is particularly true when you look at that data alongside the finding that nearly 6 out of 10 investors (57 percent) said that strong Federal action would help to restore their lost confidence in the fairness of the markets.'' The full survey from ShareOwners.org is attached as an addendum to this testimony [Ed. note: not included, please see http://www.shareowners.org/profiles/blogs/read-all-about-it], but I would like to point out the following findings:
    More than four out of five American investors (83 percent) 
        agree that ``shareholders should be permitted to be actively 
        involved in CEO pay and other important issues that may bear on 
        the long-term value of a company to their retirement portfolio 
        or other fund.''
    More than four out of five investors (82 percent) agree 
        that ``shareholders should have the ability to nominate and 
        elect directors of their own choosing to the boards of the 
        companies they own.'' Only 16 percent of Americans say that 
        ``shareholders should NOT be able to propose directors to sit 
        on the boards of the companies they own.''
    Nearly nine out of 10 investors (87 percent) say that 
        ``investors who lose their retirement savings due to fraud and 
        abuse should have the right to go to court if necessary to 
        recover those funds.'' Only one in 10 American investors think 
        that ``investor lawsuits clog up the courts and make it more 
        expensive for companies to run their businesses.''
    The number one reason for loss of investor confidence in 
        the markets: ``overpaid CEOs and/or unresponsive management and 
        boards'' at (81 percent).
    It is time for America to get back on the road of prudent financial regulatory oversight and increased corporate accountability. We urge you to recognize the devastating impact that a lack of appropriate regulation and accountability has had on our economy. In order to restore the confidence of investors in our capital markets, it is now necessary to take the following steps:I. Strengthen the regulation of the markets. Key reforms needed to 
        protect the interests of shareowners include the following:
    Beef up the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). 
        Congress should assess the funding needs of the SEC and take 
        steps to bring the agency as quickly as possible to the point 
        that it can fully carry out its mission of oversight of the 
        markets and financial professionals in order to protect and 
        advocate for investors. Among other priorities, the SEC should 
        impose requirements for the disclosure of long and short 
        positions, enhance disclosures for private equity firms bidding 
        for public companies, and require both the registration of 
        hedge fund advisors with the Commission as investment advisors 
        and additional disclosures of the underlying hedge fund. 
        Following the request of the Administration, the SEC should be 
        given additional authority to create a full-fledged fiduciary 
        standard for broker dealers, so that the interests of clients 
        who purchase investment products comes before the self interest 
        of the broker. The SEC Division of Enforcement should be 
        unshackled to prosecute criminal violations of the Federal 
        securities laws where the Department of Justice declines to 
        bring an action.
    Clear the way for forfeiture of compensation and bonuses 
        earned by management in a deceptive fashion. Legislation should 
        be adopted to allow for the ``clawing back'' of incentive 
        compensation and bonuses paid to corporate executives based on 
        fraudulent corporate results, and should provide for 
        enforcement through a private right of action. There is no 
        reason why directors and executives should not give back ill-
        gotten gains when innocent shareowners are victimized by 
        crippling losses. The outrageous bonuses at AIG, Morgan 
        Stanley, and other banks responsible for our financial meltdown 
        were not deserved and should not be allowed to stand. If they 
        know their compensation is on the line, corporate managers and 
        directors will be less likely to engage in or turn a blind eye 
        toward fraud and other wrongdoing.
    Strengthen State-level shareowner rights. Corporation 
        structures and charters are regulated under State law. The 
        corporate law in most States has not clarified the rights, 
        responsibilities and powers of shareholders and directors or 
        ways that they should communicate outside of annual general 
        meetings. If regulation to strengthen shareholder rights does 
        not occur at the Federal level, it will be up to the States to 
        move forward. State corporate law should require proxy access, 
        majority voting and the reimbursement of solicitation expenses 
        in a board challenge. We would encourage robust competition 
        among States for corporate charters based on a race to the top 
        for improved shareowner rights. If necessary, Federal law 
        should be changed to allow for shareholders to call a special 
        meeting to reincorporate in another State by majority vote, in 
        order to avoid being shackled by the corporate State laws that 
        put the interests of management ahead of shareowners.
    Protect whistleblowers and confidential sources who expose 
        financial fraud and other corporate misconduct. Confidential 
        informants--sometimes called ``whistleblowers''--are of 
        immeasurable value in discovering and redressing corporate 
        wrongdoing. The information provided by these individuals may 
        be crucial to victims' ability to prove their claims. Often, 
        these individuals only come forward because they believe their 
        anonymity will be preserved. If their identities were known, 
        they would be open to retaliation from their employers and/or 
        others with an interest in covering up the wrongdoing. 
        Whistleblowers might lose their job or suffer other harm. 
        Legislation is needed to clearly state that the corporate 
        whistleblowers and other confidential informants will be 
        protected when they step forward.II. Increase the accountability of boards and corporate executives. Key 
        reforms needed to protect the interests of shareowners include 
        the following:
    Allow shareowners to vote on the pay of CEOs and other top 
        executives. Corporate compensation policies that encourage 
        short-term risk-taking at the expense of long-term corporate 
        health and reward executives regardless of corporate 
        performance have contributed to our current economic crisis. 
        Shareowners should have the opportunity to vote for or against 
        senior executive compensation packages in order to ensure 
        managers have an interest in long-term growth and in helping 
        build real economic prosperity. The recently enacted stimulus 
        bill requires all companies receiving TARP bail-out funds, 
        nearly 400 companies, to include a ``say-on-pay'' vote at their 
        2009 annual meetings and at future annual meetings as long as 
        they hold TARP funds. It is now time for Congress to implement 
        Treasury Secretary Geithner's plan for compensation reform by 
        passing ``say-on-pay'' legislation for all companies and to 
        make it permanent as the center piece of needed reforms to 
        encourage executive accountability.
    A key item to making the advisory vote meaningful will be not to 
        permit brokers to cast votes on management sponsored executive 
        compensation proposals as was recently done by the SEC in 
        support of changes to NYSE Rule 452 in board elections. 
        Stockbrokers who hold shares in their own name for their client 
        investors have no real economic interest in the underlying 
        corporation but can cast votes on routine items on the proxy. 
        These pay votes are not routine items and should not be treated 
        as such by investors, issuers or the regulators and we do not 
        believe would be the intent of Congress if they give 
        authorization to the SEC to require advisory votes on pay. 
        Brokers almost universally vote for management's nominees and 
        proposals and, in effect, interfere with shareowner supervision 
        of the corporations they own.
    Empower shareowners to more easily nominate directors for 
        election on corporate boards through proxy access. The process 
        for nominating directors at American corporations is dominated 
        today by incumbent boards and corporate management. This is 
        because corporate boards control the content of the materials 
        that companies send to shareholders to solicit votes (or 
        ``proxies'') for director elections, including the 
        identification of the candidates who are to be considered for 
        election. The result is that corporate directors often are 
        selected based on their allegiance to the policies of the 
        incumbent board, instead of their responsiveness to shareowner 
        concerns. Unless they can afford to launch an expensive 
        independent proxy solicitation, shareowners have little or no 
        say in selecting the directors who are supposed to represent 
        their interests. The solution is to enable shareowners, under 
        certain circumstances, to require corporate boards to include 
        information about candidates nominated by shareowners in the 
        company's proxy materials.
    We are very encouraged that the SEC is in the process of rule 
        making on the issue but this is such an important right that we 
        believe that it should not become a political football for 
        future commissions. There needs to be long-term consistency in 
        securities law and the Exchange Act is the appropriate place to 
        clearly codify the authority that the Commission has to require 
        the disclosure of nominees running for board seats. And to 
        further enunciate that access to the proxy is fundamental to 
        free and fair elections for directors.
    Require majority election of all members of corporate 
        boards at American companies. Corporate directors are the 
        elected representatives of shareowners who are responsible for 
        overseeing management. Under the default rule applicable to 
        virtually every corporation in the United States, however, 
        corporate directors can be elected with just a single 
        affirmative vote, even if that director's candidacy is opposed 
        by the overwhelming majority of shareowners. While a few 
        corporations have adopted policies that would require a 
        director to receive support of the majority of shareowners in 
        order to be elected, most corporations--particularly those not 
        in the S&P 500--have not. True majority voting should be 
        mandatory in every uncontested director election at all 
        publicly traded corporations.
    Split the roles of chairman of the board and CEO in any 
        company. (1) receiving Federal taxpayer funds, or (2) operating 
        under Federal financial regulations. It already is the practice 
        in most of the world to divide these two key positions so that 
        an independent chairman can serve as a check on potential CEO 
        abuses. Separation of the CEO and board chair roles helps to 
        ensure good board governance and fosters independent oversight 
        to protect the long-term interests of private shareowners, 
        pension funds and institutional investors. A strong independent 
        chair can help to address legitimate concerns raised by 
        shareowners in a company. Splitting these roles and then 
        requiring a prior shareowner vote to reintegrate them would be 
        in the best interests of investors.
    Allow shareowners to call special meetings. Shareowners 
        should be allowed to call a special meeting. Shareowners who 
        own 5 percent or more of the stock of a company should be 
        permitted, as they are in other countries, to call for a 
        special meeting of all shareowners. They also should be given 
        the right to call for a vote on reincorporation when management 
        and corporate boards unduly use State laws detrimental to 
        shareowner interests to entrench themselves further.III. Improve financial transparency. Key reforms needed to protect the 
        interests of shareowners include the following:
    Crackdown on corporate disclosure abuses that are used to 
        manipulate stock prices. Shareowners in securities fraud cases 
        have always had the burden of proving that defendants' fraud 
        caused the shareowners' losses. When corporate wrongdoers lie 
        to shareowners and inflate the value of publicly traded stock 
        through fraudulent and misleading accounting statements and 
        other chicanery, those culpable parties should be held 
        responsible for the damage wrought on the investing public that 
        is caused by their fraud. Defendants should not be allowed to 
        escape accountability to their shareowners for fraudulent 
        conduct simply by cleverly timing the release of information 
        affecting a company's stock price.
    Improve corporate disclosures so that shareowners can 
        better understand long-term risks. To rebuild shareowner 
        confidence regulators should emphasize transparency by creating 
        more mechanisms for comprehensive corporate disclosure. The SEC 
        should devote particular attention to the adequacy of 
        disclosures concerning such key factors as credit risk, 
        financial opacity, energy and climate risk and those reflecting 
        the financial challenges to the economy as identified by the 
        transition team and the new Administration. The SEC should 
        develop internal expertise on issues such as environmental, 
        social, and governance factors that pose material financial 
        risks to corporations and shareowners, and also to require 
        disclosure of these types of risks.
    Protect U.S. shareowners by promoting new international 
        accounting standards. Our current financial crisis extends far 
        beyond the borders of the U.S. and has affected financial 
        markets and investors across the globe. Part of the problem has 
        been a race to the bottom in favor of a more flexible 
        international accounting standard that would decrease 
        disclosure protection for the average investor. The current 
        crisis makes a compelling case for why we need to slow down the 
        movement toward the use of international accounting standards 
        that could provide another back door route to financial 
        deregulation and further erode confidence in corporate book 
        keeping. A slower time frame is necessary to protect 
        shareowners and allow the Administration to reach out to other 
        governments that share a commitment to high accounting and 
        transparency standards.IV. Protect the legal rights of defrauded shareowners. Key reforms 
        needed to protect the rights of shareowners include the 
        following:
    Preserve the right of investors to go to court to seek 
        justice. Corporate and financial wrongdoers in recent years 
        have effectively denied compensation to victims of fraud by 
        requiring customers to sign away their rights to access Federal 
        courts as individuals and participate with other victims in 
        class actions when their individual claims are small. Absent 
        the ability to proceed collectively, individuals have no means 
        of redress because--as the wrongdoers know--it is frequently 
        economically impossible for victims to pursue claims on an 
        individual basis. The ability of shareowners to take civil 
        actions against market wrongdoers provides an effective adjunct 
        to securities law enforcement and serves as a strong deterrent 
        to fraud and abuse. Shareowners should have the right to access 
        Federal courts individually or as a member of a class action.
    Ensure that those who play a role in committing frauds bear 
        their share of the cost for cleaning up the mess. What is known 
        as private ``aiding and abetting'' liability is well 
        established in criminal law, and private liability for engaging 
        in an unlawful and fraudulent scheme is widely recognized in 
        civil law. In cases of civil securities fraud, however, 
        judicial decisions effectively have eliminated private 
        liability of so-called ``secondary actors''--even when they 
        knowingly participated in fraud schemes. Eliminating the 
        private liability of such ``secondary actors'' as corporate 
        accountants, lawyers and financial advisors has proven 
        disastrous for shareowners and the economy. Most recently, in 
        the subprime mortgage-backed securities debacle, bond rating 
        agencies--who were paid by the very investment bankers who 
        created the securities they were asked to rate--knowingly gave 
        triple-A ratings to junk subprime debt instruments in order to 
        generate more business from the junk marketers. The immunity 
        from private liability that these culpable third parties 
        currently enjoy should be eliminated.
    Allow State courts to help protect investor rights. The 
        previous decade saw the greatest shift in governmental 
        authority away from the States and to the Federal Government in 
        our history. The effect of this shift was to deny individuals 
        their legal rights under State laws and to protect corporate 
        defendants. Corporate interests and an Administration devoted 
        to the ideology of deregulation used the ``doctrine of 
        preemption'' (that Federal law supersedes State law) to bar 
        action at the State level that could have stopped many of the 
        abuses in subprime mortgage lending that are now at the heart 
        of our economic crisis. Indeed, State attorneys general were 
        blocked from prosecuting subprime lenders who violated State 
        laws. The integrity of State law should be restored and both 
        State officials and shareowners should be allowed to pursue 
        remedies available under State law. Federal policy should make 
        clear that State law exists coextensively with Federal 
        regulations, except where State law directly contradicts 
        Federal law.
    In conclusion, I would like to thank the Chairman for the opportunity to testify today. Rebuilding investor confidence in the market depends upon thoughtful policy making that expands investor rights and authorizes the SEC to strengthen its advocacy role on behalf of all Americans' financial security. I would be pleased to answer any questions.
       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                     FROM MEREDITH B. CROSSQ.1. There has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages, but little discussion of the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should be voted on, and how often?A.1. As you noted, this topic has been widely discussed, and a number of issues have been raised. One issue relates to what precisely the shareholders would vote on if given a vote. Shareholders could cast a nonbinding vote on the compensation of executives, as disclosed pursuant to the Commission's compensation disclosure rules. This is what Section 111(e) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 requires for TARP recipients. Alternatively, shareholders could be asked to cast a nonbinding vote on the company's compensation philosophy, policies and procedures, as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis. As you note, another issue to consider would be the frequency of any such vote, which some have suggested either be annually or once every 2-3 years. While these are just a few of the many issues that would need to be considered with regard to shareholder advisory votes on pay, the Commission has not expressed a view about this topic.
    As you may know, the Commission recently proposed rules to implement the ``say-on-pay'' requirement in Section 111(e) of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. The proposed rule would require TARP recipients to provide a separate shareholder vote to approve the compensation of the company's executives in proxies solicited during the period in which any obligation arising from Federal assistance provided under the TARP remains outstanding. In the proposing release, the Commission requested comment about whether the proposed rule should include more specific requirements regarding the manner in which TARP recipients should present the shareholder vote on executive compensation. Any information received in response to that request for comment will be instructive for the proposed rule for TARP companies.Q.2. How do we make sure boards can be an effective check on management?A.2. The recent market crisis has led many to raise serious questions and concerns about the accountability and responsiveness of companies and boards of directors, including questions about whether boards are exercising appropriate oversight of management. State corporate law and stock exchange listing standards play an important role in addressing this question. As for the Commission, in recent months, it has worked diligently to address those questions and concerns. As Chairman Schapiro has said, one of the most effective means of providing accountability is to give shareholders a meaningful opportunity to exercise the rights they have under State law to nominate directors. The Commission's proposed rules to facilitate the ability of shareholders to exercise their rights to nominate directors would provide shareholders a greater opportunity to hold directors accountable. The possibility that shareholders may take advantage of the rules, if adopted, may encourage directors to take a more active role in the oversight of management.
    The Chairman also has stated that shareholders should also be informed about how compensation structures and practices drive an executive's risk-taking. In an effort to improve the information provided to shareholders on this topic, the Commission recently proposed rules to require greater disclosure about how a company and its board manage risks, particularly in the context of setting and overseeing compensation. Requiring companies to provide enhanced disclosure in proxy statements about the relationship of a company's overall compensation policies to risk would enable shareholders to make more informed investment and voting decisions.Q.3. How do we make sure boards and management know what is going on inside the large firms they are supposedly running?A.3. The Chairman believes that directors must be sufficiently independent of management so that they will ask the difficult questions; directors also must be skilled enough to know what questions need to be asked. A qualified and independent board is the best means of ensuring that management is fully engaged. While the Commission generally does not prescribe these governance rules, the Commission's disclosure rules are designed to provide investors--who elect directors--with information about director independence and qualifications.Q.4. Is a better approach to making sure boards and management understand what is going on inside their companies to shrink the size and scope of the companies?A.4. I can assure you that the Commission understands the concerns raised, in light of the recent turmoil in our markets, about board and management oversight of companies; however, determinations regarding the appropriate size and scope of companies is probably best left to markets and shareholders. While we will continue to consider ways that we can enhance our disclosure rules to provide meaningful additional information to investors, we know that Congress is also taking steps to address corporate governance reforms. We look forward to working with you as you move forward, and lending our expertise where appropriate.Q.5. For proxy access, how large of a block of shareholders should have to request that the item be included?A.5. The Commission recently proposed changes to the proxy rules to facilitate shareholder director nominations, which is often referred to as ``proxy access.'' Proposed Rule 14a-11 under the Exchange Act would require, under certain circumstances, a company to include shareholder nominees for director in the company's proxy materials. Under the proposed rule, a nominating shareholder or group would be eligible to have a nominee included in a company's proxy materials if the nominating shareholder or group beneficially owns, as of the date of the shareholder notice regarding the nomination, a certain percentage of the company's securities entitled to be voted on the election of directors, which range from 1 percent to 5 percent depending on the size of the company. The proposal would require a nominating shareholder to have held the securities for at least 1 year. The staff will consider carefully the comments submitted regarding ownership thresholds and other requirements when making a recommendation to the Commission as to the appropriate threshold for any final rule adopted.Q.6. What are issues that shareholders should have an opt out or opt in vote on?A.6. The idea of an opt in or opt out vote has been discussed regarding a number of governance proposals. With respect to our pending proposal to facilitate shareholder director nominations, the Commission requested comment about whether or not shareholders should be able to vote to opt out of the proposed mechanism for shareholder director nominations, or vote to choose a different mechanism to nominate directors. We are currently considering the responses to our request for comment on this issue, which reflect a wide range of views.

       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                     FROM JOHN C. COATES IVQ.1. There has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages, but little discussion of the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should be voted on, and how often?A.1. I would suggest following the U.K. model, as in S. 1074: The shareholder advisory vote would be on the disclosure of compensation to top executives as disclosed in the annual proxy statement, as required by current SEC rules on compensation disclosure and analysis, which calls for a specific report on executive compensation.Q.2. How do we make sure boards can be an effective check on management?A.2. Making boards effective checks on management is one of the central goals of corporate governance--and as I emphasized in my testimony, much uncertainty persists about how to best achieve that goal, even among academic specialists who generally agree on both that goal and how to study progress toward that goal. In general, making sure that shareholders have sufficient information and tools to nominate and elect effective board members is a key first step. A second is to make sure that boards themselves have effective access to information (see answer to Question 3 below). A third is to make sure that boards themselves have the incentives and resources to take action when needed. Each of the steps I favor--``say-on-pay''; making a split chairman/CEO split a default rule for large operating companies, subject to opt out by shareholders; and shareholder access of the kind proposed by the SEC (subject to modifications that were suggested by a number of professors at the Harvard Law and Business Schools, including myself, available here: http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/files/2009/08/hbs_hls-letter-to-sec_0946.pdf--would be helpful steps, as they would represent what are likely to be modest improvements that do not impose irrevocable mandatory rules or high costs on most companies. Still, it should be recognized that ideal corporate governance is not likely to ever be fully achieved, but is something that must be continually pursued.Q.3. How do we make sure boards and management know what is going on inside the large firms they are supposedly running?A.3. As firms grow in size in complexity, it may not be a practical goal to expect boards or even top management to always know everything is going on inside the firms they run, any more than it is practical for officials in the U.S. Government to know everything that is going on inside the organization they oversee. What is important is enable shareholders most effectively to choose and over time modify a system of governance that provides both them and boards with ready access to information about their companies, and with the right incentives and tools to focus on the most important activities their companies undertake, and the most important risks their companies face. What has been disheartening about the recent crisis is that well-regarded boards at prominent financial companies did not seem to be aware of some of the largest risks that their companies faced. This may suggest that there may be natural limits to the size and complexity of an organization that can be safely managed by fallible humans. But if that is true, it would be better, in my view, to let investors provide the feedback to boards about that fact, as they raise the cost of capital for increased growth, or use their rights as investors to control their companies, than for such limits to be pursued directly as a matter of public policy, as some have suggested (other than pursuant to existing antitrust policy, which limits the concentration of any given industry, and thus the size of firms operating in those industries).Q.4. Is a better approach to making sure boards and management understand what is going on inside their companies to shrink the size and scope of the companies?A.4. See answer to Question 3.Q.5. For proxy access, how large of a block of shareholders should have to request that the item be included?A.5. See http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/corpgov/files/2009/08/hbs_hls-letter-to-sec_0946.pdf, where others and I suggest a limit of 5-10 percent. However, as noted in my testimony, I do not believe that this kind of detail in implementing proxy access is something that should be done in legislation--but rather, through SEC rule-making. The most important thing the Congress can and should do on proxy access is to affirm in clear terms that the SEC has the authority to adopt rules in this area, and perhaps to mandate that the SEC revisit its rules after some period of time, and/or report on the effects of proxy access, perhaps with a statutory opt out right for shareholders that do not want their companies to be subject to such rules.Q.6. What are issues that shareholders should have an opt out or opt in vote on?A.6. Nearly all rules of internal governance at public companies should be subject to an opt out or an opt in by shareholders. The only exceptions would be (a) where there is some nonshareholder constituency that might be directly affected by the decision to opt out, (b) where the rules concern disclosure--which is the predicate for investors to exercise their powers (including the power to opt out of default governance provisions), or (c) where the rule is designed to protect minority shareholders from majority or control shareholders, as opposed to insure that managers serve the interests of all shareholders. In general, I favor opt outs where the evidence suggests that the rule in question is beneficial for most companies, as with ``say-on-pay'' advisory shareholder votes, or where the difficulty (legal and/or financial) of opt ins is sufficiently high that shareholders have a difficult time acting collectively to change the governance rules at their companies, as with proxy access (where a combination of costs and legal obstacles--such as past decisions of the SEC itself--have long stymied efforts by shareholders to implement their own rules requiring proxy access). I favor opt ins where the rule is either best for a minority of companies, or where evidence does not support any particular rule as the best for most companies, as long as the ability of shareholders to pursue their own governance systems have not been effectively blocked by costs or legal impediments.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR VITTER
                     FROM JOHN C. COATES IVQ.1. Professor, in your testimony you support the idea of a Government-mandated shareholder vote on compensation or a ``say-on-pay.'' You sight the ``improved link between executive pay and corporate performance in the U.K.'' after its adoption there even though only five companies in England have lost shareholder votes on executive pay this year. Does it occur to you that this ``say-on-pay'' model no longer works? The vast majority of shares in the U.S. aren't held by an average investor sitting at home. If it is true that shares are primarily held by mutual funds and the ownership of the stock is a derivative instrument. How does a Government-mandated ``say-on-pay'' vote get the participation that the 23 companies in the U.S., who have already offered ``say-on-pay'' votes on their own, not get?A.1. The fact that few U.K. firms have lost ``say-on-pay'' votes is not a sign of ``say-on-pay's'' ineffectiveness. It only takes a few high-profile losses for incumbent managers to get the message. That is what the evidence suggests has happened in the U.K. As I noted in my testimony, the best evidence suggests that ``say-on-pay'' tightened the link between pay design and performance, and that many firms improved their pay practices both before and after ``say-on-pay'' votes, including votes that were technically ``won'' because they received bare majorities in favor.
    You are right that most stock is now held by institutions, and only indirectly by individuals. Institutions such as mutual funds, however, owe a responsibility to their investors to use their voting power responsibly, and generally do so, in my view. In effect, institutional investors are representative bodies, as is the Senate. If institutional investors use their ``say-on-pay'' vote powers irresponsibly, they will be disciplined by market forces in many instances, and where markets do not effectively control institutional investors, there may need to be regulation or reform of those institutions through the political process--as may be the case, for example, with public pension funds. But potential problems with institutional shareholders have nothing to do with ``say-on-pay''--if there are problems with institutions, they also extend to ordinary voting rights that they already possess, to vote for and against mergers, for example.
    Finally, you ask why not continue to shareholders of companies effectively opt in to ``say-on-pay,'' as a small number of companies have done, rather than mandate ``say-on-pay'' for all companies? To be clear, I believe that any ``say-on-pay'' rule should permit shareholders to opt out of the rule, and I would expect shareholders at some companies to do so. The rule is thus not a ``mandate'' in the sense of uniformly mandatory. Thus, the difference between the status quo and the rule I would support boils down to whether one thinks that most (not all) companies would be better off with ``say-on-pay.'' As my testimony suggests, the best evidence is that ``say-on-pay'' advisory votes--which, after all, are only advisory, and have no binding effect on companies--improve pay practices generally, and thus would be good for most public companies. What the adoption of ``say-on-pay'' would achieve is to speed up the process of reform, and to eliminate the costs associated with shareholder efforts to adopt the rules that a small but growing number of companies have already adopted. Those costs are substantial--to wage a proxy contest to pressure managers to adopt ``say-on-pay'' rules requires expensive lawyers and regulatory filings, all paid for by shareholders, while incumbent managers use company (i.e., shareholder) funds to oppose those efforts, even (at times) when managers know or expect most shareholders support the rules.
                                ------                                
       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                        FROM ANN YERGERQ.1. There has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages, but little discussion of the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should be voted on, and how often?A.1. There is broad agreement among Council members on the inherent value of an advisory shareowner vote on executive compensation as a feedback mechanism and dialogue tool, but opinions differ on the frequency and type of votes. Many investors, such as the AFSCME Employees Pension Plan, favor one vote every year on the pay of the ``named executive officers (NEOs) set forth in the proxy statement's Summary Compensation Table (the ``SCT'') and the accompanying narrative disclosure of material factors provided to understand the SCT (but not the Compensation Discussion and Analysis).''
    Annual, advisory shareowner votes on executive compensation are required in Australia, Sweden, and the United Kingdom. In fact, U.K. regulations requiring such votes went into effect in 2002, and are held on ``remuneration reports'' covering both the quantitative and qualitative aspects of executive compensation, including the nature of and rationale for performance conditions tied to incentive payouts. ``Say-on-pay'' votes in the U.K. have resulted in ``better disclosure, better and more dialogue between shareholders and companies, and more thought put into remuneration policy by directors,'' according to David Paterson, research director of U.K.-based Research, Recommendations and Electronic Voting, a proxy advisory service. British drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) is a case in point. In 2003, 51 percent of GSK shareowners protested the CEO's golden parachute package by either voting against or abstaining from voting on the company's remuneration report. Stunned, the GSK board held talks with shareowners and the next year reduced the length of executive contracts and set new performance targets, muting investor criticism. Other U.K. companies got the message and now routinely seek investor input on compensation policies.
    The annual-vote aspect of the AFSCME resolution and the U.K. vote aligns with the Council's own policy on the subject, which reads, ``All companies should provide annually for advisory shareowner votes on the compensation of senior executives.'' As mentioned in the background material to the Council's policy, an annual vote would allow shareowners to provide regular, timely feedback on the board's recent executive pay decisions. And annual votes would allow companies and their shareowners to gauge the trend in support for pay decisions. So we do specify that the ``say-on-pay'' vote should be annual and should be on senior executive compensation. But our policy gives boards the flexibility to determine exactly what disclosures should be covered by the vote (i.e., the Summary Compensation Table by itself vs. the SCT plus accompanying qualitative disclosures in the CD&A).
    This was discussed in the background statement to our ``say-on-pay'' policy: ``While the push by investors for shareowner votes on pay has made significant headway in a short time, thoughts are still evolving on how best to implement the reform. Therefore, the Council's draft updated policy endorses the concept of advisory shareowner votes on executive compensation, but stops short of dictating the precise contents of such a vote.''Q.2. How do we make sure boards can be an effective check on management?A.2. As noted by renowned corporate governance expert Nell Minow, ``Boards of directors are like subatomic particles. They behave differently when they are observed.'' The Council of Institutional Investors believes boards would be a more effective check on management if an overwhelming number of directors are independent of management and if shareowners could hold directors accountable for their performance. As a result, the Council strongly supports mechanisms--including majority voting for directors, advisory votes on executive compensation and access to the proxy--that empower shareowners to truly exercise their rights to elect and remove directors.
    We believe federalization of these standards is appropriate and indeed essential to the investing public. While the Council appreciates that 50 governors, and likely many other self-interested parties, oppose federalization of these basic rights, the Council believes their opposition would be overwhelmed by the support of the millions of U.S. citizens and investors who have suffered profound losses from the many market disruptions that have occurred in recent years, including the dot-com bubble, the corporate scandals of the early part of this decade, and most recently, the financial crisis.Q.3. How do we make sure boards and management know what is going on inside the large firms they are supposedly running?A.3. Robust, timely public disclosures are essential for providing outside parties insights into the performance of boards and management of large and small companies.
    Since audited financial statements are a primary sources of information available to guide and monitor investment decisions, tough audit standards and strong accounting standards are critical to ensuring that financial-related disclosures are of the highest quality.
    Auditors, financial analysts, credit-rating agencies and other financial ``gatekeepers'' play a vital role in ensuring the integrity and stability of the capital markets. They provide investors with timely, critical information they need, but often cannot verify, to make informed investment decisions. With vast access to management and material nonpublic information, financial gatekeepers have an inordinate impact on public confidence in the markets. They also exert great influence over the ability of corporations to raise capital and the investment options of many institutional investors. Given their power, the Council of Institutional Investors believes financial gatekeepers should be transparent in their methodology and avoid or tightly manage conflicts of interest. Robust oversight and genuine accountability to investors are also imperative. Regulators should remain vigilant and work to close gaps in oversight. Continued reforms are needed to ensure that the pillars of transparency, independence, oversight and accountability are solidly in place.Q.4. Is a better approach to making sure boards and management understand what is going on inside their companies to shrink the size and scope of the companies?A.4. The Council of Institutional Investors has no formal position on this issue. Regarding entities that may pose a systemic risk to the financial system at large or the economy at large, an independent task force, the Investors' Working Group (IWG), cosponsored by the CFA Institute Centre for Financial Integrity and the Council of Institutional Investors, recommended that policy makers consider the following:
    Designating a systemic risk regulator, with 
        appropriate scope and powers.
    Adopting new regulations for financial services 
        that will prevent the sector from becoming dominated by 
        a few giant and unwieldy institutions. New rules are 
        needed to address and balance concerns about 
        concentration and competitiveness.
    Strengthening capital adequacy standards for all 
        financial institutions. Too many financial institutions 
        have weak capital underpinnings and excessive leverage.
    Imposing careful constraints on proprietary trading 
        at depository institutions and their holding companies. 
        Proprietary trading creates potentially hazardous 
        exposures and conflicts of interest, especially at 
        institutions that operate with explicit or implicit 
        Government guarantees. Ultimately, banks should focus 
        on their primary purposes, taking deposits and making 
        loans.
    Consolidating Federal bank regulators and market 
        regulators. Regulation of banks and other depository 
        institutions may be streamlined through the appropriate 
        consolidation of prudential regulators. Similarly, 
        efficiencies may be obtained through the merger of the 
        SEC and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission 
        (CFTC).
    Studying a Federal role in the oversight of 
        insurance companies.
    IWG members strongly believed that all firms should be able to fail. As a result, it recommended that ``Congress should give regulators resolution authority, analogous to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation's authority for failed banks, to wind down or restructure troubled, systemically significant nonbanks.''Q.5. For proxy access, how large of a block of shareholders should have to request that the item be included?A.5. The Council endorses the following policy regarding shareowner access to the proxy:
    Companies should provide access to management proxy materials for a long-term investor or group of long-term investors owning in aggregate at least 3 percent of a company's voting stock, to nominate less than a majority of the directors. Eligible investors must have owned the stock for at least 2 years. Company proxy materials and related mailings should provide equal space and equal treatment of nominations by qualifying investors.
    To allow for informed voting decisions, it is essential that investors have full and accurate information about access mechanism users and their director nominees. Therefore, shareowners nominating director candidates under an access mechanism should adhere to the same SEC rules governing disclosure requirements and prohibitions on false and misleading statements that currently apply to proxy contests for board seats.Q.6. What are issues that shareholders should have an opt out or opt in vote on?A.6. The Council has no position on opt in/opt out votes for shareowners. Council policies state that ``shareowners should have meaningful ability to participate in the major fundamental decisions that affect corporate viability, and meaningful opportunities to suggest or nominate director candidates and to suggest processes and criteria for director selection and evaluation.''
    In addition, the Council believes a majority vote of common shares outstanding should be sufficient to amend company bylaws or take other action that requires or receives a shareowner vote. Supermajority votes should not be required. A majority vote of common shares outstanding should be required to approve:
    Major corporate decisions concerning the sale or 
        pledge of corporate assets that would have a material 
        effect on shareowner value. Such a transaction will 
        automatically be deemed to have a material effect if 
        the value of the assets exceeds 10 percent of the 
        assets of the company and its subsidiaries on a 
        consolidated basis;
    The corporation's acquisition of 5 percent or more 
        of its common shares at above-market prices other than 
        by tender offer to all shareowners;
    Poison pills;
    Abridging or limiting the rights of common shares 
        to: (1) vote on the election or removal of directors or 
        the timing or length of their term of office or (2) 
        nominate directors or propose other action to be voted 
        on by shareowners or (3) call special meetings of 
        shareowners or take action by written consent or change 
        the procedure for fixing the record date for such 
        action; and
    Issuing debt to a degree that would excessively 
        leverage the company and imperil its long-term 
        viability.
                                ------                                
        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR VITTER
                        FROM ANN YERGERQ.1. One of the proposals you support, which is supported by the Administration, is to allow advisory shareowner votes on executive pay. How would a Government-mandated ``say-on-pay'' vote have prevented the current financial turmoil? How would a government mandated ``say-on-pay'' vote prevent future financial turmoil when, according to the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal Employees, 23 companies have allowed ``say-on-pay'' provisions to proceed to a vote and shareholders have yet to vote down a single executive pay plan in the U.S.?A.1. The Council believes annual advisory shareowner votes on executive compensation would efficiently and effectively provide boards with useful information about whether investors view the company's compensation practices to be in shareowners' best interests. Nonbinding shareowner votes on pay would serve as a direct referendum on the decisions of the compensation committee and would offer a more targeted way to signal shareowner discontent than withholding votes from committee members.
    While advisory votes might not have prevented the current financial crisis nor might they prevent future financial turmoil, they might induce compensation committees to be more careful about doling out rich rewards, to avoid the embarrassment of shareowner rejection at the ballot box. In addition, compensation committees looking to actively rein in executive compensation could use the results of advisory shareowner votes to stand up to excessively demanding officers or compensation consultants.
    Historically, early ``volunteers'' for corporate governance reforms tend to be companies with the best practices and hence, nothing to fear from the reforms. As a result, I am not surprised that shareowners supported the compensation proposals of the 23 companies identified by AFSCME. Of the thousands of other public companies, I expect some would find that their owners do not support their compensation programs, and that this vote will provide meaningful information to board and compensation committees.
    In addition to the 23 companies identified by AFSCME, hundreds of financial firms receiving aid under the U.S. Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) were required to put their executive pay packages to an advisory shareowner vote. And while some received large ``no'' votes, ``on average 88.6 percent of votes cast at 237 firms that have disclosed results were in favor of management, according to an analysis by David G. Wilson, a securities lawyer at Waller Lansden Dortch & Davis who focuses on corporate governance matters,'' according to a September 26, 2009, article in The Washington Post. While some might attribute the high support votes to a failure of the advisory vote concept, others might attribute the support levels to the pay restrictions imposed on these firms by the U.S. Department of Treasury and the 2009 Economic Stimulus Act.

       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                    FROM JOHN J. CASTELLANIQ.1. Professor Coates raised an interesting idea in his written testimony. Rather than forcing a structure on all companies, he suggests an opt out vote by shareholders every few years for some governance proposals. That idea could be applied to proxy access and advisory vote procedures as well instead of the Government deciding what the rules will be. I want to know what you think of that approach, of a mandatory opt in or opt out vote every few years to decide certain matters. Please also comment on whether such a vote should be an opt in or opt out vote.A.1. Business Roundtable believes that shareholders and companies should have the ability to make choices about the governance practices that are most appropriate for their circumstances. However, we do not believe that an ``opt in'' or ``opt out'' vote on different governance practices is necessary. Shareholders already have the ability to communicate their views on whether to adopt particular practices. They can do this through the shareholder proposal process as well as procedures that companies have implemented for shareholders to communicate with the board as a whole and with particular directors. For example, shareholders who believe an advisory vote is necessary at their company can submit shareholder proposals requesting such a vote. If other shareholders agree, they can vote in favor of these proposals, and several companies have implemented advisory votes after proposals on this subject received significant shareholder support. Other companies have taken different approaches to obtaining shareholder views on executive compensation, such as holding meetings with their large shareholders or obtaining shareholder feedback through procedures that allow shareholders to communicate with the board.
    If Congress considers an ``opt in'' or ``opt out'' vote, we believe that an ``opt in'' vote would be preferable. An ``opt in'' vote would require shareholders to take the affirmative step of voting ``for'' a specific governance practice before a company adopts it, which in turn, would provide a more accurate indication that a critical mass of shareholders favors the practice.Q.2. There has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages, but little discussion of the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should be voted on, and how often?A.2. If Congress requires an advisory vote on executive compensation, Business Roundtable believes that it should give companies flexibility to structure the vote based on their individual compensation programs and packages. There are a number of approaches companies could use, and that companies have taken to date, to seek input on executive compensation through an advisory vote. For example, companies could ask shareholders to vote on: (a) the executive compensation tables in the annual proxy statement; (b) the company's compensation philosophy and procedures as described in the Compensation Discussion and Analysis section of the proxy statement; and/or (c) particular aspects of a company's compensation program, such as post-retirement benefits or long-term incentive plans. In addition, there are different approaches companies could take with respect to the frequency of advisory votes. Although many have suggested an annual vote, other practices are likely to emerge. For example, the United Brotherhood of Carpenters Pension Fund has proposed that companies hold advisory votes once every 3 years. Accordingly, Business Roundtable does not believe that a ``one-size-fits-all'' Federal legislative approach to advisory votes on executive compensation is appropriate.
    As an alternative to allowing companies and shareholders to determine the specifics of advisory votes, Business Roundtable believes that Congress should give the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) authority to adopt rules addressing matters such as the frequency of the vote requirement, its applicability to particular businesses or types of businesses, and the matter(s) to be voted on. This administrative flexibility would allow the SEC to tailor the application of voting requirements based on a range of factors and to make changes over time. For example, the SEC proposed rules in July 2009 to help implement the advisory vote requirement in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 applicable to companies receiving funds under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. As the SEC noted in proposing these rules, their purpose is to provide clarity about how to comply with the advisory vote requirement while at the same time affording companies adequate flexibility in making relevant disclosures about the vote.Q.3. How do we make sure boards can be an effective check on management?A.3. Business Roundtable believes that an engaged and diligent board of directors is the most effective mechanism for overseeing management. One of the guiding principles in our Principles of Corporate Governance (2005) states that ``the paramount duty of the board of directors is to select a chief executive officer and to oversee the CEO and senior management in the competent and ethical operation of the corporation on a day-to-day basis.''
    We believe that the best way to provide for effective board oversight is to continue to foster the long tradition of addressing corporate governance matters at the State level through private ordering by shareholders, boards and companies acting within the framework established by State corporate law. In this regard, the corporate governance landscape has undergone a sea change over the past 6 years. Many of the corporate governance practices implemented during this time--such as greater independent board leadership and majority voting in director elections--have occurred as a result of voluntary reforms adopted by companies and their shareholders under the auspices of enabling State corporate law provisions, rather than through legislative or regulatory fiat. Moreover, under State corporate law, directors have fiduciary duties requiring them to act in good faith, in the corporation's best interests, and to exercise appropriate diligence in overseeing the management of the corporation, making decisions and taking other actions. In this regard, there are consequences under State corporate law, as well as the Federal securities laws, for directors who fail to perform their responsibilities.Q.4. How do we make sure boards and management know what is going on inside the large firms they are supposedly running?A.4. Business Roundtable believes that the most effective way for a company's board and management to remain informed is for the company to have effective processes for communicating complete, accurate, and timely information to the attention of the board and management. Information flow between the board and senior management is critical, and well-functioning boards foster an environment that promotes candor and encourages management to bring potential issues to the board early so that there are ``no surprises.'' Moreover, as we recommend in our Principles of Corporate Governance (2005), a company's nominating/governance committee should assess the reporting channels through which the board receives information and see that the board obtains appropriately detailed information in a timely fashion. In situations where specialized expertise would be useful, the board and its committees should seek advice from outside advisors who are independent of the company's management. In addition, it is senior management's responsibility--under the direction of the CEO and CFO--to establish, maintain and periodically evaluate the corporation's: (a) internal controls (controls designed to provide reasonable assurance about the reliability of the company's financial information) and (b) disclosure controls (controls designed to see that a company records, processes and reports information required in SEC filings in a timely manner). In accordance with applicable law and regulations, the CEO and CFO also are responsible for certifying the accuracy and completeness of the financial statements and the effectiveness of the company's internal controls and disclosure controls.Q.5. Is a better approach to making sure boards and management understand what is going on inside their companies to shrink the size and scope of the companies?A.5. Business Roundtable does not believe that this is a better approach, nor is it consistent with the traditional U.S. approach to encouraging a vibrant private sector. Well-structured and well-governed companies have the ability to deal with the size and scope of their businesses because they have solid information flow between the board and management and they maintain effective internal controls.Q.6. For proxy access, how large of a block of shareholders should have to request that the item be included?A.6. Business Roundtable believes that a Federal proxy access right is unnecessary and would have serious adverse consequences, including promoting an unhealthy emphasis on short-termism at the expense of long-term value creation, facilitating the election of ``special interest'' directors, increasing the frequency of contested elections and discouraging qualified directors from serving on corporate boards. Therefore, we do not support a Federal proxy access right. If Congress moves forward in this area, Business Roundtable believes that proxy access should be available only to holders of a significant, long-term interest in a company. Accordingly, we believe that the stock ownership threshold for individual shareholders seeking to place nominees on company proxy statements should be 5 percent of a company's outstanding voting stock and that the threshold for shareholders aggregating their shares should be 10 percent. In either case, a ``net long'' ownership position--that is, full voting and investment power with respect to the shares in question--should be required.
    In addition, we believe that proxy access should be available only to shareholders who have demonstrated a commitment to a company and its business. Accordingly, we believe that shareholders should have to satisfy the relevant stock ownership threshold for a period of at least 2 years before they can nominate a director for inclusion in the company's proxy statement. Any shorter holding period would allow shareholders with a short-term focus to nominate directors who, if elected, would be responsible for the creation of long-term shareholder value. In addition, we believe that shareholders should have to continue to satisfy the relevant ownership threshold not just through the annual meeting at which their nominees are elected, but for the duration of the nominees' service on the board or at least through the term for which they nominated the director.Q.7. What are issues that shareholders should have an opt out or opt in vote on?A.7. As discussed above in the answer to Question 1, we do not believe that an ``opt in'' or ``opt out'' vote on different governance practices is necessary because shareholders already have the ability to communicate their views on whether to adopt particular practices. As an alternative to this approach, Business Roundtable supports enhanced disclosure about companies' corporate governance practices. For example, the SEC recently proposed rules that would require annual proxy disclosure about a company's leadership structure and why the company believes it is the best structure for the company, including discussion about whether the company combines or separates the roles of chairman of the board and CEO and whether the company has a lead independent director. Similarly, Business Roundtable would support a ``comply or explain'' approach, which some non-U.S. markets already follow, that would require companies to disclose whether they have adopted specific governance practices, and if not, why not. Either of these alternatives would allow companies and shareholders flexibility in determining the practices that are most appropriate for them, provide transparency to shareholders and avoid a ``one-size-fits-all'' approach.

        RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR VITTER
                        FROM J.W. VERRETQ.1. Professor, in your testimony you suggest alternative contributing factors for the Committee to investigate to determine the ``culprit'' of the financial crisis. The first factor you suggest to investigate is the moral hazard problems created by the prospect of the Government bailout. Do you think that moral hazard problem is stronger cause of the than corporate pay structure? Do you think the distortions to the housing market cause by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac played a larger role in causing the financial crisis of 2008 than how a company pays its CEO?A.1. Answer not received by time of publication.

       RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                    FROM RICHARD C. FERLAUTOQ.1. Professor Coates raised an interesting idea in his written testimony. Rather than forcing a structure on all companies, he suggests an opt out vote by shareholders every few years for some governance proposals. That idea could be applied to proxy access and advisory vote procedures as well instead of the Government deciding what the rules will be. I want to know what you think of that approach, of a mandatory opt in or opt out vote every few years to decide certain matters. Please also comment on whether such a vote should be an opt in or opt out vote.A.1. The proxy access procedure that has been proposed by the SEC aims to remove regulatory barriers to shareholders' exercise of their existing rights to nominate director candidates. It facilitates shareholders' use of their nomination rights by recognizing that in the modern system of proxy voting, the proxy statement itself is the forum that used to occur at the shareholder meeting. Accordingly, the proxy access procedure is a disclosure measure, rather than a new substantive right. \1\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ I acknowledge that there are some who argue that section 14(a) of the Exchange Act does not authorize the Commission to propose a proxy access procedure. Although I believe that the Commission's authority is clear in this regard, an explicit legislative grant of authority would be useful in order to avoid unnecessary litigation and provide some measure of stability in this area.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    For that reason, I don't believe it would be appropriate for companies to opt in or opt out of the proxy access procedure. In the same way that companies are not permitted to opt out of the application of the SEC's shareholder proposal rule or the executive compensation disclosure requirements, they should not be allowed to opt out of the proxy access procedure.
    Of course, a company should be able to provide its shareholders with a more shareholder-friendly form of access procedure than that established by the SEC's proposed rule. For example, a company could provide that holders of a lower percentage of outstanding shares are entitled to invoke the proxy access procedure, or it could allow nominating shareholders to include longer supporting statements than the SEC's rules contemplate.
    The shareholder advisory vote on executive compensation does not primarily address disclosure, and thus stands on different footing. My main concern about a regime in which ``say-on-pay'' would not apply to companies for some period of time is that it imposes significant delay on the process of obtaining shareholder voice, should shareholders believe that such voice is needed to safeguard shareholder value.
    For instance, one could imagine a regime that would provide for a vote of one kind or another every 3 years. At a company without ``say-on-pay'' where performance begins to suffer shortly before the scheduled vote, but it does not become apparent that the pay-performance relationship has been severed until shortly after the vote, shareholders might have to wait almost 3 years to vote in favor of applying or reinstating ``say-on-pay.'' As Bob Pozen, formerly of Fidelity, stated in criticizing the triggering requirements of the SEC's 2003 proposed proxy access procedure, ``two years is an eternity in this game.'' \2\---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ See ``The Debate on Shareholder Access to the Ballot, Part I'' (transcript of symposium at Harvard Law School in October 2003), at 46 (available at http://www.law.harvard.edu/programs/olin_center/corporate_governance/papers/03.bebchuk.debate-1.pdf).---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    In any event, the collective action problem facing shareholders, which has been exhaustively analyzed in the academic literature, argues in favor of an opt out procedure rather than an opt in procedure. The weight given to management's recommendations on proxy issues--the opt in or opt out proposal would be a management proposal, presumably--the well-documented expense and difficulty attendant to shareholder communication and the vote-boosting effect of the New York Stock Exchange's ``broker-may-vote'' rule on management proposals all argue in favor of making applicability of a governance feature the default, and requiring management to convince shareholders that the company is so well-governed that the governance feature would not be value enhancing.Q.2. There has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages, but little discussion of the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should be voted on, and how often?A.2. As proposed in H.R. 3269, the Corporate and Financial Institution Compensation Fairness Act of 2009, shareholders should be given the opportunity to vote on ``the compensation of executives as disclosed pursuant to the Commission's compensation disclosure rules for named executive officers (which disclosure shall include the compensation committee report, the compensation discussion and analysis, the compensation tables, and any related materials, to the extent required by such rules).'' This vote should occur annually.Q.3. How do we make sure boards can be an effective check on management?A.3. Many factors have an impact on board effectiveness, including the skills, qualifications, and experience of directors; the independence and vitality of the board's leadership; and the quality of the information and advice provided to the board. However, the single most important factor determining whether the board can and will effectively oversee management is whether board members feel they work for the shareholders. If shareholders do not have a meaningful role in nominating and electing directors, they will not engage in robust monitoring. As Relational Investors' Ralph Whitworth has said, ``you dance with who brought you.'' \3\ Accordingly, measures such as proxy access that enable shareholders to more fully exercise their State-law right to nominate directors would be very useful in improving board effectiveness.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \3\ See, id. at 41.Q.4. How do we make sure boards and management know what is ---------------------------------------------------------------------------going on inside the large firms they are supposedly running?A.4. Keeping boards and managements informed enough to do their jobs well requires different strategies. Members of management are employees of the company and devote themselves full-time to its management. The right reporting and information structures to ensure that senior managers are aware of what is happening will vary tremendously from one company to another, depending on the nature of the company's business, the geographical reach of its operations and other factors. As a result, it is not possible to prescribe a single structure that works well for all companies.
    Boards of directors, by contrast, are composed primarily of people from outside the company and they meet to work on company business only periodically. Many board members have demanding day jobs; those who do not are often members of multiple boards or engage in philanthropic or other pursuits that take significant time and attention. Accordingly, information must be collected and synthesized before presentation to the board, in order to use directors' time efficiently.
    It is important that a company's senior management not have a monopoly on the flow of information to the board; if it does, the board functions more as a rubber stamp than as an effective monitor and resource. Independent board leadership is the best way to ensure that directors have access to all the information they need to do their jobs well. An independent board chairman sets the agenda and provides relevant information to directors; he or she will include material furnished by members of senior management but will also be able to provide outside perspectives. Where the chairman is also the CEO, by contrast, his or her perspective will dominate and outside information is less likely to be provided to board members.Q.5. Is a better approach to making sure boards and management understand what is going on inside their companies to shrink the size and scope of the companies?A.5. It is possible that a company's operations may become too large, varied, and dispersed for adequate monitoring to be cost-effective. In the vast majority of cases, however, I believe that the mechanisms discussed in response to Questions 3 and 4 will address the problem of ensuring robust oversight.Q.6. For proxy access, how large of a block of shareholders should have to request that the item be included?A.6. The thresholds proposed by the SEC in its current rule making strike the right balance between ensuring that the access procedure is available only to shareholders with a substantial stake in the company and fulfilling the objective of removing obstacles to the exercise of shareholders' State-law director nomination rights.Q.7. What are issues that shareholders should have an opt out or opt in vote on?A.7. I do not favor, in the first instance, an opt in or opt out regime for the governance reforms discussed at the hearing. As discussed in the answer to Question 1, an opt in or opt out process is not appropriate for disclosure measures. For other reforms, my support of an opt out regime would depend on how often the vote was held and whether shareholders could quickly trigger an earlier vote if circumstances warranted."
