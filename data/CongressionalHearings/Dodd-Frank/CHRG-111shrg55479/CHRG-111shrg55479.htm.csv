"Chairman Reed","Let me call the hearing to order and welcome our witnesses. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. We expect momentarily that the Ranking Member will arrive, and I thank Senator Corker and Senator Menendez for joining us. Today's hearing will focus on corporate boardrooms and try to help us better understand the misaligned incentives that drove Wall Street executives to take harmful risks with the life savings and retirement income of so many people. This Subcommittee has held several hearings in recent months to focus on gaps in our financial regulatory system, including the largely unregulated markets for over-the-counter derivatives, hedge funds, and other private investment pools. We have also examined problems that resulted from regulators simply failing to use the authority they had, such as our hearing in March that uncovered defective risk management systems at major financial institutions. But although regulators play a critical role in policing the markets, they will always struggle to keep up with evolving and cutting-edge industries. Today's hearing will examine how we can better empower shareholders to hold corporate boards accountable for their actions and make sure that executive pay and other incentives are used to help companies better focus on long-term performance goals over day-to-day profits. In this latter regard, this is a timely hearing based on the action yesterday of the House Financial Services Committee. Wall Street executives who pursued reckless products and activities they did not understand brought our financial system to this crisis. Many of the boards that were supposed to look out for shareholders' interests failed at this most basic of jobs. This hearing will help determine where the corporate governance structure is strong, where it needs improvement, and what role the Federal Government should play in this effort. I will ask our witnesses what the financial crisis has revealed about current laws and regulations surrounding corporate governance, including executive compensation, board composition, election of directors and other proxy rules, and risk management. In particular, we will discuss proposals to improve the quality of boards by increasing shareholder input into board membership and requiring annual election of and majority voting for each board member. We will also discuss requiring ``say-on-pay,'' or shareholder endorsements of executive compensation. We need to find ways to help public companies align their compensation practices with long-term shareholder value and for financial institutions overall firm safety and soundness. We also need to ensure that compensation committee members who play key roles in setting executive pay are appropriately independent from the firm managers that they are paying. Other key proposals would require public companies to create risk management activities on their boards and separate the chair and CEO positions to ensure that the CEO is held accountable by the board and an independent chair. I hope today's hearing will allow us to examine these and other proposals and take needed steps to promote corporate responsiveness to the interests of shareholders, and I welcome today's witnesses and look forward to the testimony. Now let me recognize Senator Bunning.","Speech",""
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am sorry I am just a little late. Phone calls are a pain right now. This is a very important topic for us, but a hard one to deal with. While we may be able to make some reforms that will promote good long-term performance and responsible behavior, we will not, I say, be able to prevent bad decisions or failures. After all, we cannot legislate good judgment or ethics. And we already have the ultimate form of accountability through bankruptcy. In general, pay should promote good long-term performance, and shareholders must share in the gain, not just executives and traders. Boards must be more involved--I say that again: Boards must be more involved and be an effective check on management. Proxy access must benefit the majority of stockholders and encourage long-term values. If we are not careful, those changes could have the exact opposite effect by empowering a minority of shareholders to strip the company of value and encourage risky behavior in search of short-term profits. While we are right to be outraged at what has gone on in the financial sector, we must be careful that efforts to rein in Wall Street's behavior do not put handcuffs on other businesses that have different needs and challenges. Corporate law for the first 230-plus years of this country has been handled pretty well at the State level, and if we are going to change that, we should be sure of what we are doing. And I am sure looking forward to hearing what our panel has to say. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING"
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Senator Bunning. Senator Corker, do you have any opening comments?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","As always, I prefer to listen to the witnesses and ask questions, but thank you all for being here.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator. Senator Schumer has arrived, and I know he has taken a leadership role on this issue of corporate governance with his legislative proposals and his constant attention. In fact, it was Senator Schumer's suggestion that we hold this hearing, so I want to recognize him for any comments that he might have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Well, thank you, Senator Reed, and let me express my profound gratitude to you for holding this hearing and to Ranking Member Bunning for being here as well on such an important subject. As you acknowledged, Mr. Chairman, corporate governance is of great importance to me, and I introduced the Shareholder Bill of Rights with Senator Cantwell earlier this year. The bill was supported by 20 major pension funds, consumer groups, labor unions, and just yesterday, the House Financial Services Committee passed a ``say-on-pay'' bill similar to the ``say-on- pay'' we have in the Shareholder Bill of Rights. So I am glad to see Congress is moving forward in this process, and today's hearing is a great opportunity to get a chance to explore these issues in more detail. In the last year-plus, we have talked a great deal about the failures of regulation and Government oversight in the financial system. But our dynamic economy and capital markets also depend on internal oversight by vigilant boards of directors who ensure that management is steering the ship in the right direction. Unfortunately, there are far too many cases recently where boards of directors, not just regulators, were asleep at the wheel, or even complicit in practices that caused great harm to our economy and shook public confidence in our capital markets. Executives who encouraged risk-taking that they did not understand were not checked by their boards. Compensation packages that rewarded short-term actions but not long-term thinking were not undone by their boards. Fundamentally, too many boards neglected their most important job: prioritizing the long-time health of their firms and their shareholders and carefully overseeing management. In other words, there was widespread failure of corporate governance that has proven disastrous not just for individual businesses but for the economy as a whole. And there are many in this room on both sides of the aisle who say, you know, the Government cannot get involved in the details of what a company does. And that is right. That is our free market system. But the place that there is supposed to be a check is in the board of directors, and when over the years in too many companies--there are many companies that have good boards and many companies that already have implemented many if not all the reforms in our bill. But in too many companies, the boards did not do the job. And the damage. What if the board of AIG had checked some of its actions? What is the board of Bear Stearns had checked some of its actions? The taxpayers probably would have saved hundreds of billions of dollars. So it affects all of us. It is not just the internals of the company. And so Senator Cantwell introduced our bill. It makes corporate boards accountable to the shareholders whose interests they are supposed to protect. The Shareholder Bill of Rights will go a long way to making sure that these failures do not happen again, and as everyone knows, there are six key components in our bill. I am not going to read them. I am going to save that in the interest of time. Several elements of the bill have already been in place, as I said, by many corporations, and that is important to remember, because for many corporations, these are already best practices. Well-run companies do not fear their shareholders because they recognize that boards, management, and shareholders share the same interests: long-term growth and profitability. The greatest damage occurs not when boards are too active, but when they are not active enough. I think the Shareholder Bill of Rights will go a long way to ensuring that companies are responsive to their shareholders' interests. I thank you and congratulate you, Chairman Reed, for putting together an excellent panel. I look forward to the hearing, the testimony of the witnesses, and I would ask that my entire statement be put in the record.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. SCHUMER"

"Senator Corker","Let me say this. I want to, for the record, note that I usually do not like to hear any opening comments, but in this case, since----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Yes, well, thank you. And I was going to say, similar to what Jack Reed said, this is the first time that someone has asked Chuck Schumer to say more on a subject than he has said. Here they are. First, we require all public companies hold an advisory shareholder vote on executive compensation and obtain shareholder approval for golden parachutes. Second, we instruct the SEC to issue rules allowing long- term shareholders with significant stakes in the company to have access to the company's proxy form if they want to nominate directors to the board. If you are going to try to keep the board honest, you ought to have access to proxies. Now it is next to impossible for people to get. Third, it requires boards of directors to receive a majority of the vote in uncontested elections in order to remain on the board. It makes no sense for board members to be reelected if the majority of shareholders casting ballots vote against them. Fourth, it eliminates staggered boards which insulate board members from the consequences of their decisions by requiring all directors to face election annually. Fifth, it requires public companies to split the jobs of CEO and chairman of the board and requires the chairman to be an independent director. That one has gotten the most pushback from the corporate world. That surprised me, but that is the facts. And, sixth, and finally, requires public companies to create a separate risk committee containing all independent directors to assess the risks that the company is undertaking. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Senator Corker.","Speech"," "

"Chairman Reed","Thank you. Now let me introduce our witnesses. Our first is Ms. Meredith B. Cross, the Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Prior to joining the staff in June 2009, Ms. Cross was a partner at Wilmer, Cutler, Pickering, Hale & Dorr in Washington, DC, where she advised clients on corporate and securities matters, was involved with the full range of issues faced by public and private companies in capital raising and financial reporting. Prior to joining Wilmer Hale, Ms. Cross worked at the SEC from 1990 to 1998 in various capacities, including chief counsel and deputy director of the division she now leads. Our next witness is Professor John C. Coates. Professor Coates is the John F. Cogan, Jr. Professor of Law and Economics at Harvard Law School. He joined the faculty in 1997 after practicing at the New York law firm of Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz where he was a partner specializing in mergers and acquisitions, corporate and securities law, and the regulation of financial institutions. He is a member of the Legal Advisory Committee of the New York Stock Exchange, and he is the author of a number of articles on corporate, securities, and financial institution law and for 7 years coauthored the leading annual survey of development and financial institution M&A. Our next witness is Ms. Ann Yerger. She is the Executive Director of the Council of Institutional Investors, an organization of public, corporate, and Taft-Hartley pension funds. Ms. Yerger joined the council in early 1996 as the Director of the Council's Research Service before being named Executive Director in January 2005. Her prior experiences include work at the Investor Responsibility Research Center and Wachovia Bank. Our next witness is Mr. John J. Castellani. Mr. Castellani is the President of the Business Roundtable, an association of chief executive officers of U.S. companies. Mr. Castellani joined the Business Roundtable in May 2001 and had led the group's efforts on public policy issues ranging from trade expansion to civil justice reform to fiscal policy. Prior to becoming President of the Business Roundtable, Mr. Castellani was Executive Vice President of Tenneco, Incorporated. Our next witness is Professor J.W. Verret. Professor Verret is an Assistant Professor of Law at George Mason University School of Law. He has written extensively on corporate law topics, including a recent paper cowritten with Chief Justice Myron T. Steele of the Delaware Supreme Court.

"Ms. Cross","Good afternoon, Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and Members of the Subcommittee. My name is Meredith Cross, and I am Director of the Division of Corporation Finance at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. As you noted, I just rejoined the SEC staff in June of this year after more than 10 years in private practice here in Washington. I worked at the SEC for most of the 1990s, and I am delighted to be back at the agency at this critical time in the regulation of our financial markets. I am pleased to testify on behalf of the Commission today on the topics of corporate governance and the agency's ongoing efforts to assure that investors have the information they need to make informed voting and investment decisions. Good corporate governance is essential to investor confidence in the markets, and it cannot exist without transparency--that is, timely and complete disclosure of material information. In responding to the market crisis and erosion of investor confidence, the Commission has identified and taken steps over the past months in a number of significant areas where the Commission believes enhanced disclosure standards and other rule changes may further address the concerns of the investing public. Two months ago, the Commission voted to approve proposals designed to help shareholders more effectively exercise their State law right to nominate directors. Under the proposals, shareholders who otherwise have the right to nominate directors at a shareholder meeting would, subject to certain conditions, be able to include a limited number of nominees in the company proxy materials that are sent to all shareholders whose votes are being solicited. Shareholders also would have an expanded ability to include in company proxy materials shareholder proposals addressing this important topic. In addition, the Commission recently proposed amendments to its proxy rules to enhance the disclosure that is provided to shareholders in company proxy statements, a key document in shareholders' voting decisions on the election of directors. Under the proposals, shareholders would receive expanded information about the qualifications of directors and director candidates, the board's leadership structure and role in risk management, and potential conflicts of interest of compensation consultants, in addition to enhanced disclosure concerning the company's compensation policies and whether they create incentives for employees to act in a way that creates risks that are not aligned with the company's objectives. The proposal also would improve the reporting of annual stock and option awards to company executives and directors and would require quicker reporting of shareholder vote results. The Commission also recently proposed amendments to the proxy rules to clarify the requirements consistent with the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2009 for a ``say-on- pay'' vote at public companies that have received and not repaid financial assistance under the TARP and approved changes to the New York Stock Exchange rules to prohibit brokers from voting shares held in street name in director elections unless they have received specific voting instructions from their customers. Finally, the Commission has asked the staff to undertake this year a comprehensive review of other potential improvements to the proxy voting system and shareholder communications rules. The Commission looks forward to hearing from the public on the outstanding proposals and to carefully considering all views in moving forward over the coming months. Thank you again for inviting me to appear before you today and for the Subcommittee's support of the agency in its efforts at this critical time for our Nation's investors. The Commission will remain vigilant in its efforts to support strong corporate governance and disclosure practices and also stands ready to lend whatever assistance it can to the work that is going on outside the agency on these important topics. I would be happy to answer any questions you may have.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MEREDITH B. CROSS, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF CORPORATION FINANCE, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"

"Mr. Coates","Thank you, Senator Reed, thank you, Ranking Member Bunning, and the rest of the Members of the Committee who are. I very much appreciate the opportunity to talk about corporate governance. Good corporate governance is an essential foundation to economic growth, and so this could not be a more important time for the Congress to be focusing on it. There are a large number of reforms--six in Senator Schumer's bill alone, and there are many others--that we could talk about. I am going to talk about a few. I am happy to talk about others that you may have questions about or want to explore. But before I talk about specifics, let me make two general remarks that I think should be kept in mind in thinking about any particular reform. First, and maybe a little controversially, I think it is fair to say that the academic perspective on corporate governance would view financial firms differently than other kinds of corporations, and not in the straightforward way that you might think; that is to say, shareholders of financial firms want financial firms to take risk and want them to take more risk than may be appropriate from the perspective of the taxpayer. That is because many of the large financial institutions are, as we have learned, too big, too complex to fail, so that from the shareholders' perspective, if things go well with the risks that the companies take, they are on the upside; and if things go badly, then in the end it is the taxpayer who helps defray the costs to the shareholders. As a result of that, I do not think that it would be a good idea to give shareholders considerably more power in the governance of large financial institutions. I think, in fact, if anything, financial regulators should be given more authority to check the power that shareholders have, at least on particular issues--compensation being one. The compensation structures and incentives that shareholders, even if the boards are doing exactly the right thing for shareholder, that shareholders want of large banks are not the ones that are going to be the most safe and most sound from the perspective of the American public. So that is the first general remark. Second is across the board on this, I think it is fair to say that academic and scientific research more generally is quite weak. It is evolving. There is almost no nontrivial issue in corporate governance about which there is not fierce academic as well as political argument. That cautions against passing rules that are fixed, mandatory, and are hard to change over time. Instead, it cautions for giving shareholders the ability to adopt rules for their own companies, facilitating collective action by them--and that is an important role, I think, that regulation can play. Shareholders of public companies are dispersed, cannot easily act on their own, and often face entrenched boards who are unwilling to make changes when they are, in fact, the best thing for the companies. The caution about the weakness of the scientific evidence is also not a reason to do nothing because what I just said is one thing that there is general consensus on. Disperse shareholders have a hard time acting for themselves as the number of shareholders increase. And the other general consensus, I would say, across the board is that corporate governance in the United States in the last 10 to 20 years has not performed terribly well at a large number of companies. And so there is need for change, and there is need for carefully considered moderate reforms of a kind that can be revised over time as learning on these subjects grows. So on the specifics, let me say quickly, I think the evidence that we do have is that ``say-on-pay'' is a good idea, and I am happy to expound on that beyond that bottom-line conclusion. I would say for large companies, splitting CEOs from chairmen has some evidence behind it that that is a good thing. Smaller companies, I am not so sure the evidence is there. But as long as the SEC is given appropriate authority to tailor any legislation in this area, I think that would be a good thing to pursue. I would say that staggered boards, the evidence, if anything, runs against eliminating them. They are an important option between, on the one hand, a fully contestable corporate governance structure where every director is up for election every year, and a governance structure where essentially the insiders have complete control, as in the case of Google, which is a reasonably successful company. In between, staggered boards have proven to be a type of governance structure that investors and new IPOs have been willing to put their money behind, and to ban them across the board I don't think is supported by the evidence at the moment. On shareholder access, just to wrap up, frankly there is no evidence, and I think there is--that is a reason to proceed, but to proceed cautiously, to proceed through the SEC, and here I think the SEC already has adequate authority to pursue this topic. But the one thing Congress probably could clarify is exactly what their authority is in this area, and I think that would be a good thing. With that, thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN C.

"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Professor Coates.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Good afternoon. Thank you very much for the opportunity to share the council's views on the very important issues under consideration today. By way of introduction, council members are responsible for safeguarding assets used to fund the retirement of millions of individuals throughout the United States. They are capitalists, responsible for an aggregate portfolio of somewhere north of $3 trillion in assets. They have a very significant commitment to the domestic markets, on average investing about 60 percent of their portfolios in stocks and bonds of U.S. public companies. And they are long-term, patient investors due to their long investment horizons and their very heavy commitment to passive investment strategies. Council members have been very deeply impacted by the financial crisis, and they have a vested interest in ensuring that the gaps and shortcomings exposed by this crisis are repaired. Clearly, a review and restructuring of the U.S. financial regulatory model are necessary steps toward restoring investor confidence and protecting against a repeat of these failures. But regulatory reform alone is insufficient. Corporate governance failures also contributed to this crisis, and as a result, governance reforms are an essential piece of the reform puzzle. Failures of board oversight, of enterprise risk, and executive pay were clear contributors to this crisis. In particular, far too many boards structured and approved executive pay programs that motivated excessive risk-taking and paid huge rewards, often with little or no downside risk, for short-term results. Current corporate governance rules also failed by denying owners of U.S. companies the most basic rights to hold directors accountable. The council believes governance reforms in four areas are essential, and, Senator Schumer, they will be familiar to you. First, Congress should mandate majority voting for directors of all U.S. public companies. It is a national disgrace that under most State laws the default standard for uncontested director elections is a plurality vote, which means that a director is elected even if a majority of the shares are withheld from the nominee. The corporate law community has taken baby steps to accommodate majority voting, and some companies have volunteered to adopt majority voting, but sometimes only when pressured by shareowners. But while many of the largest U.S. companies have adopted majority voting, plurality voting still dominates at small and midsized U.S. companies. This is a fundamental flaw in our governance model. Given the failure by the States, particularly Delaware, to lead this reform, the council believes that the U.S. Congress must legislate this important and most basic shareowner right. Second, Congress should affirm the SEC's authority to promulgate rules allowing owners to place their director nominees on management's proxy card. The council believes a modest proxy access mechanism would substantially contribute to the health of our U.S. governance model by making boards more responsive to shareowners, more thoughtful about whom they nominate, and more vigilant about their oversight responsibilities. The council commends the SEC for its leadership on this important reform, but, unfortunately, the SEC may face unnecessary, costly, and time-consuming litigation in response to any approved access mechanism. To ensure that owners of U.S. companies face no needless delays over the effective date of this critical reform, the council recommends congressional affirmation of the SEC's authority. Third, Congress should pass legislation mandating annual advisory votes on executive pay, explore strengthening clawback standards, and support the SEC's efforts to enhance executive pay disclosures. Council members have a vested interest in ensuring that U.S. companies attract, retain, and motivate the highest- performing employees and executives. But as highlighted by this crisis, they are harmed when poorly structured pay programs reward go-for-broke, short-term performance that ultimately harms the company's long term. The council believes executive pay issues are best addressed by: first, requiring companies to provide full disclosure of key elements of pay; second, ensuring that directors can be held accountable for their pay decisions through majority voting and access mechanisms; third, by giving shareowners oversight of executive pay via annual nonbinding votes; and, fourth, by requiring disgorgement of ill-gotten gains. One technical suggestion. We recommend that legislation mandating annual advisory votes stipulate that these are a nonroutine matter for purposes of New York Stock Exchange Rule Fourth, Congress should mandate that all corporate boards be chaired by an independent director. The council believes separating these positions appropriately reflects differences in the roles, provides a better balance of power between the CEO and the board, and facilitates strong, independent board leadership and functioning. In closing, empirical evidence from around the globe supports these reforms. The experiences in other countries and, where applicable, here in the United States are powerful evidence that these reforms are not harmful to the markets and, of note, these measures do not reward short-termism. On the contrary, they are tools to enable owners to think and act for the long term. Thank you for your consideration of these important issues, and I look forward to answering any questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF ANN YERGER, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR, COUNCIL OF INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS"
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Ms. Yerger.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Thank you. Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bunning, Members of the Committee. I am John Castellani, President of the Business Roundtable. The Business Roundtable has long been at the forefront of efforts to improve corporate governance. We have, in fact, been issuing best practice statements in this area for more than three decades. All of those best practice statements are driven by one principle: To further U.S. companies' ability to create jobs, product service benefits, and shareholder value that improve the well-being of all Americans. At the outset, I must respectfully take issue with the premise that the most significant cause of the current financial crisis was problems in corporate governance. The financial crisis likely stemmed from a variety of complex factors, including failures of the regulatory system, over- leveraged financial markets, a real estate bubble, as well as failures in risk management. The recently established Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission is just starting its work, and any attempt to make policy in response to the purported causes would seem premature. In fact, to do so could well exacerbate factors that may have contributed to the crisis, such as the emphasis on short-term gains at the expense of long-term sustainable growth. Moreover, the problems giving rise to the financial crisis occurred at a specific group of companies, financial institutions. Responding by enacting a one-size-fits-all corporate governance regime applicable to all 12,000 publicly traded companies really does not make much sense. This approach fails to consider a number of factors that I would like to spend the remainder of my time this afternoon discussing. First, there has been sweeping transformation of corporate governance practices in the past 6 years, many of which have been proactively adopted by companies. For example, the average board independence of S&P 1500 companies increased from 69 percent in 2003 to 78 percent in 2008. That same group of companies that have a separate chairman of the board increased from 30 percent in 2003 to 46 percent in 2008. Many companies have appointed an independent lead or presiding director who, among other things, presides over executive sessions of the independent directors. Companies have adopted majority voting standards for the election of directors. In fact, more than 70 percent of the S&P 500 companies have done so. And many companies have moved to the annual election of directors. Second, applying a single one-size-fits-all approach to corporate governance regardless of a company's size, shareholder base, and other circumstances simply will not work. While there is a multitude of guidance about best practices in corporate governance, each company must periodically assess the practices that will best enable it to operate most effectively to create long-term shareholder value. In this regard, we share the concerns recently expressed by New Jersey Investment Council in the letter to SEC Chairman Schapiro, that it is, quote, ``troubled by the proliferation of rigid, prescriptive responses which are costly, time consuming, unresponsive to individual fact settings surrounding specific companies and industries, and which may correlate only randomly with the creation of shareholder value.'' Third, for more than 200 years, State corporate law has been the bedrock upon which the modern business corporation has been created and has thrived. It remains the most appropriate and effective source of corporate governance. In large part, this stems from the flexibility provided by its enabling nature and by its responsiveness in adjusting to current developments. The amendments to Delaware and other States' laws over the past several years have facilitated majority voting and director elections, and the very recent amendments in Delaware law to facilitate proxy access and proxy reimbursement bylaws are examples of this responsiveness and flexibility. Fourth, to the extent that shareholders desire change in a particular company's corporate governance, many avenues are available to them to make their views known and for companies to respond. For example, shareholders may seek to have their proposals included in company proxy statements. In recent years, many companies have responded to these proposals by adopting significant corporate governance changes, including majority voting for directors, special meetings called by shareholders, and the elimination of super-majority voting requirements. Recently, some companies have implemented an advisory vote on compensation, so-called ``say-on-pay,'' in response to shareholder proposals. Shareholders often engage in withhold campaigns against particular directors. And further, shareholders can engage in proxy contests to elect their director nominees to a company's board. Finally, the SEC has an important role in seeing that shareholders receive the disclosures that they need to make informed decisions. In this regard, the SEC has issued a number of corporate governance-related proposals that are aimed at improving disclosure about director experience, board leadership structure, oversight of risk management, executive compensation, and potential conflicts of interest with compensation consultants. The Business Roundtable generally supports those. Another more controversial SEC proposal seeks to amend the proxy rules to permit shareholders to nominate directors in a company's proxy materials. We have serious concerns with this proposal, and we will share those concerns with the SEC in our comments. But briefly, we believe that the adoption of this proposal could promote short-termism, deter qualified directors from serving on corporate boards, and lead to the election of special interest directors, increase the influence of the proxy advisory services, and highlight voting integrity problems in the system. In closing, let me emphasize the Roundtable's commitment to effective governance practices and enabling U.S. companies to compete globally, create jobs, and generate economic growth. However, we must be careful that in a zeal to address our current financial crisis, we do not adopt a one-size-fits-all approach that can undermine the stability of boards of directors and place companies under even greater pressure for short-term performance. We must be cautious that we don't jeopardize the engine of American wealth and prosperity. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JOHN J. CASTELLANI, PRESIDENT, BUSINESS ROUNDTABLE"
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Castellani. Professor Verret, please.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Chairman Reed, Ranking Member Bunning, and distinguished Members of the Committee, I appreciate the opportunity to testify in this forum today. My name is J.W. Verret. I teach corporate law at George Mason Law School. I am a Senior Scholar with the Mercatus Center Financial Markets Working Group, and I also run the Corporate federalism Initiative, a network of scholars dedicated to studying the intersection of State and Federal authority in corporate governance. I will begin by addressing proxy access and executive compensation rules under consideration, neither of which address the current financial crisis and both of which may result in significant unintended consequences. Then I will close with a list of factors that did contribute to the present financial crisis. I am concerned that some of the corporate governance proposals recently advanced impede shareholder voice in corporate elections. This is because they leave no room for investors to design corporate governance structures appropriate for their particular circumstances and particular companies. Rather than expanding shareholder choice, the proxy reform and ``say-on-pay'' proposals before this committee actually stand in the way of shareholder choice. Most importantly, they do not permit a majority of shareholders to reject the Federal approach. The Director of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters said it best. Quote, ``We think less is more. Fewer votes and less often would allow us to put more resources toward intelligent analysis.'' The Brotherhood of Carpenters opposes the current proposal out of concern about compliance costs. The proposals at issue today ignore their concerns, as well as concerns of many other investors. Consider why one might limit shareholders from considering alternative means of shareholder access. It can only be because a majority of shareholders at many companies might reject the Federal approach if given the opportunity. Not all shareholders share the same goals. Public pension funds run by State elected officials and union pension funds are among the most vocal proponents of the proposals before this committee. There are many examples where they used their power, their existing shareholder power, toward their own special interests. Main Street investors deserve the right to determine whether they want the politics of unions and State pension funds to take place in their 401(k)s. The current proposals also envision more disclosure about compensation consultants. Such a discussion would be incomplete without mentioning conflicts faced by proxy advisory firms like RiskMetrics, an issue the current proposals have failed to address. In addition, I will note that there is no evidence that executive compensation played a role in the current crisis. If executive compensation were to blame for the present crisis, we would see significant difference between compensation policies at those companies that recently returned their TARP money and those needing additional capital. We do not. Many of the current proposals also seek to undermine and take legislative credit for efforts currently underway at the State level and in negotiations between investors and boards. This is true on proxy access, the subject of recent rule making at the State level, and it is true for Federal proposals on staggered boards, majority voting, and independent chairmen. We have run this experiment before. The Sarbanes-Oxley Act passed in 2002 was an unprecedented shift in corporate governance, designed to prevent poor management practices. Between 2002, when Sarbanes-Oxley was passed, and 2008, the managerial decisions that led to the current crisis were in full swing. I won't argue that Sarbanes-Oxley caused the crisis, but this does suggest that corporate governance reform at the Federal level does a poor job of preventing crisis. And yet the financial crisis of 2008 must have a cause. I commend this Committee's determination to undercover it, but challenge whether corporate governance is, in fact, the culprit. Let me suggest six alternative contributing factors for this Committee to investigate. One, the moral hazard problems created by the prospect of Government bailout. Two, the market distortions caused by subsidization of the housing market through Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal tax policy. Three, regulatory failure by the banking regulators and the SEC in setting appropriate risk-based capital reserve requirements for investment in commercial banks. Four, short-term thinking on Wall Street, fed by institutional investor fixation on firms making and meeting quarterly earnings predictions. Five, a failure of credit-rating agencies to provide meaningful analysis caused by an oligopoly in the credit-rating market supported by regulation. Six, excessive write-downs in asset values under mark-to- market accounting, demanded by accounting firms who refuse to sign off on balance sheets out of concern about exposure to excessive litigation risk. Corporate governance is the foundation of American capital markets. Shifting that foundation requires deliberation and a respect for the roles of States in corporate governance. Eroding that foundation risks devastating effects for capital markets. Thank you for the opportunity to testify and I look forward to answering your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF J.W. VERRET, ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF LAW, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW"
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Professor. Mr. Ferlauto, please.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Good afternoon, Chairman Reed and Members of the Committee. My name is Rich Ferlauto. I am Director of Corporate Governance and Pension Investment for AFSCME, the public employee union. Our union has a long-term abiding interest in the health of the capital markets. Our 1.6 million members are invested through public pension systems that have assets over $1 trillion. They depend on those assets for long-term retirement security. Those public pension systems have got time horizons of 20 to 30 years in which they need to pay out our member benefits so that we are a long-time, long-term investor with those types of time horizons. I might also mention that AFSCME and the AFSCME Pension Fund early on sued AIG over proxy access rights because we understood that the board had failed to do the type of risk disclosure that we felt was necessary and part of the responsibility of directors. I am also Chairman of Shareowners.org, a new nonprofit, nonpartisan social networking organization designed to give voice to retail shareholders who rarely have opportunities to communicate with regulators, policy makers, and companies in which they are invested. I am here today to urge your focus on corporate governance. We believe that corporate governance reform is essential to good performing capital markets, and, in fact, with greater corporate governance and shareholder rights, we could have avoided some of the $11 trillion in asset loss that was faced and felt dearly by our members and certainly the U.S. households. According to a recent public opinion survey by the Opinion Research Corporation conducted for Shareowners, investors want to see Congress take strong action to fix financial markets and to clean up Wall Street. Such action, we believe, is essential in order for you to rebuild confidence in the markets. Capital markets will not work without investors. Investors will not come back if they don't have confidence that the markets are running appropriately. Support for such action is strong across all age, income, and educational and political affiliations. Thirty-four percent of the investors that we surveyed used the term ``angry'' to describe their views. The number one reason for the loss of investor confidence in the market, we found, were ``overpaid CEOs and/or unresponsive management and boards'' at 81 percent. Six out of ten investors said that strong Federal action would help restore their confidence in the fairness of the markets. When we queried them about policy preferences, the survey found that four out of five American investors agreed that shareholders should be permitted to be actively involved in CEO pay. Eighty-two percent agreed that shareholders should have the ability to nominate and elect directors. And 87 percent of investors who lose their retirement savings to fraud and abuse should have the right to go to court to reclaim that money. Fully consistent with these findings, we think that the Committee should focus on fixing corporate governance. The core to fixing corporate governance is to focus on the directors and the responsibility between asset owners and their agents, directors on corporate boards. The most critical change to do that is to create a proxy access right so that shareholders, particularly long-term shareholders who own patient capital in the markets, so that they may cost effectively nominate candidates for election to boards. We are very encouraged that the SEC is in the process of rule making on this issue but also believe that this is such an important right that it should not become a political football for future commissions. There needs to be long-term consistency in securities laws and the Exchange Act is the appropriate place to clearly codify the authority that the Commission has to require disclosure of nominees running for board seats. Proxy access is fundamental to free and fair election for directors. Second, shareholders should have a right to ``say-on-pay,'' a vote on the appropriateness of CEO compensation. We are excited that we saw the vote in the House the other day, expect to see a full vote this week, and as Ann Yerger from CII said, we think it is absolutely essential that broker votes not be included in the total so that a change to 452, excluding broker votes on ``say-on-pay,'' would be a tremendous enhancement to see on the Senate side. I could make other comments, but let me wrap up by saying we thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to testify today. Rebuilding investor confidence in the market depends on thoughtful policymaking that expands investor rights and authorizes the SEC to strengthen its advocacy role on behalf of all Americans and their financial security. I would be happy to answer any questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RICHARD C. FERLAUTO, DIRECTOR OF CORPORATE GOVERNANCE AND PENSION INVESTMENT, AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE, COUNTY, AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES"
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Ferlauto. Let us do a 6-minute initial round with the intention of doing a second round so we can quickly get everyone to ask some questions. We are extremely fortunate your testimony collectively and individually has, I think, advanced this argument and debate significantly. Ms. Cross, one of the issues here that has been alluded to by Professor Verret and others is the interaction between the SEC and States, primarily Delaware, since they have 70 percent of the public corporations. Can you comment upon this? In fact, I think I noted in your proposed rules that they are subject to the State corporate law, is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","That is correct. Under the access proposal, you would have a right of access to include nominees in an SEC proxy--SEC-filed proxy only if you have a State law right to nominate directors. So we start with the State law and then we enable shareholders to exercise their State law rights through the Federal proxy rules.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","That raises the issue, really, of since the proxy rules are Federal rules and not required by any States, I don't think, I think this is a principal sort of issue between whether or not there should be the ability of the SEC to require these rules even if the State doesn't. Is that something that you can't do now under present law or you choose not to do?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","That is a good question. Under State law now, recent changes in Delaware include an ability for shareholders to decide to vote to require the proxy access. We have authority under our current rules, under the 34 Act, to also require companies to include nominees in their proxy statement and we believe these do coexist. The way we have done our proposal assures that shareholders would have immediate access to the proxy to nominate their holders if they satisfy our requirements. They still could vote under State law to have--to relax the standard so that more shareholders can do so.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Professor Verret, I think you are interested in this topic. Your comments?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Mr. Chairman, I would only offer that the SEC's proposal does include references to State law, but specifically, the SEC's proposal says, sure, you can adopt a bylaw that would describe how proxy access will work only if it complies with the SEC's mandate. So it is very clear on that. It runs roughshod, I think, over State corporation law determining election rights, and so I think it expressly--you might find references in there to State law, but the references are intended to make clear that the SEC determines how proxy access is going to work and if there is any--you can certainly make up your own rules, only if they comply completely with the SEC's rules on this essentially State corporate law matter.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Well, there are State corporate laws, but I think you recognize that the proxy process is a result primarily of Federal laws.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, the proxy process, sure, and the proxy process was intended mostly about issues of disclosure. And I would offer a quote from Justice Powell in CPS v. Dynamics. You don't have to listen to me. Take Justice Powell's word for it. No principle of corporate law is more firmly established than a State's authority to regulate domestic corporations, including the voting rights of shareholders. So Justice Powell, at least, is with me on that one.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Do you agree with all of his opinions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, no. No. I wouldn't say that.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","But I like that one.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Let me shift to Professor Coates and Mr. Castellani. You have described--in fact, you might comment on this issue, too, Professor Coates, and then I have another question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","I think it is, as I said in my opening remarks, I think that if Congress were not to act, the SEC were to adopt proxy access, it is almost certainly the case that someone will challenge their authority to do so precisely along the lines that Professor Verret has suggested. I think that challenge will lose because I think the proposal is about communication. It is allowing shareholders to exercise rights that they clearly do have under State law. The SEC's proposal would allow, contrary to what was suggested earlier, any State to change its law and make it clear that shareholders would not have the right to nominate directors in this fashion and then the SEC's rules would not override that State law decision. So the proposal, at least the way I read it and the way I believe that a court would read it, would not, in fact, conflict with State law on this issue.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Let me follow up on one of the comments you made in your statement, and that is that we assume, I think, that--at least there is a general assumption that shareholder participation the way we describe would enhance the performance of the company. But you suggest in certain situations, financial institutions, for example, that it could have perverse effects. It seems to me that there are three or four different decisions here. You can pay dividends. You can pay the executives instead of paying dividends. Or you can reinvest and increase shareholder value, et cetera. The shareholders, I think, would be interested in dividends and maybe also, second, long-term value, but less interested in compensation for executives. But that is just a sort of prelude to the question of what are the--what specific disincentives do you see if shareholders can vote like this?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","I mean, there has been a longstanding economic theory about which there is a fair amount of evidence that suggests that in a company's capital structure, there are conflicts between the shareholders who are entitled to all upside beyond the fixed payments that creditors are entitled to and the creditors. The U.S. Government, because it insures the deposits of all the banks that it insures, which is most of them, is fundamentally a creditor of the large banking institutions, and so there is, in fact, going to be on many occasions a conflict of interest between shareholder interests and the interest of the taxpayer with respect to insured depository institutions. That is the fundamental conflict. And to the extent that the proposals go toward increasing shareholder power, that simply makes the bank regulators' jobs in restraining risk taking by those banks at the behest of shareholders and boards who are seeking to maximize share value, even if it is long-term share value, that much harder. So any effort in this area, I submit, should be accompanied by clear authority for the banking regulators to at least moderate the way these things play out for banking institutions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you. My time has expired.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","And we will do a second round.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Professor Verret, if we are going to make proxy access easier for shareholders, what restrictions would you recommend to make sure that the SS benefit a majority of shareholders and the long-term value of the company and does not just benefit small groups of investors and lead to short-term profits?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, Senator Bunning, I would offer that the best person to make--the best group to make that assessment is the shareholders themselves. And so I would leave it to shareholders to determine how proxy access should work, how it should operate. And so for that reason, I think the innovations at the level of Delaware and in the Model Business Code, which forms the basis for 20 to 30 other corporate law codes of other States, are on the right track. And I think also Commissioner Paredes has offered a proposal to the SEC to help buttress this development, to permit access for shareholder election bylaws to the corporate ballot. So in other words, instead of saying this is how the elections should work, we say shareholders can put forward a bylaw that should say how the election should work. All the shareholders should determine how that election should work. In many ways, it is similar to the Constitutional Convention. Rather than choosing--the people got to choose the mechanism by----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You are not suggesting we go back to a Constitutional Convention----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","No, no, but----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Not now.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","But in effect, a ratification of a shareholder election bylaw is kind of like a Constitutional Convention for shareholders. I think that is an apt analogy.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Professor Coates, in your written testimony--written--you raised an interesting idea. Rather than forcing a structure on all companies, you suggested an opt out vote by shareholders every few years for some governance proposals. That idea could be applied to proxy access and advisory vote procedures as well, instead of Government deciding what the rules will be. I want to know what each of you think of that approach, of a mandatory opt in or opt out vote every few years to decide certain matters. Let us start with you, Professor Coates. Since you seem to have expressed this idea, now I would like to hear your comments on it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Sure. Thank you for the--obviously, I like my idea, but----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, I hope so.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","----to explain, I don't think of it as necessary to prevent imposing Government regulation, because I don't think that is actually the intent of any of the proposals that are currently being debated. I do think it would be a good idea to preserve flexibility in what sorts of corporate governance structures companies are either required or induced to adopt, and one way to achieve that is to let shareholders, who, after all, this is meant to be in the interest of shareholders, so if shareholders every 5 years are given the option of rejecting a particular idea on the ground that it is too expensive, for example, too cumbersome, or simply inapt for their company, and here I would join Professor Verret in saying I think that is a reasonable approach. The key point, though, is it needs to be opt out, because as I alluded to in my opening remarks, shareholders on their own, despite the 20, 30 years of efforts by organizations like the one led by Ms. Yerger, have had a very hard time getting companies to be responsive. It has been 20 years since proxy access has been proposed by leading institutional shareholders and only now is it being taken seriously. So I have to, with all due respect, disagree with the Business Roundtable's suggestion that, in fact, corporate boards are generally responsive to shareholder desires. Start with a good rule----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Ms. Cross.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Sorry.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","Thank you, sir. It is an interesting idea and I think with respect to our proxy access proposal, which is the one that we have on the table right now, we include requests for comment in our proposal about whether or not you should be able to opt out and have the shareholders choose a different access mechanism, and we very much look forward to receiving comments on that. This is a proposal as we----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","How much more time do we have?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","On the proposal?","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","No, to make suggestions or to comment.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","The comment period runs through August 16 or 17, I believe.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","I have a couple of observations. First of all, I am not a lawyer, so I come at this from a different perspective----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Good. I am very happy to hear that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Our belief is that the board of directors is the cornerstone of the corporate governance model and the primary rights assigned to owners, aside from buying and selling their shares, is to elect and remove directors. And the fact is that we do not have those tools here in the United States. And that is why we advocate majority voting and access to the proxy. We think these are two principled rules. They are applicable to all companies at all times. In terms of an opt out idea, I mean, I don't see how an opt out would be relevant at all to majority voting for directors. I mean, I just believe fundamentally that if a director does not win support of a majority of the votes cast, that director should not stand----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","----on the board. But one quick point on access. There is already a----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I have only got 35 seconds, and I have got one more question.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","OK, sorry.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That is OK. This is for Professors Coates and Verret. Several weeks ago, Professor Henry Hu raised an interesting problem before this Subcommittee. He pointed out that with derivatives, the voting rights of shares can now be separated from the economic right of the shares, setting up a situation where the person voting has no interest in the long- term health of the company. What can and should be done about that? Take a shot at it, both of you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","I have a negative 5 seconds.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, that is all right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","That is all right. OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You get to answer.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Henry's issue is a serious one. It is one that has affected a number of companies in the past--in the recent years during the financial turmoil because it allows hedge funds' short-term speculators who have distinctly different interests than the long-term shareholders represented at this table----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","They can have a negative interest.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Exactly. Now, I believe that if the SEC is given time to address the issue adequately, they already understand that this is a significant problem. There are no simple fixes to this, just as there are no simple fixes to most problems in the market.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You have not made a suggestion yet.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Well, disclosure is usually the place the SEC does and should start. That is the place where I would start on addressing the problem.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Disclosure.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Yes, full disclosure of hedge fund positions.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","I would echo that disclosure is--that sunlight is the best disinfectant and that the central mission of the SEC is disclosure. And, in fact, that is part of the reason why I am opposed to the SEC's current proposal on proxy access, and it is proxy access through legislation so that it goes beyond the central mission of the SEC for disclosure.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Bunning. Senator Schumer, please.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. I thank all the witnesses. Very informative testimony. I am going to make two comments--one to Professor Verret, one to Professor Coates--to which you can comment in writing, because I do not have much time and I want to ask other questions. To Professor Verret, ``Let the shareholders decide,'' as Ms. Yerger points out, is a tautology. Shareholders do not decide now, so just saying let us leave it up to the shareholders and whatever they decide happens happens, in too many instances they just do not have the ability to decide now. Our rules are supposed to let them decide, and you are sort of proposal, well, whatever they say is what they want--not under these rules. You can respond in writing.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","To Professor Coates, this idea that financial firms, because they could be bailed out, the shareholders would have a different structure, I would like you to ask the shareholders of Citigroup or AIG, former, if they feel that they have done quite well because they have let risks go too far and they were bailed out. In other words, most companies, by the time they are bailed out, their shares are worth very, very little. And I do not think they would have a different structure, and I would argue that the recent history would undercut your argument even further, and that is, allowing risk--because you are a financial firm and you might be bailed out allows you to take risk, and that is fine for the shareholders? They are going to be very wary of risk over the next 5 years, whether they are bailed out or not, because shares went way down. You can respond in writing to that one, but I just do not think the facts, the recent history bears out that hypothesis. Response: One of the most basic and widely accepted principles of corporate finance is that shareholders--who are entitled to all of the upside if a company does well--would rather that the company take more risks than do the creditors, who are generally entitled only to receive back the principal and preset interest on their loans. See R.A. Brealey and S.C. Myers, Principles of Corporate Finance (5th ed. 1996) at 492 (``stockholders of . . . firms  gain when business risk increases. Financial managers who act strictly in their shareholders' interests (and against the interests of creditors) will favor risky projects over safe ones. They may even take risky projects with negative ''). Nothing in the recent crisis has affected that general conclusion. Higher risk generally means higher return for shareholders, but for creditors, whose return is fixed, risk-taking by corporate borrowers just increases the odds that they will not get repaid in full. Generally, creditors protect themselves against shareholders pressuring companies to take too much risk by negotiating for explicit restrictions in their contracts. For example, a bank loan may forbid a company from reducing its cash on hand below a set level, or from making large new investments without creditor approval. The U.S. Government, as back-stop creditor of all of the major commercial banks (and, as it turned out, AIG, too, even though AIG was not an insured bank), tries to protect itself against excessive risk-taking by setting capital requirements and imposing other forms of regulation on banks. Existing regulations have not proven effective, and many proposals under consideration would strengthen those regulations, and limit further the risks that banks may take with taxpayer funds. Strengthening the hand of shareholders of major banks may undercut those efforts. You are right that not all risks turn out to be good ones for shareholders, and that there are risks that turn out badly for shareholders as well as creditors, as has been the case in the recent crisis. But when the managers of large financial institutions are making decisions, they do not know how the risks will play out. Imagine a manager can choose between two investments, each to be financed partly with $5 of shareholder money and partly with a $5 loan from the creditor. One investment will pay off $5 100 percent of the time--it has no ``risk'', but it also promises no return to the shareholders, since the whole return will go to creditors. The second investment will pay off $10 90 percent of the time, and will generate a loss of $100 10 percent of the time. The second investment is clearly better for shareholders, since (in expectation) it is worth $5 90 percent of the time ($10 less the $5 loan), and -$5 10 percent of the time (loss of their $5 investment). But the second investment involves a risk to the creditors (e.g., the U.S. taxpayers) since it involves a potential loss and an inability by the company to pay back the loan, and is worse for society as a whole. Suppose the managers nevertheless choose the second investment, and it pays off badly--i.e., it generates a loss. With hindsight, shareholders have lost, too, along with the creditors. But that doesn't mean that the investment was bad for the shareholders. It is only after the loss has appeared that the investment looks bad. If they had to do all over again, most diversified shareholders generally would have the managers choose the second investment. This example is stylized, but it is no different in kind than the investment decisions that financial institution managers make every day. Corporate governance rules are changed rarely--you will be writing legislation not for the next 5 years, but for decades, through recessions and boom markets alike, and will apply to a range of publicly held companies. If the managers are forced by strong corporate governance reforms to follow more closely the directions of shareholders, they will tend, on average, to take more risks than they would if shareholder power were weaker. For most companies, creditors can take care of themselves, through contract, and in principle, as the bank regulators can offset any general increase in risk-taking by managers caused by shareholders, by requiring higher capital ratios or imposing more restrictive regulations. But the tendency of bank regulators has been, unfortunately, to fail to impose strict enough regulations to cope with the pressure of incentive compensation and other techniques for tying managers' interests to shareholder goals. General corporate governance changes of the kind being discussed should be written with that unfortunate fact in mind.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Ms. Cross, the SEC has proposed ``say-on- pay'' for TARP recipients but not for other public companies. If ``say-on-pay'' is a good idea when the Government is a shareholder, why isn't it a good idea for all shareholders?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","Chairman Schapiro has indicated that she supports ``say-on-pay'' for all public companies, and we do not have authority to require ``say-on-pay'' at public companies beyond the TARP companies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","But you would be supportive of it.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","I cannot speak for the Commission, and the Commission has not taken a position.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK. But Chairman Schapiro is supportive of it.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","Chairman Schapiro has said she supports it, and we stand ready to implement it if Congress enacts it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK, good. Mr. Castellani, you note that some of the proposals--and I think that is significant, and I appreciate that. You note that some of the proposals in the Shareholder Bill of Rights are already being adopted by your member companies and reflect an emerging consensus on best practices in corporate governance. Well, if that is the case, then what are you so afraid of? If this is the trend anyway, if you seem to indicate this is the right thing to do, what is wrong with pushing those--you know, I had a discussion with one of your members, and I will not reveal who it is, but he said, ``Look, I am not''--and then he named his predecessor. ``You do not have to legislate for me.'' I said, ``That is my whole point. We are not legislating for you. You are a good CEO, and whether your shareholders made you be a good CEO or not, you would be. But what about your predecessor?'' So, question: Doesn't the Shareholder Bill of Rights create a competitive advantage for the companies that follow the best practices? And why does the Roundtable, most of whom comply, I think overwhelmingly, with some of our proposals, and many comply with just about all of our proposals, why are they going so far to defend the outlier companies for whom the laws are needed most?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Senator, in fact, many of the Roundtable companies do and have adopted many of the practices that are in your proposal. The difference--","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","And you cite that with pride.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Yes, absolutely. The difference is those--","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","That is not a very good argument against my proposal.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Well, those who have not have made--those who have and those who have not have made the determination that that is best for their company. Their directors have made that determination, that that is best for their company under their circumstances. For example, the issue that you cited in the separation of the chairman and the chief executive officer, in some instances it makes very good sense to separate the chairman and chief executive officer, particularly where it is a transition event. But in other circumstances, boards feel that it makes best sense to have both together, but protect against the downside by having a presiding director or----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","As I mentioned--and I am----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","So the question is: Why require it?","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","I do not have much time, and I cannot stay for a second round. I am going to have to ask you another question. I understand. I mean, the one, as I said, that got the most kickback and that I am open to listening to change on or proposals on is the CEO and the independent director. You noted that 75 percent of your member organizations, 70 percent of S&P 500 companies, have adopted majority voting, and roughly half of the S&P 500s now hold annual director elections. Yet you argue that the one-size-fits-all approach simply will not work. Can you give me one good reason that a director who gets only one vote at an annual meeting should be allowed to continue as a director?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","I cannot give you any good reason why any director who does not receive a majority vote of the shareholders should be seated, unless--unless--it jeopardizes the ability of that company to be able to operate and that board to operate. For example, many companies who have adopted majority voting put in a safeguard for their companies such that if they require that particular director--that may be the only director that has the financial expertise that is required on the audit committee, the only director that would have the compensation expertise that is required on the compensation committee. If that would force the company to be in noncompliance, then what companies do is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","How about take away that exception? Any other justification? Let us assume we wrote into the law----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Not as long as the board can function and the company can function.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","OK, thanks. Well, good, we have won you over on at least two-thirds of one of our proposals.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","And, legally, Senator, I would offer that failure to seat a quorum could result in a wide variety of legal circumstances, including, for instance, it could be an event of default under the company's debt obligation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","I am sure we could deal with that, particularly with the quorum issue, in the interim until there was another election. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My time has expired.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Schumer. Senator Corker, please.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the Senator from New York, I appreciate you offering something to look at. I do want to observe the staggered board issue I think has not been universally accepted, and I think we have a body on the other side of the Capitol that does not have staggered boards, and sometimes things come out of there pretty hot, like the 90-percent tax on the AIG bonuses. So I think there is some merit in that and hope you might consider that particular piece evolving. But I want to say one other thing. Professor Coates, I know that to assume that the folks who own AIG today are the same folks who might have encouraged the risk would not be a good assumption. I mean, those guys sold out high, and the folks that are left behind--so, again, I do not think you can make that assessment. So I hope we can look at some of those things, and I look forward to really trying to work with you on something that we both might consider to be improved. We talked to Carl Icahn on the phone some time ago--I shared this with Senator Schumer--and he is obviously someone who cares a great deal about corporate governance. He has written about this, or I would not relay our conversation. It is certainly something he publicly feels. But the whole issue of where companies are incorporated seems to be an issue that is maybe even bigger than anything that has been laid out today. And I wonder if a couple of you might respond to that. Obviously, companies incorporate in States in many cases that give them many protections and keep shareholders from being able to make huge changes. And I wonder, Professor Coates and Professor Verret, if you might both respond to that, and anybody else who might have something salient.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, I am aware that Mr. Icahn has funded North Dakota's Business Incorporation Act. He hired a lawyer to write it for him, and he hopes to get companies to reincorporate to North Dakota. Having clerked for the Delaware Court of Chancery, I am a bit biased. I think Delaware is a very effective court for litigating corporate governance issues--mostly due to the intelligence and superior talent of their law clerks. But I would also offer that, to some extent, I think some of what is behind some of this effort is short-termism, some of the short- termism that got us into this problem in the first place: Let us cash out on dividends rather than invest in R&D. And sometimes hedge fund activism is very effective in long-term growth and in sort of rattling the saber a little bit and getting things moving. And sometimes hedge fund activism, though, kills companies that should continue to survive and strips them of their assets. And so I think that is part of what is behind the approach. Also, I think we----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","In essence, then, you are saying that you like some activism on behalf of shareholders, but not too much.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Absolutely, and I am a little bit suspicious of Mr. Icahn's motives, at some of his activism in activism in favor of State incorporation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","So it has been true for a long time that shareholders cannot force a reincorporation from one State to another on their own. They need the board to go along with it. And the board cannot do it on their own; it has got to be a joint decision. And as a result, there is actually relatively little movement between States once they have chosen their initial State of incorporation. At the moment before they go public, that is really the crucial decision point, and for that reason I think that fact that Delaware has a 70-percent share of the market, so to speak, it reflects well on Delaware. I think it is actually a reasonably healthy sign that Delaware is being responsive, as best it can, to balancing the interests of both shareholders and the managers that have to run them. One thing, however, I would note about Delaware and its permissiveness toward a little bit of activism is it only passed that enabling legislation in the past year, and it did it in response to the threat of Federal intervention coming from this body. And so I do not think you should think about Delaware acting on its own to help shareholders. I think you should think about Delaware acting in relationship to this body, and things that you do are going to very much impact it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Castellani, I have served on several public company boards, certainly not of the size of AIG or some of the other companies we have had troubles with. But I do not think there is any question that boards in many cases--not all, and yours, I am sure, is not this way. But it ends up being sort of a social thing. I mean, you are on the board because the CEO of this company and the CEO of that company is on the board, and, you know, it is sort of a status thing in many cases. The CEO in many cases helps select who those board members are. And most of the time these board--many of the times, these board members have their own fish to fry. They have companies that they run, they are busy with, and, for instance, a complex financial institution, there is no way, like no possible way that most board members of these institutions really understand some of the risks that are taking place. With the limited number of board meetings, even if they are on the audit committee, very difficult to do. So some of these things need to be addressed certainly by governance issues that we might address here, hopefully not too many. Some of them need to be addressed, obviously, internally at the companies. I know you have advocated that in the office. But that issue of sort of the culture of the way boards in many cases are. Not in every case. I wonder if you might have a comment there, and then add to that--I am familiar with a company that makes investments in large companies, and one of the rules they have is they do not allow the CEO himself to actually serve on the board. They report to the board. They are at the meeting. But they do not allow them to serve on the board. So I would love for you to respond to both of those inquiries.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","I think, Senator, for your first question, what you are reflecting may have been the experience when you served on the boards. But what I think it does not reflect is the tremendous change that has occurred in the boardrooms over the last 8 years. We now see boards of directors, in the case of Business Roundtable companies, that are at least 80 percent independent, and that is, the directors are independent of the company management. Indeed, the governance committees or the nominating committees that nominate the directors by requirement of the listing standards and the SEC are made up entirely of independent directors. So the nomination of a board member, a prospective board member, is no longer--if it indeed every was--controlled by the chief executive officer. And then, third, I would point out particularly the amount of time that is involved and the amount of expertise that is involved. It is not only the specific requirement of the expertise that is in the listing standards and the SEC requirements, but indeed what boards themselves are demanding and what companies and their shareholders are demanding has resulted in not only greater expertise in specific areas, but a tremendous increase in the amount of time. For example, I was recently talking to the chair of the audit committee of a large U.S. company. That chair spent 800 hours of, in this case, his time as the chair of an audit committee over the last year because of some very complex financial issues. So the board members are spending more and more time. So I would submit to you, sir, that it is very different than when you served on the boards. And in terms of the boards being able to have the CEO as a member of the board, the CEO as a member of a board, in fact, the CEO and chairman where companies choose it, is a very, very important nexus between the governance of a corporation and the management of a corporation. We have found and experience has shown over a long period of time that if you separate the governance from the management, you get precisely the kinds of problems that this Committee is trying to avoid. So having the CEO on the board is a very, very important nexus. In many cases, companies and boards believe that having the CEO as chairman of the board is also very important. Again, my point would be what I have said in my testimony: That is up to every company to decide, and their board of directors representing the shareholders to decide, rather than be prescriptive, because it is not always right, but it is always right for the company that makes the right decision, and they should be allowed to make that decision.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much, Senator Corker. Senator Menendez, please.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you all for your testimony. Let me ask you, I understand that in a previous question, most of you--I understand just one or two objections, but most of you said that you support the SEC's May 20th rule to allow certain shareholders to include their nominees and proxies that are sent to all the other shareholders. Do you think that goes far enough? Or is to too far? If you support it, I assume that it goes far enough, it is sufficient. But is there something that should be done than that? Does that embody what we want to see?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Senator Mendendez, I think it is an appropriate use of rule making, which is purely disclosure- based, which is very important; that is that it leaves up to the States the creation of rights in terms of the nomination of directors, but it empowers shareholders to be informed through shareholder communications about the fact that those elections are indeed occurring, and then votes through the proxy materials on that right. So I think that is a good balance. In addition, something that we have not talked about, the rule goes further, and it empowers shareholders to make binding bylaw amendments to improve those shareholder rights for the election of directors so that this disclosure right at 1 percent--or actually it is a tiered system that they have in the disclosure rule right now for comment--becomes a floor of disclosure, and then at the State level, through an election system based on a shareholder proposal or a board proposal, they can increase or tweak that right in an interesting way. For example, I talked about ShareOwners.org being interested in retail shareholders. They can never hope to get 1 percent. But as in the U.K., you might be able to get 100 shareholders, retail shareholders, each owning $5,000 or $10,000 worth together who might be an appropriate group to create different types of rights. So that there is flexibility, which I think is quite welcome.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Senator Menendez, I would offer that Commissioner Paredes of the SEC has offered a competing proposal to the Chairman's proposal, and I think Commissioner Paredes' proposal is much more reasonable in that it considers facilitation of State law rights rather than running roughshod over them and sort of keeping the lion's share of the meat and leaving the table scraps for the States. And I think Commissioner Paredes' proposal also strikes a balance in limiting the ability of special interests to hijack the corporate ballot. And so I would offer that for this Committee's attention.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Does anyone else have any opinion on it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Yes, Senator, I was not one of the majority who supported that, and I just wanted to make sure that you knew that. Our concern is that what the SEC is proposing to give access to the shareholders does preempt what has been traditionally done in the States. And, quite frankly, we think that there is symmetry in the argument that says if we trust the shareholders to elect the boards of directors, which we do implicitly, then we ought to trust the shareholders to set the threshold at which shareholders can nominate those board of directors candidates.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","I would just note that, as I said earlier, we think this is a core right that should be federalized. The States have failed investors too long, Delaware in particular, and it really only acted when it had to. And I think it is important that the SEC take action on this important reform.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Let me ask in a different context. In practice, a corporation serves multiple masters, right? It has shareholders, it has corporate management, its creditors, the public in general. There are many cases where what is best for corporate management may not necessarily be the best for shareholders. Or there are also cases where what is best for shareholders is not what is best for the general public or the financial institution as a whole. How do we reconcile those tensions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","That is a very interesting question that has been discussed--I am the oldest on the panel, so I can say this--for at least most of my corporate career.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","There is no one seeking to claim objection, I notice.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","I am used to it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","You have created compromise already.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","There was particularly a very important topic in the 1980s, particularly when there was as lot of activity related to hostile takeovers, and that is, to whom is a board of directors and a management responsible? And the argument was a stakeholder argument, that there were shareholders, there were employees, there were communities, there were suppliers, there were customers, all of which had a legitimate position in the decisions. I would think it is fair to say that in the 1990s and the early part of this decade, that balance switched more to the shareholders, but what happened is the nature of the shareholders has changed very, very considerably. And that is, the average holding period, for example, of a New York Stock Exchange-listed company is about 7\1/2\ months. So if your management and your board--you are really dealing with share renters and traders as much, if not more, than shareholders. And I think what we are all discussing here and we all have a perspective on is: Going forward, what is the correct balance between those who have a very, very short-term interest in very quick gain out of a company and may want to do some of the things that have been discussed here? You give access, you give rights to small percentages of shareholders. We already know in many cases how they act. Some funds come in and say, ``We own 5 percent of your company. What we want you to do is leverage the company, buy back the shares, give us about a 10-or 20-percent jump, and we are out of here, quickly.'' As opposed to other shareholders who say, ``I think there is a value-added.'' I do not know that anybody is in the long term. I do not know that any of us know the right answer to that. But I think, quite frankly, that is the question that is at the crux of what this Committee should be looking at. Obviously----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","And, Senator, I--interestingly enough for here, this is where the Business Roundtable and certainly AFSCME, and I think some members of CII agree. It is all about how you empower long-termism and long-term shareholders, which we believe that proxy access ultimately will do, so that the best interests of the company to achieve long-term shareholder value is achieved. And the way you do that, actually, in terms of this long-termism, is getting into the DNA of the board. How does the board become most effective by being diverse, by being able to absorb many different points of view, by being--to evaluate itself to make sure that it is focused on long-term strategic implementation and that CEO pay incentives are aligned with that long strategic vision? And when we see a company that fails, we see a failure in all of those areas, which is bad for the shareholders, which is bad for the employees, which is bad for management, and for all other stakeholders in the process. So we want proxy access to fix boards because they cannot self-evaluate, because they are not diverse enough to share the interests of their stakeholders, which ultimately they need in order to achieve long-term shareholder value, and because their DNA is warped enough that it only serves management or a minority of shareholders and not achieve value for the long term. And that is the very essence of why we want proxy access and we need it now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Senator, may I just also add quickly, I want to commend Senator Warner and Senator Corker for the introduction of the TARP Recipient Ownership Trust Act. Shareholders and boards are complicated enough. When Government becomes a shareholder, things become even more tricky, and I want to commend the introduction of that act as dealing with some-- going down the road to dealing with those unique conflicts.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you, Senator Menendez.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Mr. Chairman, thank you. To all the panel members, thank you very much for being here. What I am trying to figure out as I listened to this very interesting dialogue between the Senators and each of you, is this: I kind of look at this as maybe a little bit black and white. There are big players here, and there are small players here. But they are all affected by the decisions we make here. Now, Mr. Ferlauto, if I could start with you, how much money do you have under investment, say at this point in time?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","AFSCME itself is a rather small player. Our employee pension system itself has got less than $1 billion in it. But most importantly is that we are concerned about the retirement security of our members, and our members depend on well-functioning capital markets and boards to achieve value. In order for them to pay the benefits, all of our members want a market that will succeed, that has got the ability to achieve a value over time. We are not speaking and we are not active on the part necessarily of what is in our portfolio, but what is in the interests of not only our members, but all American families seeking to achieve long-term financial security. And those are the people that I speak on behalf of.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Great. Well, I have never had $1 billion under management, so I see you as a big player. What if some institution out there who has $1 billion under investment or $10 billion, or whatever--let us say they are a big player, like I think you are. Let us say you decide that you think the worst possible course of action for a company is to be pro- trade, and there are some that very openly espouse that theory, that trade has really cost jobs and hurt America and this and that. If you have access to the proxy, you then have the right to elect somebody who espouses that view. Would that be correct?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","No, not necessarily. What we have the right to do is to potentially nominate somebody, but in order for somebody to be elected, they would have to be elected by a majority of everybody who is voting, and then presumably all the owners, as in a regular election, would assert their choices based on what is in their self-interests. So that I would assume that a minority player working on any--you know, any motivated self-interest would not be able to achieve victory.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Here is what I am trying to get to, and I am not trying to be coy about this. I am trying to be very, very direct about this. I have got 100 shares; you have got $1 billion worth of shares. I am pro-trade, let us say, and whoever this institution is--I am not say AFSCME is this, but whoever this institution is, it takes a very, very different view than I do that may not be in the best interest.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","It is actually a very good point, but who I am concerned about are actually the large financial intermediaries, particularly mutual funds, who are seeking to do business, you know, with other large companies to sell their investment products through their 401(k) plans so that they actually may cast their votes in a way that would be looked kindly on by the CEO because they are not voting against his compensation plan, rather than voting in the interests of all the small individual investors who put their money into that fund, you know, thinking that that is the way to achieve value. And those are the kinds of conflicts that are rife in this system that we are very concerned about.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Yes, and I am going to be very direct again. You and I are going to have an easy time agreeing that there are a lot of ways to be self-interested. A lot of ways. So, Mr. Castellani, let me turn to you. Based on your corporate experience, what impact does that have on your company if there is, for lack of better terminology, ease of entry here?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","One of the things that we are concerned about is that it would politicize the board. The board is legally required to represent all shareholders. So each member of the board is to represent all shareholders, not a particularly constituency of shareholders. But, in fact, there are constituencies of shareholders, people who want short-term gains, people who want--you were giving an example, my company, Tenneco, owned Newport News Shipbuilding. We had a shareholder, a nice little group from Connecticut, a group of nuns who owned $2,600 of the company and wanted us to get out of the nuclear shipbuilding business. And every year, they would have that on the proxy. The point is that dissension first costs the shareholders money, because that is who pays for the proxy process. It doesn't come out of the management's pocket. It doesn't come out of the Government's pocket. The shareholders pay for the dissension. But second--directly, they pay for the proxy process--but second, boards best operate when they operate by consensus, when there is an agreement among the board of the strategic direction of the company and who should implement that strategic direction. It doesn't mean there isn't discussion. It doesn't mean there isn't questioning, that there isn't dissension. But when they make a decision, companies operate best when you don't second-guess, until there is reason to second-guess, the direction the company is going.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johnson","I am out of time, and I won't press that too much today because we have been given extra time today, but I want to offer one other thought on a totally different approach. I was on a panel yesterday in this room, and as I started my questioning, I said to the panelists, I said, I am going to warn you. I am a former Governor. It just astounds me how we have this philosophy here--and I am very new to this Senate job--it just astounds me how we think all of the best solutions are here in Washington with a Federal approach. This really does impact States in a very, very significant way. That in itself is a very, very profound issue. And yet we just kind of jump right in the middle of it with this new approach that just casts aside 50 State corporate laws. And I will share this with you. When I started as Governor many years ago, I decided that I wanted to be a State that attracted business to my State. We needed jobs and we needed economic growth in the State of Nebraska and I decided I was going to take on Delaware to try to make that happen. You know what I realized about Delaware? They had one heck of a good start and they were doing more things right than they were doing wrong and it was going to be very, very difficult to dent that. And yet in this hearing, again, whether it is Delaware or Nebraska or Wyoming or California, whoever, we have a very, very profound impact on the history of corporate governance in this Nation and I just don't think we should do that lightly. I think you would have 50 Governors in those seats back there ready to come to the table to chew on us about that, because it does have very significant consequences for the States where the jobs do exist, where the jobs are created, where hopefully the businesses grow and expand and create economic opportunities for the people out there who then pay the taxes that allow us to come here and do the social and other programs that we just love to do. So I just think it is really an important philosophical issue and that is my little sermonette at the end of the questioning. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Johanns. Let us begin the second round. Ms. Yerger, what is the status of majority voting on Delaware law now? Is it----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Under Delaware, and again, I am not a lawyer, it is not the default standard, but the laws do accommodate majority voting so companies can adopt it voluntarily.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","They can adopt it voluntarily. But under the--and Ms. Cross, under the SEC's proposal, that would not upset Delaware law if you were talking about majority voting. It would be optional.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","We don't have a proposal on majority voting. The way it would work with our proxy access is that if there were more people running than there were slots, you would usually revert to plurality voting because majority wouldn't work.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","OK. Thank you. Mr. Castellani, again, thank you for being here and for your testimony. I think the core of the issue is who knows best about the company, the directors or the shareholders. Under the present arrangement, and we have got enough lawyers who can criticize my legal analysis, is that the directors essentially control access in most companies to the proxy unless you want to mount a very expensive proxy fight. They decide in most cases and in most companies what will get on as an issue and what won't get on as an issue. So the current practice, unless we do something, will leave sort of the directors with critical control of the process and then on both sides of this argument we are talking about empowering shareholders. So your comments, and then I will open it up to the panel.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Sure. First, for the record, let me state I am a scientist and engineer, not a lawyer.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Well, Senator Bunning, again, thank you on his behalf.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","I want to say that as often as I can. In fact, the directors do not control access to the proxy for all issues. In fact, the SEC controls. Therefore, companies like Tenneco get proposals. All companies get proposals related to social issues, governance issues, economic issues, labor issues, environmental issues. But I don't think that is what you are talking about. What you are talking about is the access for the purposes of nominating directors and we have to talk about that in the context of any group of shareholders, any single shareholder has an ability, if they can afford it, and it is an expensive proposition----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","----to nominate directors and run in competition to the directors that are nominated by the Nominating Committee. That is how we do takeovers and that is how the companies make sea changes, or investors make sea changes. What I am concerned about and what we are concerned about is we have, by majority vote, by and large, directors who are elected to represent all shareholders. Those directors are, by and large, elected every year. And so if the shareholders elect the directors and the shareholders can remove the directors under majority voting, then how does the company best operate on behalf of the shareholders? Is it best operated in letting those directors make, in their collective judgment, decisions about who should be on the board representing the shareholders, who should manage the company, or do we subject those directors or a portion of them--a significant portion, 25 percent of them--to a reelection challenge every year and turn them into essentially corporate politicians, because these are contested elections. They are somehow going to have to be run as contested elections. And what does that do to the director? Does that then distract her from the business that we all want her to do, which is overseeing the shareholders' interests in that board room, or does she have to be more concerned because the conflicting nominee was elected because they didn't want us to be in the nuclear shipbuilding business, in my case, or they didn't want us to do business in a particular part of the world, or they wanted our product lines to change, or they wanted some practices to change. What our concern is is that boards should be free to do and responsible for doing what the shareholders want them to do, and that is be good stewards of their investment in the company.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Well, my sense is--and you are right to narrow down my focus to the directors' election because social issues, they do get on the board because the SEC has required that and there is an argument they could require the directors also to be subject to proxy access. But the other side of the argument is there is a group of directors that essentially nominates the Nominating Committee. Usually the Nominating Committee is directors----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Right.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","----who then choose other people they think are sympathetic to them and their views and the shareholders, unless they are not in a proxy fight, generally they either have to accept this board, and many times, as you pointed out, the board is not elected by a majority. In fact, there are many times where less than a majority of shareholders, a small number of shareholders even vote, and I think there has been a lot of discussion back and forth about motivation for voting, but most shareholders don't know--it is not the politics as practiced elsewhere. Most shareholders are reflecting on their dividends, their share value, what they think the company should be doing economically for their benefit. It is quite self-interested.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","I think, Senator, another point I should make--two other points I should make is that good boards, and certainly I would include our companies, have means by which they communicate and allow shareholders to suggest directors. And in fact, that is something that all of our member companies do now. So small groups of shareholders--and let us not kid ourselves. I mean, any management, any board that is worth anything, that can wake up and make their own breakfast in the morning, when a large shareholder comes in and says, we want to talk to you about the make-up of the board, by God, we listen, because you forget, we are in the business of trying to sell our shares to members and convince investors that we are a good company to invest in. So we listen to investors. The problem that we have is that sometimes in these discussions, you are talking about individual investors and we have to be responsive to our largest investors, which are institutional investors. And so the desires of individuals come through intermediaries, the mutual fund and the fund managers, and that message is very different than what some of the things that you are describing.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","This is a conversation that could go on at length, but I am going to stop and recognize Senator Bunning. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you very much. Professor Verret, there has been a lot of talk about giving shareholders a vote on pay packages but little discussion on the details. If we were to require such a vote, what specifically should we vote on and how often should we vote?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, notably, I think one thing I would draw out is that there is a big difference between ``say-on-pay'' and say on severance packages. I think those are two distinct issues. There is a healthy debate about both of them, but I think it is a mistake to lump them in together. I think the big difference between say on severance is that severance packages are used to facilitate efficient mergers and acquisitions. Basically, sometimes when a good M&A deal goes through, the CEO of the target has to go. It is, you have got to leave and here is some walking-away money. And those deals are great, and most of the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","But that isn't my question.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","OK. So my first answer is, I would differentiate ``say-on-pay'' and say on severance. With respect to ``say-on-pay,'' I think one of the details is how often would you approve ``say-on-pay,'' and I am aware that the United Brotherhood of Carpenters, at least, wants it every 3 years. I think some groups prefer it every----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Every 3 years?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Yes. They would prefer the pay package----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","By the time the second year came around, maybe the company would be in Chapter 11.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, perhaps, but what they propose is that typically, pay packages are negotiated over longer terms, so ``say-on-pay'' should be negotiated over the longer term. You don't necessarily reapprove the pay package every year. Sometimes they are longer term. Sometimes they are 5 or 10 years. So one of the things I would suggest is that you leave open the boards of directors and the shareholders to determine how they want ``say-on-pay'' to work.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Then you think they should be left open to the boards in negotiating with whoever they want as their CEO?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","I worry about the effects of one-size-fits-all packages, and I think we have seen that effect in Britain with their ``say-on-pay'' rules.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","And you think the negotiations on golden parachutes should be different completely?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","They should be, because sometimes you have to do them very quickly, not enough time to get approval for the package to deal with the specific merger.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Would you like to comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Very briefly. ``Say-on-pay'' is advisory votes only. There is no need for speed. There is no need for prior voting. The U.K., the Netherlands, Australia have successfully implemented this for years, and in fact, the evidence from the U.K. suggests that it almost never has a bad effect on companies, that almost all of the time, shareholders approve the pay package as presented. There are a few outliers that get their pay packages voted down and the result of that has been a better alignment of shareholder and manager interests over the past 5 years in the United Kingdom. So I think the U.K. model is working and I think it is a reasonable place to start.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Although as I am sure Professor Coates might be aware, the shareholder electorate in the United Kingdom is very different from the United States--","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","No. This is not a discussion between--we have to ask the questions.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Sorry. He is my old professor and he gave me a ``B'' in corporate law, so I have to----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","A ``B''? That is pretty good.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Unbelievable. I will give you a chance to talk again. As States respond to concerns about corporate governance issues with changes to their own laws, is there really a need to federalize business law?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","Well, I would agree, and I think we haven't even had time to see the effect of the State changes on proxy access operate after Delaware and the other States facilitated majority voting in 2006. From 2006 to 2007, we saw an increase in majority voting at companies from 20 percent of the S&P 500 to 50 percent. So Delaware just amended its code in, I think, March, and the ABA is about to change the Model Business Code. So there hasn't been enough time to see, I think, all the proxy access bylaws that I think we are going to see adopted by boards.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Ann, would you like to comment?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","I firmly believe that the problem here are the problem companies and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Yes, we know about them.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","----and that is why I believe these issues should be federalized, frankly.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Yes, but they are at the trough every time they have a problem, whether they are a finance company or whether they are an insurance company, whether they are an auto company. If you think they are too big to fail, then the Federal Government is the backstop. And if they are a GSE, we are the backstop for sure. So do you have some other suggestions that we might not have to be the backstop?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Suggestions regarding specifically--I am sorry. I have lost the question here.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You lost the question. Well, about the laws being changed in the States on corporate governance.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","I feel that majority voting, we have had plenty of experience and the fact is that there are many companies--in fact, most small companies have not adopted it. We think it is a core owner right and as a result it should be federalized. I also believe that proxy access should be federalized. The fact is, when council members invest in domestic companies, they are not doing a portfolio of Delaware companies or Nebraska companies. They are doing a portfolio of the U.S. companies, and we either make a decision that these are basic rights we should be offering to owners of any company here in the United States or not. And I think the Council firmly believes that----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","The fact that if I live in Kentucky, where I live, you want me to come in and say, the Federal Government should make the rules for every company in Kentucky.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Regarding access on majority voting----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","----yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You do.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","If I may, another----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","It won't sell.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Another approach to this which I think might sell is that give shareholders the power to decide what State they will incorporate in, and therefore you can----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, they do have the power.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","No, they don't, actually, is that right now, it is the boards through the IPO----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Oh, you mean beforehand, before they incorporate.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Maybe every 5 years. You talked about one way to do this is to give them a right every four or 5 years, similar to Mr. Coates's idea, that rather than opting in and opting out of a variety of laws, they actually have a right to decide on whether the charter and powers of a particular State are appropriate for them at a particular moment and allow shareholders to decide on their own----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You, as a billion-dollar investor, you as a person who controls $1 billion worth of investment, would say that to the shareholders after the fact, after they have already incorporated?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","I agree that there should be more--that the State of incorporation should be a greater factor when IPOs are made and that there is not enough emphasis or focus on corporate governance during the IPO process, and I think that would be something very interesting for the SEC to look at for perhaps new rule making. But if you are talking about empowering the States, one thing that you might consider to do is to give them real power and create real competition among Delaware and Nebraska and North Dakota and California and every other State by making State corporation real and let them compete. The only way you can let them compete is by giving shareholders, the owners of these companies, real power to make a decision about what laws are most appropriate to them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","It won't sell.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","It is a market-based----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","It won't sell. We can't sell it, because we would have 50 Governors up here every day trying to tell us to mind our own business.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Yes, but----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you all for your testimony, and again, both of you, for having the hearing. I think what--well, based on backgrounds, Mr. Ferlauto and I might have a difference of opinion on many things. I think what you were trying to communicate is giving shareholders--you can domicile. You can change the corporate domicile at any time you wish. It doesn't matter where you are incorporated. I actually think that Senator Johanns was referring to a race to the top and I do think that, while I realize my friend from Delaware may disagree, it actually does give shareholders the ability to influence things and I hope that we will--I am not sure it wouldn't sell and I hope it is something we will understand. I am not sure I understand enough about it myself to support it, but I do know that it certainly would give shareholders much greater freedoms. I do want to say to you, Mr. Verret, that I think you were dead on in your opening comments that here we are talking about lots of things, but really what has driven this has been moral hazard, has been what happened with GSEs, and many of the policies we put in place here, the failure of regulators, short-term thinking, credit-rating agencies that didn't do what everyone thought they were doing, and I am not sure about the mark-to-market issue. We might debate that some. But I hope that we don't go overboard with what we do here because it is other factors--many other factors--that have created this. I do, on the other hand, think that boards are the final governance issue, and if you have good boards that actually understand the risk, especially at financial institutions, I think we might actually look at differentiating things that have to do with large companies, financial companies that offer systemic risk. We may look at those a little differently. But let us get down to this risk. Senator Schumer is close to our Chairman. My guess is that just knowing how things work around here, that he may to defer to him on some of these corporate governance issues. He laid out six things. My sense is that the shareholder ``say-on-pay'' issue as advisory was not particularly controversial amongst most here, is that correct, as an advisory issue. The shareholder input didn't seem to be----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Why do it every year? Why require it for all companies?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","And maybe there is a size issue. By the way, I am not agreeing myself necessarily with all these. I am just asking you all. The independent chairperson seemed to be somewhat agreed by half and somewhat disagreed, especially Mr. Castellani, is that correct, thought that was a bad idea.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","We believe that it should be up to every board of directors and every company to decide what is best for them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Does anybody other than him disagree with what was put forth there?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","If I could note, I am not--on behalf of the SEC, I am not expressing views. The Commission hasn't expressed views on all these points.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I understand.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","By my silence, I am not commenting.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I have got you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Cross","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","We are believers in one-size-fits-all on this issue.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","You are believers in that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","The stagger board issue, I hope stays in place and is not eliminated, personally. The majority voting issue didn't seem to be a big issue to anybody here. Mr. Castellani, since you represent----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Most of our members have majority voting.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So not a big deal. So the risk committee is the one issue I think we haven't touched on----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","It is very important.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","----and I just wonder if, since I think we have got pretty good input from you all in these other areas, what are your thoughts, in whatever order you want to give them, on the risk committee issue?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Senator, if I might start, I think there probably is going to be pretty close to--well, I don't know whether we would all be unanimous. The fundamental issue, which is whether or not a board of directors should regularly and thoroughly analyze the risks that face the company and its shareholders is not one on which there is any argument. That is one of the fundamental purposes of a board of directors. What Senator Schumer in his bill prescribes, however, is not appropriate, and that is that you create a separate committee to do that. Some companies choose to do it within separate committees, but other companies think that it is better done within its audit committee because its greatest risk may be in its financial structures. Some companies do it, because of the nature of the products, in different committees because their greater risk may be either the products or the markets in which they serve as opposed to financial risk. So our suggestion is that it is done, but don't specify that you create another committee, particularly where we have already run the risk of being so prescriptive to how many committees and what type of committees boards should have that we run the risk of being the best at governance compliance and the worst at governance implementation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I understand. Is there anybody that strongly disagrees with the position he just put forth?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","Let me just add one caveat to that. I think John is right that there needs to be some flexibility, but there also needs to be some very explicit disclosure about who is responsible for risk, what committee is responsible for it, what is their charter, what powers that they have, how they will review risk, and that needs to be disclosed much more heavily than it does right now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So you would moderate the bill in that way and specify that it doesn't have to have a separate committee, but that function has to take place within the board----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","And it needs to be disclosed to shareholders in a very precise way, OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So, since I am the last questioner----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","----let us go back to this issue of the State thing again, which longer-term advocates of shareholder rights have said, look, if we could just give shareholders the ability to race to the top, as Senator Johanns, I think was alluding to, I am not positive--I certainly asked the question earlier in the same light--Mr. Castellani, how do you feel about shareholders being able to say that you are not going to be domiciled in whatever State you are in but you are going to be in Texas because it gives great shareholder rights?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Senator, if the majority of the shareholders want to change the logo to pink and make me stand on one leg, I change the logo to pink and stand on one leg. So it really is what the majority of the shareholders. But I think it is not a decision--I think we kid ourselves that this is a decision that is based on what Mr. Icahn is advocating, which is the ability of greater ease of change of control. One of the reasons why Delaware is very attractive to corporations is Delaware has an infrastructure, with all deference to my colleague here, that is very efficient in adjudicating issues between companies and shareholders, and shareholders and shareholders, prior to annual meetings or whenever they need to be adjudicated. Delaware is very, very good. They have--what have they got, ten judges and a couple hundred staff people that make decisions very, very quickly. So it is not just the structure of the law that is attractive but it is the ability of the State to implement its law and make decisions when issues are in contention very quickly and very efficiently.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","But while you are selling Delaware, and I am sure the Chambers of Commerce up there like that----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Well, let me give equal. New Jersey is also very good. Ohio is very good----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","----and I am sure----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Their pension funds must invest in your company.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","----Tennessee is very good.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","But back to the issue of whether they are good or not, and my guess is some of those are not so good that you just mentioned, but giving the shareholders the ability to do that is, in your opinion--and, by the way, by law? You have no problem with that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Yes, I would. Why, again, prescribe for all shareholders of all companies something that they already have the right to do within the States where they are incorporated if the States allow it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Does anybody strongly disagree with that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Just so we are clear, currently, shareholders do not have the right----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","Do not have the right.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","----do not have the right to force a reincorporation over the objection of the board, and I actually think for once I am on sort of the management side of the Business Roundtable, at least if I heard his comment earlier. I don't think that would be a good idea to introduce. It would be more powerful and more disruptive on behalf of shareholders than anything the SEC is proposing in the current environment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So you think that is a really bad idea?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","Well, I just--I think it would require a great deal of thought about how exactly it would be implemented, and I think to think of it as somehow a weaker version of shareholder proxy access is just descriptively a mistake. It would be actually more empowering----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","No, I agree.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Coates","OK.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","It is the most empowering thing, I think, that----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Castellani","And I want to make very clear that I associate myself with those remarks, that that is--I can't imagine what the benefit would be compared to the costs or the disruption.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Do you want to make a comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","I was just going to say, I think that is true. I think the moderate form is establishing the disclosure right for proxy access. But to go all the way to keep Governors happy, if you will, is to create competition amongst the States by fully empowering shareholders.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Yerger","As radical as the Council is, I have to tell you, this is not an issue we have endorsed at this point, is giving owners the right to reincorporate an entity. We are studying it, but I think that it is a complex issue that I would be very surprised the corporate community would support.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ferlauto","This is the moderate version.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Verret","I would also offer that proposals and changes of State of incorporation get introduced from time to time and the results are always there is pretty low shareholder interest in that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","OK. Listen, I want to say that while I ask numbers of questions, I am going to give the same disclosure as the SEC. None of them necessarily represent my point of view. It is just the best way to sort of understand what a very diverse panel of six people think about an issue and I very much appreciate all of your input today. I hope that if we do anything on corporate governance, I hope that it is modest and we realize that at the end of the day, a lot of factors led to the failures that we have had today, much of which, candidly, was generated out of this body and those who came before. I hope that we don't create a similar problem or another type of problem by over-legislating how the private sector governs itself. But I thank you all for your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Reed","Thank you, Senator Corker. I want to thank all the witnesses. This has been a very insightful panel, and I particularly thank you for the time and effort you put into this. It was quite obvious from the testimony and from your response to questions. Let me say for the record, witnesses' complete written testimony will become part of the hearing record and we are happy to include supporting documentation for the record. The record will remain open for 1 week, until August 5, 2009, for Members to submit their own personal written statements or additional questions for the witnesses. We ask that witnesses respond to any written questions that are sent within 2 weeks and note that the record will close after 6 weeks in order for the hearing print to be prepared. With that, I thank you again and thank my colleagues. The hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
