"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Let me apologize to my colleagues and the witnesses as well. It was a late hour last night when we changed the schedule, but as I am sure my colleagues are aware, anyway, we are going to have about six votes beginning around 10:30 to try and finish up the housing bill. And, therefore, I thought we would try to move this up a half an hour so we could have at least a good hour and a half with you. I am going to ask my colleagues to restrain themselves, if they can, in opening statements so we can get right to the witnesses and hear their thoughts. Sheila, welcome. Nice to have you back before the Committee. Let me just share some opening comments. Senator Shelby has a meeting. He will be here shortly. He had something around 9:10, so he will be coming along. I am going to begin. Normally, of course, I would wait for my colleague from Alabama, but in light of the fact of the change in the time here, we are going to begin, anyway, on this. So let me share some opening thoughts on this subject matter, and then we will go right to the witnesses. This morning is the 13th in a series of hearings since January to identify causes of the financial crisis and specific responses that will guide the Committee's formulation of the new architecture for 21st century financial services regulation. I welcome all of our witnesses. This morning, we are going to discuss regulating and resolving institutions whose failure would pose a risk to the financial sector and our underlying economy. To be sure, we meet at a moment when many of these so-called ``too-big-to- fail'' institutions are under a microscope, and for good reason. Consider for a moment the following financial institutions: Bear Stearns, Fannie and Freddie, Lehman Brothers, AIG, Washington Mutual, Wachovia, Citigroup, Bank of America. Inside of 14 months, every one of these institutions either failed or posed a risk of failing absent Government intervention. Some were sold under duress; others failed outright. Many were saved because the Government resorted to an array of loans, guarantees, and capital injections to keep these large, complex financial firms afloat. But, regardless, the result of this turmoil is clear, with 20,000 layoffs and 10,000 homeowners entering into foreclosure each and every day. As this Committee works to modernize our financial architecture, I believe it is essential that we identify ways to give the Government the tools it needs to unwind troubled, systemically important institutions in an orderly way that will put adequate safeguards in place to prevent unwarranted risky behavior on the part of the largest market actors and puts our economy at risk. And I would commend the administration again for sharing my belief that the resolution authority be given to the FDIC, with whom the expertise of unwinding failed institutions clearly lies. To be sure, we have seen unprecedented consolidation in the banking industry over the last few decades. In 1992, the 25 largest insured depository institutions accounted for a quarter of banking industry assets. As of 2008, the top 25 held over 60 percent of industry assets. Four U.S. bank holding companies now have over $1 trillion each in banking assets. At the same time the industry became increasingly consolidated, the institutions themselves became more interconnected, and as many of these failures have illustrated, their relationships with one another even more complex. The growth of the largely unregulated credit derivatives market and the ability to process transactions with increasing speed added to the unprecedented level of complexity as well. But it was the performance of our regulators, in my view, that spun this all out of control, allowing these financial institutions to take on more and more risk, more and more leverage, with far too much autonomy and far too little accountability. Essentially, regulators took our largest financial institutions at their word that they understood what they were doing, and clearly they did not. In fact, some had no idea at all. The question before this Committee today is how to prevent this from happening again and how do we create an architecture to allow for wealth creation and for productivity to be restored. Some have looked at the failure of many large, complex financial firms to manage their risks and the failure of regulators to adequately supervise them. They concluded that we can no longer afford to let institutions grow to a point where they put our financial system at risk. As economist Joseph Stiglitz has put it, many of these institutions became not just ``too big to fail,'' but also too big to save and too big to manage. Some would strictly limit the size of balance sheets or restore some of the restrictions on business line affiliations lifted a decade ago. Another option would be to impose more stringent capital requirements, deposit insurance assessments, and other costs to provide disincentives to becoming either too big or to complex. And still others suggest that it is unrealistic to believe that we could somehow abolish large, complex financial organizations. They suggest designing a regulatory framework that would make sure that taxpayers are not on the hook each time one of these companies gets in trouble. That would mean finding ways to ensure that the creditors as well as the shareholders can suffer losses when these companies get in trouble. As Warren Buffett said last week, the key to ensuring large financial institutions are run well is not only proper incentives for success, but also severe disincentives for failure. The truth is, unlike the average family in my State or my colleagues' States who has no choice but to live within their means, the large institutions throughout the crisis were always able to borrow more, draw down more, and relax their underwriting standards as their regulators stood by. Whatever else we do, that has to stop, in my view. Large financial companies may well need a different set of capital rules to ensure that they will have sufficient funds to absorb large, unprecedented losses. They may need new disclosure and responding requirements that would enable regulators to close them in an orderly way if they become troubled. If the AIG contemporary mess that this Committee helped to expose has taught us anything, it is that regulators need a much clearer picture of the arrangement that these firms get themselves into, not only to regulate them better but to extricate them from those arrangements if need be. Each of these approaches that I have mentioned this morning has merit, and it is my hope that today's hearing will offer an opportunity to fully explore each of these options. I will say again that I believe there is a need for systemic risk regulation to ensure that we no longer need to treat any institution as ``too big to fail.'' It is my preference that that authority not lie in one body. We cannot afford to replace Citi-sized financial institutions with Citi- sized regulators. The goals of our financial modernization efforts must be more transparency, more accountability, and more checks and balances. Today's witnesses I think will help us become better informed as to these steps. With that, I thank again everyone for being here, and, Sheila, we will begin with you.","Speech",""
"Ms. Bair","Good morning, Chairman Dodd, members of the Committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify on the need to address the issue of systemic risk and the existence of financial firms that are deemed ``too big to fail.'' The financial crisis has taught us that too many financial organizations have grown in both size and complexity to the point that they pose systemic risk to the broader financial system. In a properly functioning market economy, there will be winners and losers. When firms are no longer viable, they should fail. Unfortunately, the actions taken during the recent crisis have reinforced the idea that some financial organizations are ``too big to fail.'' The most important challenge now is to find ways to impose greater market discipline on systemically important financial organizations. Taxpayers have a right to question how extensive their exposure should be to such entities. A strong case can be made for creating incentives that reduce the size and complexity of financial institutions. A financial system characterized by a handful of giant institutions with global reach, even with a single systemic regulator, is making a huge bet that they will always make the right decisions at the right time. There are three key elements to addressing the problem of ``too big to fail.'' First, financial firms that pose systemic risks should be subject to regulatory and economic incentives that require these institutions to hold larger capital and liquidity buffers to mirror the heightened risk they pose to the financial system. In addition, restrictions on leverage and the imposition of risk-based assessments on institutions and their activities would act as disincentives to the types of growth and complexity that raise systemic concerns. The second important element in addressing ``too big to fail'' is an enhanced structure for the supervision of systemically important institutions. This structure should include both the direct supervision of systemically significant financial firms and the oversight of developing risks that may pose risks to the overall U.S. financial system. Centralizing the responsibility for supervising these institutions in a single systemic risk regulator would bring clarity and accountability to the efforts needed to identify and mitigate the build-up of risk at individual institutions. In addition, a systemic risk council could be created to address issues that pose risks to the broader financial system by identifying cross-cutting practices and products that create potential systemic risk. The third element to address systemic risk is the establishment of a legal mechanism for quick and orderly resolution of these institutions similar to that which we use for the FDIC-insured banks. Over the years we have used this to resolve thousands of failed banks and thrifts. The purpose of the resolution authority should not be to prop up a failed entity indefinitely or to insure our liabilities, but to permit a timely and orderly resolution and the reabsorption of assets by the private sector as quickly as possible. Done correctly, the effect of the resolution authority will be to increase market discipline and protect taxpayers. For example, our good bank/bad bank model would allow the Government to spin off the healthy parts of an organization while retaining the bad assets that we could work out over time. To be credible, the resolution authority must be exercised by an independent entity with powers similar to those available to the FDIC to resolve banks and clear direction to resolve firms as quickly and inexpensively as possible. To enable the resolution authority to be exercised effectively, there should be a resolution fund paid for by fees or assessments on large, complex financial organizations. To ensure fairness, there should be a clear priority system for stockholders, creditors, and other claimants to distribute the losses when a financial company fails. Finally, separate and apart from establishing a resolution structure to handle systemically important institutions, our ability to resolve non-systemic bank failures would be greatly enhanced if Congress provided the FDIC with the authority to resolve bank and thrift holding companies affiliated with a failed institution. By giving the FDIC authority to resolve a failing bank's holding company, Congress would provide the FDIC with a vital tool to deal with the increasingly complicated and highly symbiotic business structures in which banks currently operate. The choices facing Congress in addressing ``too big to fail'' are complex, made more so by the fact that we are trying to address problems while dealing with one of the greatest economic challenges we have seen in decades. The FDIC stands ready to work with Congress to ensure that the appropriate steps are taken to strengthen our supervision and regulation of all financial institutions--especially those that pose systemic risk. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Mr. Stern, who is the President, I should point out, of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, welcome to the Committee this morning, and thank you for accommodating the change in time as well.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Chairman Dodd, members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to review the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem with you today. The key to addressing ``too big to fail'' is to reduce substantially the negative spillover effects stemming from the failure of a systemically important financial institution. Before briefly going into specifics, I want to emphasize that these remarks reflect my views and not necessarily those of the Federal Reserve. To address the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem, we must understand the incentives of uninsured creditors of systemically important financial institutions, the incentives of the management of such institutions, and the incentives of policymakers responsible for economic and financial stability. We have a ``too-big-to-fail'' problem because creditors of such financial institutions expected, on the basis of relatively well-established precedents and on an understanding of policymakers' motivations, that protection would be provided if failure threatened. As a consequence, they had a most modest incentive to monitor the condition and prospects of these large institutions, leading to underpricing of risk taking. With risk underprices, and for a variety of other reasons as well, these institutions took on excessive amounts of it, leading eventually to the precarious position of some of them. And policymakers, fearing massive negative spillover effects to other institutions, financial markets more generally, and the economy itself, provided protection and validated creditor expectations. Just as incentives are at the heart of the ``too-big-to- fail'' problem, they necessarily must be at the heart of the solution. To address incentives, policymakers must deal with them at their core. Creditors must be put at risk of loss. Once uninsured creditors face appropriate incentives and change their behavior, the risk taking of systemically important institutions should diminish, reducing policymakers' concerns about spillovers. I have long maintained that ``too- big-to-fail'' bailouts are driven by concerns about potentially serious spillover effects. As a result, I recommend reforms that reduce the perceived or real threat of the spillovers that motivate after-the-fact protection of uninsured creditors, recognizing that policymakers first need to address the short- term problems in the financial system. I would start with three reforms that combined I call ``systemically focused supervision.'' First, I would increase supervisory focus on preparation for the potential failure of a large financial institution. This preparation will reveal the interconnections between firms and markets that may produce serious spillovers and identify the steps policymakers must take to address them. Second, I would enhance the existing prompt correct action regime by including forward-looking market data. This would help identify weak institutions that need early closure, which should reduce the losses and spillovers such institutions impose on others. Finally, I would advocate forthright communication of efforts to put creditors of systemically important firms at risk of loss. Creditors are not mind readers, and policymakers cannot expect them to divine the intention to put them at risk absent clear communication to that effect. I also support Government pricing through insurance premiums, for example, of the activities of systemically important financial institutions that potentially create significant negative spillovers. This seems like an efficient method for taking costs imposed on society and putting them rightly back on the firms to influence their behavior. I have considered other options as well for taking on ``too big to fail'' and discuss them in the written testimony. In contrast to these proposals, increasing the intensity of traditional supervision and regulation of large institutions has no clear ability to improve incentives and ultimately imposes losses on creditors. While I support efforts to improve it, I recognize that the recent record of traditional supervision and regulation in preventing excessive risk taking by systemically important firms is not encouraging. I have the same general reaction to proposals to reduce the size of large financial institutions. I have no particular empathy for managers and equity holders of large firms, but think efforts to break up these organizations will result in a focus on a very small number, thereby leaving many systemically important firms as is. Moreover, I am skeptical for the reasons noted previously that policymakers will effectively prevent the newly constituted smaller firms from taking on risks that can bring down others. In short, this reform does not seem to alter incentives sufficiently. I am more supportive of efforts to bring bank-like resolution regimes to non-bank but systemically important financial institutions. These proposals address some important spillovers and likely would work best if combined with the reforms I have already advocated. In closing, maintaining the status quo with regard to ``too big to fail'' could impose large costs on the U.S. economy. The economy cannot afford and does not have to ensure such costs. I encourage you to focus on proposals that address the underlying reason for protection of creditors of `too-big-to-fail'' financial institutions, namely, policymaker concerns about financial spillovers. I have offered a plan to address this crucial point. Absent this or a similar approach, I am concerned that we will not make significant progress against ``too big to fail.'' Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF GARY H. STERN, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, FEDERAL RESERVE BANK OF MINNEAPOLIS"
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Stern. We appreciate it. We appreciate both of you being with us. I will have the clerk turn on the clock. We will take about 5 minutes apiece or so as we move along here. I will not be rigid about it, but I will try to make sure everyone here--we have only a few members here this morning. Let me begin with you, Mr. Stern. You addressed this at least in your opening comments, and I wonder if you might be a bit more specific about it, and that is, this resolution mechanism we are talking about. I mentioned in my opening comments about the Treasury sort of embracing the idea that the FDIC probably has, of the existing regulatory agencies, the expertise and the background given their experience in dealing with banks to move in this direction. I wonder how you might react to it. Is there some idea of a bankruptcy court idea that may be more appealing? Can the FDIC, in your view, fill this function? What are your more specific----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, I am in favor of a bank-like resolution process for systemically important non-bank financial firms. I have been giving more thought, rather than to who, to how, and what I mean by that is it seems to me it is important that the resolution regime be established in a way that losses can, in fact, be put on uninsured creditors. And that requires, it seems to me, preparation in advance. That is, it gets to the spillover question I alluded to in my testimony. Policymakers will be unwilling to impose losses on creditors if they think the spillovers are going to do significant damage to other financial institutions, markets more generally, and the economy. So you want to prepare in the sense of both identifying, limiting, containing, and other ways of constraining the potential for spillovers. That has to be part of the preparation, in my judgment, for the effectiveness of that kind of resolution regime.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Okay. Let me raise this with both of you, if I can. Peter Wallison is going to testify in our second panel, be a witness in the second panel, and he raises an interesting concern: that a new system that tries to identify, regulate, resolve systemically important financial institutions may create a new class of protected companies that enjoy lower funding costs due to perceived Government backing and the like. I find that idea he has is intriguing, one that needs to be addressed. He sees this framework as expanding the safety net and adding moral hazard to the financial system in a way. Sheila, how do you react to that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think the concern relates to what we are talking about. We are talking about a resolution mechanism, not a bailout mechanism, and we think if you are going to create a new systemic risk regulator and identify it, particularly if that will involve identifying in advance institutions that could be systemic, that to do that without a separate resolution mechanism would dramatically increase moral hazard, because then you would be anointing institutions as those that the Government would continue to step in and support. So we think there needs to be a resolution mechanism that takes care of that, but we would certainly hope that Congress, if you took this step, would clearly set out a claims priority and say that the private stakeholders--the shareholders, and the unsecured creditors--would take losses and the priority for collateralized counterparties, et cetera. Also, the direction should be to resolve the institution promptly, not to just keep it going, but to break it up. I think a good bank/bad bank model would be a good one. We are set up already with our bridge bank authority to do that type of model. There was a good op-ed in the Wall Street Journal yesterday by Glenn Hubbard outlining that type of approach. Others have talked about it as well. But I think we need to be very clear that we are talking about a resolution mechanism, not a bailout mechanism, if we do that.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Stern, do you want to comment on that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Sure. I think that the issue that Peter Wallison identified is a serious and potential concern, and that is why I put my emphasis on imposing losses on creditors and making it known well in advance not only that you intend to do it, but you have put yourself in a position where you are, in fact, able to do it. So I----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, is this sort of the Warren Buffett disincentives, the thing he talked about, having the serious-- there are incentives to do things, and then there ought to be disincentives.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Go ahead. I did not mean to interrupt.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","No. That was the sum and substance of my comment.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Okay. Let me, if I can--by the way, I want to raise, Sheila, with you the issue of the idea of looking at--we are having a lot of conversations among ourselves and others about this structure and architecture. Nothing has been decided firmly, but there is a lot of conversation, obviously, about how to approach this. One of the conversations that we are having among ourselves is this systemic risk regulator and the idea of having maybe more of a council idea rather than a single regulator. And, again, the single regulator idea has a certain amount of appeal because there is an existing structure. It is the known. If we start talking about a council or a collegial approach, you are talking about something new. And, obviously, when you start talking about things new and how does it work--without trying to express the views of all of my colleagues, those who are sort of attracted to this idea, it is a multiple set of eyes looking at something, rather than a single set of eyes. I wonder if you might share some thoughts on that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, yes. We make a distinction between the potential oversight of systemic institutions, and the broader need for a coordinating body to be looking at the system for risk, for interrelationships among securities firms, banks, hedge funds and insurance companies. That is really where we saw some serious shortcomings. So we think for that latter issue, a council is much better equipped to deal with those types of systemwide issues that cross markets and cross different types of institutions. We think that would work, and the President's working group could transition into something like that. But it should be a real authority with the ability to set rules, for instance, set capital standards that might be across markets to make sure there is no arbitrage of capital standards, which we have had. The council should have the ability to write rules and collect data--those types of legal authorities. Yes, we think a council is much better suited for addressing that type of risk.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Do you have any quick comments on that, Mr. Stern? I do not know if you have heard----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","I think if we established a systemic risk regulator, it would be very important what we ask them to do, and I would put at least a good deal of emphasis on making sure that we identified and understood the interconnections, the large exposures among important firms, large reliance on particular markets, what happens if a particular market were, for whatever combination of reasons, to shut down and so on and so forth. Exactly who ought to do it, I might have a preference for having only one or two institutions do it as opposed to a council because of accountability. But I must admit I do not have a firm conviction about that.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. Senator Johanns?","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me, if I could, think out loud for a second, and then I would like your reaction to this. As I have sat through these hearings, there are dozens of complicated issues. You mentioned holding companies, for example. That in itself you could spend weeks on trying to figure that out. But I agree with you there needs to be something done here. There seems to be a real lack of ability to deal with that issue. But, in my mind, when I kind of think about what we are trying to figure out here, I am thinking about three areas, kind of three umbrella areas. The first one is oversight. When you are dealing with systemic risk, how do you put in place the oversight to deal with that? The second piece of this is the bailout piece. I would like to be able to sit here today and say to the American public this is never going to happen again, thank goodness that is behind us. But the reality is we have to have something in place because the oversight will not be effective if you do not have the next step. And then the third piece of this or the third umbrella is exit strategy. Once you are entangled in oversight bailout, how do you get yourself out of it? I would tell you personally I am personally appalled by this discussion by the Treasury Secretary, even the President has acknowledged, well, there may be other CEOs that get fired, and I am using my own words there. I never thought I would live long enough to see the day that somebody walked into the White House, a CEO in a private company, and left without their job. I just find that very, very troubling in terms of governmental intervention. Now, the first question about the first umbrella, the oversight. I like this idea of the panel, a group versus a person. Let me ask you this: Is there a governmental structure in place where that panel would fit? And I must admit I have the FDIC in my mind, and so, Sheila, I am just going to ask you directly: Is that something that fits within the FDIC?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","It could fit within the FDIC. We already have two other principals on our board. The head of the OCC and the OTS are, by statute, on our board. We already have all but one of the banking regulators represented on our board, so it could be modeled along those lines. We think the President's Working Group may be another model. That is an informal group that was set up by Executive Order after the 1987 market breakdown, and it has been a more informal way for regulators to have discussions and information sharing. That might be another model. Gary is right, it creates a little more complexity if you have a number of different people involved. But, this is so important, especially rearding the decision to resolve a systemically important institution. If you have the resolution authority, too, having multiple players involved in that decision is key. I am assuming that there will be some consolidation among banking regulators. So we suggest in the testimony that the Federal Reserve Board, the U.S. Treasury, the FDIC, and the SEC would be a good starting point. But, yes, the FDIC Board currently has the principals of other agencies on it, and it works pretty well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","The FDIC seems to work very well. You go in and you make very tough decisions, and yet it does not disrupt our economy.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right. Well, we think so. It is a painful process to close a bank, there is no doubt about it. And, we kind of joke internally about who else would want this responsibility. Who would you give it to? It is hard. You do get rid of management, and sometimes the lower-level employees lose their jobs, too. For the smaller banks, we always try to sell the whole bank to another local institution to provide that continuity of customer services and employees. But, it is a painful process. It does involve some specialized expertise, some specialized public relations in dealing with the communities that are impacted. But, we are well equipped. We have contractors in place that deal with asset management and auctioning assets or auctioning whole banks. I think we already have much of the talent that is out there now to deal with troubled institutions. We have been doing this for 75 years. We have resolved thousands of institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Gary, now if I could turn to you, and I am just about out of time, so I will have to urge you to answer a very complex question very, very quickly. But on the bailout and exit, what role do you see for the Federal Reserve in those areas? For example, yesterday Chairman Bernanke provided us with the balance sheets showing the various things that had been done. Is this a matter where in these two areas if we work to clean up their authority and deal with those kinds of issues, is that a workable approach?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, let me be brief and just make two comments. I think one of the objectives should be to reduce the probability and magnitude of bailouts going forward.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","And I think we can reduce the probability. I think we can reduce the extent of coverage, both who is covered and the amount of coverage. But it is going to take preparation and some of the steps I mentioned at the outset in terms of dealing with the incentives that uninsured creditors and policymakers confront. That is really all about preparation at the end of the day. It needs to be done in stable, relatively tranquil times. Obviously, in the midst of the crisis, it is very hard to work on those kinds of things. As far as exit strategy, I guess I would make one comment, and that is, I think that is mostly about credibility, and what I mean by that is we have to try to put ourselves in a position so that even if you do have to bail somebody out because the cost/benefit calculation suggests that is the right thing to do for the economy as a whole, so even if you do that, you want to make sure that the next steps you take reduce the probability that you will have to do it again.","Speech"," "
"Senator Johanns","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding the hearing, and thank you for your testimony. Mr. Stern, I wanted to come back to something you said a minute ago; when we think about the systemic risk regulator, that it is important that we think about what we are asking them to do. One of the things that I have been struck by in my conversations with people in the financial industry is not just that this is a leverage problem, a ``too-big-to-fail'' problem, but it may also be a complexity problem, particularly in a rising market, the tendency to create more and more complex instruments that people cannot necessarily keep track of, either in their scope or in their relationships among various financial institutions. I wonder in the context of thinking about--and I guess the other thing I would say is it makes a person somewhat skeptical that an incentive and disincentive regime is ever going to be strong enough to counteract those temptations. I guess my question to you is how do we manage to keep up with that level of complexity without diminishing the innovation that all of us need to see in our financial markets, but at the same time prospectively protect us from the kind of collapse that we have just faced?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, I think there are several aspects to that. One is, certainly, I am not trying to curtail appropriate innovation in the financial markets. I think, to the extent that we get the incentive--improve the incentives, we will get better pricing of risk. And that will deal directly with some of the concerns you have and the development of some of these instruments that, obviously, with the benefit of hindsight anyway, contained a good deal more risk than was appreciated at the outset. So I think that is one way to go. I think something we can also probably do in the supervisory area is where we see a very complex structure of an organization, ask about the economic rationale for that structure. And it is very good economic rationale for having X- hundred subsidiaries, for example. And if not, we could ask for streamlining of that kind of structure. So I think that is something else that could be done to help clarify the situation. I should also add--and this will be my final comment right now on this--is I think it is not just a question of incentives. I think ``too big to fail'' is a big, challenging problem. We need to improve incentives where we can. We also need to improve capital where we can. We should charge institutions some kind of insurance premiums, as I commented, where they are of systemic importance and pose systemic risks. I think we really need to address this on a number of fronts.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Chairwoman Bair, I do not know if you would like to add anything to that. As I have puzzled through the news accounts of this, one of the things you are really struck by is how evolutionary all of this is. You start out with credit default swaps that are based on one set of assets, and then you move over time to another set of assets, mortgages. And people lose track; the risk gets higher. I just wonder how we are going to write those rules in such a way that we are going to stay ahead of the curve rather than following behind.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, it is a challenge. And that is why we think there is a need to have greater market discipline. Too big to fail has diluted market discipline. There is only so much regulators can do, and you really need the market. You need people who want to invest or extend credit to these institutions, looking at their balance sheet, looking at their management, looking at the sophistication of their management and the risk management systems. What are their off-balance sheet exposures--are they done with proprietary trading, structured finance? All the things that we have seen have posed heightened risks for these larger institutions. You want the private sector in there looking at that as well. If they think the institution is ``too big to fail,'' you are going to dilute market discipline. And that is why we think it is particularly important to have a resolution authority. We also think that an assessment system can complement and enhance regulation. We have risk-based insurance assessments now for depository institutions. So there are certain categories of higher risk activity where we charge them a higher insurance assessment, for instance, for excessive reliance on broker deposits. This can also influence behavior, and I think this would be another tool that should be used for the systemic institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","I am going to ask the Chairman's indulgence because while I have got you here, I want to ask a slightly unrelated question about New Frontier Bank in Greeley, Colorado, which I know you are aware of. I wonder if you might say a word about where we are with that; and, also, more broadly, in the context of a region like that, a rural part of my state, where the local economy is heavily reliant on one institution, namely that one. That carries with it its own systemic risk for that little corner of the world. I wonder if you might talk a little about that situation; also, more broadly, the FDIC's approach in an area like that versus one where there are many other options.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, we did. We had a nice chat with Congresswoman Markey yesterday, too, about this. For the depositors, we have arranged for another bank to take over their accounts and help them transition into a new deposit account relationship. And for the loans, we are trying very hard to find other lenders to refinance those loans or to purchase them. I think one of the things where we engaged Congresswoman Markey, and I will take the opportunity to engage you as well, is to encourage other local lenders in the area to work with us and help these borrowers find new lending relationships. We are working very hard on that, and have been providing some additional financing out of the receivership to borrowers as we seek to transition them to lenders that are stronger. But we would love to work with your office. We talked with her about maybe having a town hall meeting. So we would be happy to work with you on that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennet","Thank you. I would appreciate that. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. Senator Bunning?","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Stern, do you think the market disruption, following Bear Stearns' bailout and Lehman Brothers' failure, in other words, the government picking a winner and a loser, was because of the bankruptcy itself or because everybody expected the creditors would be saved and the market had to adjust their expectations when they let Lehman go?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","I do think that when Lehman was let go, that probably came as a surprise to at least some of the creditors of Lehman, even though, of course, I think it was widely known in the financial marketplace that Lehman was experiencing some funding and other difficulties. Having said that, I think it is worth adding that, clearly, in the wake of Lehman, AIG and--the difficulties of AIG were revealed, and Merrill Lynch was purchased by Bank of America. So I think the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Under the gun.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","So I think the whole scale of the problem turned out to be much greater than anticipated by people in the markets. And AIG was a AAA rated company. I think that came as a genuine and sizable shock.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","But the AIG was rated a AAA company with the hedge fund in England not being attached. They are insurance companies.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","You will have to ask AAA. You will have to ask the rating agencies.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Yeah, the rating--that is who I really need to ask, is the rating agencies. Mr. Stern, you mentioned that regulators needed to be better understood, the connection between firms. Do you think there are some types of connections or products that should be limited or banned?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","I am not knowledgeable enough a priori to say that we ought to ban some interconnections or some products. What I would say is if we identified interconnections and exposures and potential vulnerabilities that looked like they would lead to serious problems at a number of institutions-- that is, if one institution got into serious difficulty, it would spread in substantial ways to others--then it is an opportunity to do one or both of two things; either to push to reduce those exposures as a regulator and/or to figure out how you are going to deal with the spill-over effect should problems arise. That is, how are you going to contain the problems. So I do think that would be a very valuable, important exercise. That is part of my proposal when I talk about----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I complimented you in my opening statement, but I did not get to make it.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","----preparing for these kinds of problems. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","That is all right. For either of the witnesses, what specifically in the bankruptcy laws is not sufficient for resolving financial institutions?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I go into that in a little more detail in my testimony. I think there are a couple of things. First, there is the ability to set up a bridge bank. I think continuity of operations, especially for the systemic functions, is important to a resolution mechanism. We have it now with banks. We think that works well. Another key difference is how derivative contracts are treated. In a bankruptcy, the derivatives counterparties have the immediate right to close out their position. With Lehman Brothers, you saw a situation where everyone was doing that, grabbing the collateral, selling it off and going out and re- hedging.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Can I just interrupt you a second?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Sure.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Because we had testimony from the Secretary of the Treasury, past and present, and the head of the Federal Reserve, both present and past, that we should not involve ourselves in overseeing derivatives and credit-default swaps.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","I mean, sitting right where you sat----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","You never heard that from me, Senator. No. And I would say, high on the priority of this body should be to review the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. I think that has shackled the ability of regulators to provide greater oversight of those markets. I do not know what they said, but I feel strongly we need greater oversight of those markets.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","So do I.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Okay. But our resolution mechanism allows us to accept or reject those contracts. We can require the counterparties to continue to perform in those contracts instead of grabbing the collateral. I think that is another key advantage of our process.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Sterns, just hold on just a second, while I have Sheila. When do you expect to end the TLGP, and can all banks survive without it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","We have been trying to ease out of that program. We have put surcharges on the program, and are putting those surcharges into the Deposit Insurance Fund to try to reduce pressure on the special assessment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","To other banks.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes, exactly, the smaller institutions. We are working to stabilize the situation. We very much want to end it on October 31st.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Are you going to be able to do that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I am optimistic that we will. We will have to wait and see where we are, but I am optimistic that we will. Mr. Sterns, would you like to say something about bankruptcy?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","No. The only thing I would add to Chairman Bair's comments is with regard to some of the derivatives and credit-default swaps, obviously, we are moving to central counterparties' clearinghouses. I think that is a very important step. I think that will help to standardize the products. It will take a good deal of risk out of the business. And I am cautiously optimistic that that will turn out to be a way to effectively address at least some of your concerns.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In other words, we were just a little behind the curve in regulatory oversight by the advice of the Federal Reserve chief, both Chairman Greenspan and Chairman Bernanke. And both Treasury secretaries said they did not need those oversights.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Well, you know, all I can say at this point is it has been a difficult lesson.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","It certainly has, and an expensive one. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. By the way, on that clearinghouse idea, I know of no dissenting voices, at least on this Committee or others I have talked to about it. It is going to be very much a part of that architecture we are talking about. Senator Warner?","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for the hearing. Let me move to a slightly different subject as well. I want to come back to systemic regulator, but I would like to hear Ms. Bair and Mr. Stern--we all have been waiting for some time for the release of the so-called stress test results. And we have heard Treasury say that none of the 19 banks are going to ``fail.'' One, I would like to get your evaluation of have these tests been rigorous enough, number one. Two, what additional steps can you or we take to give confidence to the markets the analysis has been rigorous enough? And, three, what else can we do to encourage these institutions that need additional capital to push and prod them into hopefully finding that in the private sector?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","All of these institutions that exceed regulatory standards are well capitalized. The stress test really was to determine, if we have a more adverse economic scenario over the next couple of years, will the banks have adequate capital buffers now to withstand that more adverse economic scenario. So in that sense, the stress test is more rigorous than the current regulatory standards for being well capitalized.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Although, again, we are rapidly approaching the outer reaches of----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, that is true.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","----the downside.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think that is right. This is something that needs to continue to be monitored. And we do this all the time, and we will continue to do so. But I think even though the unemployment rate used in the more adverse scenario could have been a little bit higher, I think on home price declines, we have been pretty aggressive. So I am hoping that all nets out. But, clearly, it needs to continue to be monitored. I think this will be a confidence- instilling announcement. There will be additional needs for capital buffers for some institutions, but I think there will be mechanisms to do that within the next six months. And, yes, certainly I would agree, those institutions need to look to non-government sources first. The Treasury can be there as a backstop, but they should look to non-government sources, first and foremost to raise new equity, if possible. If they cannot do that, or in conjunction with that, banks can consider converting some of their other securities in their capital structure into common stock to increase the level of tier 1 common equity, which is very important for market perception right now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","And you are confident that there will be enough data released that will result in a confidence building rather than a confidence weakening?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I hope so. This is an interagency process, and it is a holding company process. It has been led by the Federal Reserve as it should be. They are the holding company regulator. I think they have done an outstanding job. They have a great staff. And so I think that it will be confidence instilling. Obviously, there are judgment calls that have to be made on all of this, and I am sure there will be some that say we are being too tough, and there will be analysts that say we are not being tough enough. But, hopefully, we are in the middle there, at the right place. But a lot of it is just judgment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Stern, do you have a comment?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","I think Chairman Bair covered it thoroughly. And I would prefer not--until the results are out, I would prefer not to go further.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I would like to go back, on my own remaining time, to the notion that the Chairman raised in terms of systemic risk and the idea of a council, which I think has some attractiveness but also some challenges. What guidance/advice would you have if we were to, at least, continue to pursue the possibilities of this option, of how we would make sure that information would actually be forced up and truly shared? Number one. Two, how would we ensure, and what structural advice could you give us to ensure that this council would not end up becoming simply a debating society? And number three, when this council or group reach some conclusion, how could we ensure that it could act with some force? I would love you to comment on all three.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think accountability will be key. The statute needs to put accountability for systemic risk with this council. It needs to be given real authority to write rules, to set capital standards, to collect information, and make sure it is shared with the other regulators. If you provide that mandate and that accountability, as well as real legal authority, I think you will get the result that you want. There is nothing perfect about supervision, and this is why we have also suggested a resolution mechanism to enhance market discipline as well as protect taxpayers. In addition, we have suggested an assessment system that the resolution authority would have as well to provide disincentives for higher risk behavior. I think with those three steps in combination, you would dramatically improve the situation. Part of the problem is nobody really has the mandate right now for the entire system. There were problems. For instance, capital arbitrage between investment banks and commercial banks--different capital standards. That is exactly the kind of issue this type of council could have not only identified but also addressed.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","But one of the things we need to do is make sure that that information that may currently reside in the day-to-day prudential regulator actually would get pushed up and actually shared, which----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That is right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","----seems in the past that some of this information has been out there, but it has not been----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","That is exactly right. There needs to be clear authority to collect and to force the sharing of the information. We give the SEC our bank data; they give us their trading data. You need a mechanism to do that. Right now, sometimes it eventually happens, but it can be a long process, and it is not a coordinated, systematic process. Establishing a council with the mandate and the legal authority to carry out that mandate would dramatically improve the situation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Chairman, I know I have gone beyond my time, but if I could have Mr. Stern answer the question, too, sir?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes. Well, I think two things are going to be very important in that regard. One is authority to act. And I would add that working with the supervisors is very important because they have a lot of on-the-ground information that would be valuable in this process. But I also would think that for systemic supervision to be effective, this group, whether it is an institution or whether it is a council, or whatever it is, would have to have the ability, under the right circumstances, to intervene if they thought that the consolidated supervisor, whether it was a bank supervisor or an insurance company supervisor or whatever, was not doing an adequate, sufficient job. So from their judgment, if the job that was being done by the principal supervisor just was not adequate, they could step in and ask for more forceful action, and I think that would be important.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","That is a very important point because that gets central to the debate, in a sense, whether or not you have sort of the corporate model or you have a risk assessment officer that is watching everything and advises the corporation when they think things are straying off or actually has the authority to reach in and stop something from happening. And that debate is one we have not resolved. That is a very critical moment, as to what kind of authority you actually invest, whether it is the individual or whether it is the council. And I am more attracted to the council idea. Senator Corker?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you. Thanks for having this hearing. I appreciate our witnesses coming in and thank them for their testimony, which I read this morning early. I have to tell you that I especially---- Excuse me, Gary. But I especially liked the testimony by our FDIC leader. And I find it to be just an absolute stunning rejection of the policies that have been put forth by our Treasury Secretary. And I very much like what you had to say. There might be some details. But I find it amazing that your embrace of the free market is so different from our Treasury Secretary, who, in essence, has come up here talking about wanting the powers, in perpetuity, to invest taxpayer money in entities that pose systemic risks, forever. In essence, creating another Fannie or a Freddie in the process. So it is an amazing thing to me. And, also, by the way, sharing with the public who those entities are by causing them to pay higher premiums so that everybody understands that they are never going to fail. So I just want to thank you for bringing sanity into this discussion. I very much appreciate your presentation, and very much appreciate your willingness to take something that is more the American way into your thinking here and certainly presenting to us. Now, let me ask you a question. Timing. We have had--I actually appreciate the way our chairman has handled this in that he has not tried to rush through this. I know that he and the ranking member agree on that. I know that this resolution authority, though, is important right now. Okay? The other pieces of it do not have to come into play necessarily. We are not going to solve this problem through regulation we put in place today. But I would love to hear about the resolution authority piece, number one, if you feel it can be done separately and what the timing of that should be.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think that just giving us the authority to resolve bank and thrift holding companies could be done more quickly. You do not need to decide what is systemic and what is not, nor who is going to be providing the broader systemic regulation. That would be a huge contribution to the tools that we have in dealing with the current situation. So I think that this could be addressed separately, and it would be very helpful to have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","I do hope there is some--that you will coach us and help us figure out a way to maybe deal with the resolution issue and let the other be dealt with when there is not a crisis; otherwise, we will probably not end up with a cause-neutral solution. Okay? We will be focused on CDS's and everything else. But thank you. Let me ask you this. Many of our institutions have talked about wanting to leave the TARP program, but one of the most beneficial pieces of what we have done is the TGLP program, TLGP program, where, in essence, they are able, through government guarantees, to borrow money. If we cause these folks--if we allow these folks to leave the TARP program, should we also make them leave this other thing that is actually a greater benefit to them, a government guarantee for their debt? Should we also cause them to leave at the same time?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I would point out that the TLGP program has been a moneymaker for us. We have collected over $7 billion in premiums from it, and we have had no losses. That has helped. Some of the surcharges on that program are now helping to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund, where we have losses through our normal resolution activity. So I think there have been some benefits to the government and the FDIC for that program.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So now you are moving the free enterprise into government and we are making money----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I do not. We would like to get out of that program October 31st, and that is the plan right now. We had an opt-in or opt-out procedure when we instituted the program. I was worried about adverse selection. So I think we would like the institutions that are in the TLGP now to stay in it until October 31st under the current terms. But then after that, we would like to end the program.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Is that possible?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I sure hope so, Senator. I think we will know more in the third quarter. But that is the current strategy. I will guarantee you that if we cannot end the TLGP for everybody, the fees will go up. Something we had originally talked about, which we did not do because the markets were under such stress, would be to only guarantee a percentage, say 90 percent or 80 percent, to start weaning the private markets off of this and take some percentage of the risk. So there are different ways we can exit if we cannot by October 31st. But our strong preference is just to get out on October 31st.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","This is, apparently, going to be my last question. If we end the program on October 31st, my sense is that we, potentially, may need this resolution ability in place prior to then because it would be my sense that there are a lot of institutions in this country that cannot survive without that program being in place. I am just wondering if you might respond to that.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think that is a valid observation. The flexibility and the tools we have to deal with this, have been hampered by our lack of ability to deal with structures at the holding company level. So a lot of this open institution assistance has been needed because we do not have other tools available. It would be helpful to give us flexibility. It is the kind of thing you hope you will never have to use. But I think having it now would be extremely helpful. Also, we find with the smaller institutions that just a thread of resolution authority can trigger actions that might not otherwise take place. And so, for a variety of reasons, it will be a helpful tool to have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","We appreciate your willingness to talk with us on the telephone from time to time, and I hope that will continue. And, again, I know that you have spent most of your life in government. I thank you for proposing something that is sane, that actually alleviates the moral hazards that our Treasury Secretary has tried to lay out. I would love to hear of you-all's interpersonal conversation some time, but I will not ask for that now. Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","You are really treading on thin ice there. Thank you. By the way, the resolution mechanism is something we all feel pretty strongly about, and whether or not we are able to move forward with a larger proposal, including the resolution mechanism, is a good point. And this is something I have to take the temperature of my colleagues on as to how they feel about it. But I hear what you are saying, and I do not disagree with my friend and colleague from Tennessee about the importance of that issue, having a mechanism in place. I regret we do not now. It would have been a very different situation, in many ways, if we had such. So I will be in conversations with my colleagues, certainly Senator Shelby, about the best way to proceed on that. And I invite the comments of my colleagues and thoughts on this matter as well, as to whether or not we ought to proceed with that or whether or not we will be in a position where we can actually accommodate that as part of a larger proposal. With that, Senator Menendez.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairlady Bair, let me thank you for all your work. I think it has been extraordinary. And I was listening to my dear friend and colleague, Senator Corker, laud your proclivities to the free market, which we share. But you are not for a free- for-all market, are you?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No, no.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","That is what I thought. So let me ask you a couple of questions. One of the fundamental questions--I know we have talked about how we regulate and how we look at systemic risk and systemic regulators. I would like to take a step back from that because I think you have some testimony that maybe you did not do in your oral presentation that is very important for the Committee to be considering as well, and that is, if we have gotten to the point that an institution is ``too big to fail,'' haven't we in some respects already failed?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think that is right. It has diluted market discipline and helped contribute to getting us into this situation, and we need to end it. I think that is true.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","So in that respect, because it poses potentially such risk to the overall system and the economy, how do we--I think you had some very interesting suggestions. One is that in your testimony on page 4, you say that ``the academic evidence suggests that benefits from economies of scale are exhausted at levels far below the size of today's largest financial institutions.'' And then you went on, on page 6, to talk about some of those things that we might do prospectively and preventively to not only regulate the system, but to create, I would say, safeguards from maybe getting to that point where we might be ``too big to fail.'' Can you talk about some of those?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right. We charge premiums for deposit insurance on a, risk-adjusted basis. We charge a higher assessment for institutions that engage in behaviors that we know are higher risk and that can increase our resolution costs. I think you could have an assessment system that would help build up a fund so that if a very large, complex organization got itself into trouble, you could put it into a resolution process. If the Government had to absorb losses as part of that resolution, you could fall back on this fund as opposed to going to the taxpayer, which is what is happening now. I think that type of process could provide economic disincentives for higher-risk behavior. That might be preferable to just trying to say you cannot do this or you cannot do that. Frequently, when you try to just ban certain products or practices, people find a way around the ban, or you can create an arbitrage in an unintended fashion. So I think creating the economic disincentives so banks pay a much higher assessment for actions that post more systemic risk would be a powerful tool. There are certain areas where it is quite obvious that the activities were higher risk--for example, structured finance, and credit dafault swaps. This would be one additional tool that could be used.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","How about graduated capital reserve requirements?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes, absolutely. There is broad consensus on having countercyclical capital requirements. During good times, the larger institutions in particular must build up their capital so that they can draw down upon those in bad times. That is absolutely essential. I think there is broad international consensus on that point.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","You also said here, ``there firms''-- referring to the ones who create some higher risk--``should be subject to higher Prompt Corrective Action . . . limits under U.S. laws.''","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","``Regulators also should take into account off-balance-sheet assets and conduits as if these risks were on-balance-sheet.''","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes. That is right. Menendez. Something that you promote as well.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Yes, absolutely. The off-balance-sheet exposures where institutions were not required to maintain capital against those exposures were found very quickly when those off- balance-sheet vehicles got into trouble. They came back on- balance-sheet pretty fast. I think the accounting industry is moving in that direction as well. Those exposures should be reflected on-balance-sheet and capital should be held against them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Let me ask you one question that is not per se on topic, but since you are here: Since we seem like we are moving in the direction of giving you the higher borrowing authority, and I continue to hear from all those community banks who were not really part of our challenge in this economy, how quickly, assuming that it is signed into law, do you anticipate that the FDIC will be able to stabilize or lower the fees it is charging these banks?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think we will do it very quickly, certainly before the end of the month, assuming this authority goes through, and it looks like it will. And thank you all for your leadership in getting this done. It will be before the end of the month. We will make an announcement on that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. And let me say just on that point, we thank you, Ms. Bair, for the work of the FDIC and the communication with the Committee. We have had a good debate this week on the subject matter and have expanded the legislation, but I think on the central points regarding the deposit insurance and the lending authority, borrowing authority, there is pretty much consensus--not everyone, but pretty much consensus on this. But there has been some debate about other matters before the floor, but we have resolved at least some of those and are moving forward.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to ask--this may have been asked earlier. I was not here early this morning. A threshold question comes to me: What constitutes ``too big to fail''? What constitutes that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","How do you define that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","It is difficult to define. I think it is market perception as much as a precise definition. It is not just a function of size, it is really a function of interrelationship. In general, an institution would be ``too big to fail'' if, in a situation where it did fail and repudiated all its various obligations, there would be collateral systemic impact so that other firms would start being brought down because of that. That is how I look at it, and I think that is why we found ourselves in a box with some of these financial institutions. Because of the potential domino effect, that Government intervention was deemed necessary.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Stern, President Stern.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","My definition would be similar. I think of it in terms of an institution who, if it ran into substantial difficulty, would impose significant spillover effects on other significant institutions and/or a range of financial markets as well. So I would define it in that kind of very practical, operational way having to do with significant spillovers.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Could a hands-on regulator or regulators-- hands-on--help prevent this, in other words, from becoming too interconnected, see what is going to happen or could happen down the road? Because if you can prevent something, it is a lot better than picking up the pieces, is it not?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes, I would say two things about that. I think it would take a reorientation of traditional supervision and regulation. Rather than worrying principally about the safety and soundness of the institution per se, you have to broaden your perspective to think about who would be affected and to what magnitude if the institution got into serious difficulty. But even if you did that, I would be concerned that that by itself would not be sufficient without going the next step and preparing, one way or the other, to limit, to diminish the potential for spillovers.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Stern, the idea of imposing higher capital requirements--this has been talked about here, alluded to this morning--on ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions has some appeal. Your testimony advocates, as I understand it, capital tools that create capital when firms need it most. You need it most, it seems to me, when you do not have it, so to speak, when you are in a downturn. What type of capital tools were you referring to in your testimony? And how would these additional tools be put in place? And could regulators take action under existing authority to require those types of tools? Or will it be something we will have to address in legislation?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, one suggestion that has a lot of appeal to me is something called ``contingent capital,'' where a firm would issue a debt instrument which would have, as its capital diminished at some point, with a formal trigger or perhaps under regulatory instructions, that debt instrument would convert to equity. That is why it is called ``contingent capital.'' So you would have additional capital, in fact, when you needed it most, when your capital was diminishing and your position was deteriorating. And I think that is an attractive idea, and I would certainly advocate and support it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","In your tenure as President of the Reserve Bank there, have you known any banks in the area to fail that were well capitalized, well managed, and well regulated?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, I think with the benefit of hindsight, the answer to that is no. But, occasionally--usually I think it is fair to say, especially if it is a relatively small, straightforward institution, the problems are well recognized in a timely way. I think the problem is with large, complex institutions that is a much more significant challenge, especially to do it in a timely way. And even if you identify the problems in a timely way, taking corrective action in a timely way is a very significant challenge, in my judgment.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","To both of you, is there really in the banking business any substitute for capital, real capital?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think capital is absolutely central in its importance, and we need more capital now and in the future. And we need countercyclical capital requirements, and I like the contingent debt concept. It is a good idea as well. I think you need market discipline, too. If an institution is undertaking very high risk activities, even at a 20-percent capital level--and we have seen this in smaller institutions-- it can go pretty fast. So I think you need good, common-sense oversight, but you also need that complemented by market discipline, which, again, ``too big to fail'' has diluted.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes, market discipline and capital are complements, not substitutes. I think they are both critical here.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","They work together. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. I am glad you made that point, Sheila, because I can think of several institutions today that have very high capital standards but are in trouble. And the assumption because they have a lot of capital that they are not in trouble is the conclusion, and that is not the case. But I agree with my friend from Alabama that is an important--capital standards are critically important, but I am glad you mentioned the market discipline as well in all of that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both not only for your testimony but particularly, Chairwoman Bair, for your very effective leadership. Do you think we should return to something much closer to Basel I capital standards rather than continue the Basel II regime?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I absolutely think that the structure of Basel II, the Advanced Approaches, continues to be highly problematic. There has been a lot of work to try to fix it. At some point you wonder, well, should we just start over as opposed to trying to fix it? Thank goodness we have always maintained the leverage ratio in the United States, and that we are still under Basel I. I think there is increasing international agreement that we need an international leverage ratio. We are calling it a ``supplemental capital standard'' now, but that is in essence what we are talking about. And, in terms of the capital standard based on risk-weighted assets, it could be made more nuanced and more granular. But we can do that by building on the Basel I framework of buckets of different asset categories with hard and fast risk weights and capital requirements as opposed to this more subjective model-based regimen that we had with the Advanced Approaches under Basel II. The basic approach under Basel I is workable. It needs to be improved. It needs to be more granular. But, making enhancements to Basel I might be more productive at this point than continuing to try to work with Basel II.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","We have operated under Basel I. It is a known entity. Rather than inventing a new third approach, it might be better to return back to something that we have operated under.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think that would be a very viable path. It is just one opinion. Obviously, there are a lot of voices on capital standards. But I think that would be faster and get us to a stronger capital regime. Yes, I do.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Mr. Stern, do you have any views?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes, I think it is very important that we get capital right, and I certainly think that Basel II ought to undergo a very thorough review, and we should ask ourselves if that is going to take us where we want to go. And as I have already suggested, I think while we need to get the capital right, I think that the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem is sufficiently challenging, that capital by itself is not likely to be the entire solution. And so that is the reason I have suggested a number of other initiatives as well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Do you believe that the Federal Reserve has the authority to require a regulated entity to divest itself of an operation or enterprise because they do not have the managerial capacity to do it correctly?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","As a legal matter, I do not know if we have the authority for that. As a practical matter, I think that is a very difficult thing to do. You might prevail. But, obviously, if the organization thought it was integral to its operations and to its profit-making opportunities, it would undoubtedly want to resist such action.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Well, if you are the authority and you have the--since I am continually impressed with the authority of the Federal Reserve over the last few weeks and months to do things, I think you are not giving yourself enough credit for the leverage you might have. But one of the issues of not only correcting a situation but preventing a situation is having perhaps the authority to step in and say these activities are great, but they are just--you are not managing them well--which would send a stronger signal to management than simply saying we know we cannot do anything, but we wish you were better managers.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes, and, you know, as I commented a little bit earlier, I do think that identifying those situations is an important responsibility and a challenging one. But as I commented, even when you identify those things, taking timely action is very challenging, especially in good times, by the way, when it looks as if everything is operating smoothly, and the rationale for such a divestiture, for example, would not be immediately accepted.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","I think you are absolutely right. I mean, I think that the irony here is it is the good times where the seeds are sown for the bigger harvest of the future, and it is hard in practice. Let me ask just a final point. One of the problems we have is we have talked about the leverage and the capital ratios of regulated entities. But what about the embedded leverage of some of their counterparties, the hedge funds, so that what looks like an appropriate loan based on the capital of the regulated entity becomes, you know, much less acceptable? How do we deal with that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Hopefully, if it is a regulated bank, they should be looking at their counterparty exposure. If their counterparty is overleveraged, then that might not be a transaction they should do. One area that a systemic risk council, with the regulators coming together, should look at is how leverage constraints apply across the board. It is very difficult to have even higher capital standards than we have now for banks. If there are other major parts of the banking sector that can lever up much higher, you are going to be creating incentives to drive activity into less regulated venues. We need some minimal standards that apply across markets, and leverage is probably one area we need to review.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Let me just follow up quickly. This systemic council of regulators I think--well, let me ask you: Should they also have sort of the responsibility to have an analytical staff that would try to anticipate issues? Coming from my other Committee, the Armed Services Committee, we spend a lot of time and a lot of money gaming what could happen, what might not happen, what are the pressures on systems? That I do not believe exists in any sort of consistent way within financial regulation.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","We do it within our respective spheres. We do that internally at the FDIC with insured depository institutions. So I absolutely think that there should be an analytical staff. That would be a key part of the council to enable it to collect the data and analyze it and identify issues to try to get ahead of them.","Speech"," "
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Just on that point, that is a very good point. I was thinking when you were defining it, giving your definition of ``systemic risk,'' and I agree with you, size alone is--if we gravitate on that, we are going to miss an awful lot. But one thing I did not hear you say, and that is, products. What is maybe a relatively small product can migrate very quickly through the system, and that product can become a source of tremendous systemic risk. And so in addition to the entity itself having tentacles that reach out that cause problems, we need to be looking--I think Jack's point is a good one--an analytical staff that is looking at what products are and can that product pose systemic risks.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","While it may be innocent enough or small enough, at some juncture the analysis that that product could create problems I think is a very important issue as well.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I agree.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Merkley.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. I want to ask--and this question is more directed to Mr. Stern, but, Sheila, please feel free to chime in here. Mr. Stern, in your writings, you have noted the unintended side effects of stepped-up prudential capital requirements may encourage banks with those stepped-up requirements to actually increase their risk to gain the same returns, and this raised kind of an inherent dilemma, if you will, of that strategy. And how does that play out in terms of the pros and cons of public policy?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, I think that is a potential reaction and something of potential concern, and that is why I have advocated not relying just on capital or just on one or two approaches to dealing with ``too big to fail.'' I think this has to be a multifaceted approach with a number of initiatives that straighten out the best we can the incentives and improved market discipline as well as doing things like improving capital and so forth, because this is a difficult issue to address. Its consequences are potentially very serious, and so I think we need to address it across a number of fronts.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Do you wish to add anything on that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think that is a risk. We have capital standards based on the riskiness of assets in addition to the leverage ratio, which is core capital to total assets. So through our risk-based capital system, we try to address that problem. But it is imprecise, necessarily imprecise, and so it is something that supervisors have to be constantly vigilant of.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","To follow on, Mr. Stern, I think another point you have made is that we in some degree already have a systematic risk regulator in the Fed. But can the Fed really balance its various requirements and play that role? Mr. Stern I do not think I have suggested that the Fed is the systemic risk regulator. Obviously, that is an issue that is under discussion and consideration at the moment. I do think the Federal Reserve, because we have longstanding responsibilities in holding computer and bank supervision, as well as experience in payment systems and because we are ultimately the last provider of liquidity in the system, have a role to play in this, clearly. But I have not tried to weigh in exactly on what the exact structure of the systemic risk regulator ought to be.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","And I apologize if you have already been asked this question before, but I think you have emphasized-- and correct me if I am wrong--that policymakers should focus on counterparty risk and not risking shareholders, but that one of our challenges is to convince uninsured creditors that they will bear losses when their financial institution gets into trouble. Do we need to do that in a statutory sense to address the moral hazard, if you will, of expectations that shareholders will be bailed out?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, shareholders, of course, in some of these cases have lost a lot of money, and that has been appropriate, but it is not sufficient to address moral hazard. It is the creditors, the uninsured creditors, that need to take some losses going forward--not in the middle of a crisis like this, I will hasten to add, but going forward. And so we want to put ourselves in a position to do that. The legislation is not up to me, but, obviously, if it is going to contain, as it may well appropriately contain, a systemic risk exception so that, you know, if there really is the threat of systemic difficulties that would threaten not only the functioning of the financial system but maybe parts of the economy as well, clearly policymakers ought to be able to deal with those. What you want to put yourself in the position to do is to invoke that systemic risk exception as infrequently with as low a probability as possible. So it seems to me that legislation can help, but it is not going to get you the entire way, assuming it has that systemic risk exception--and, indeed, it seems appropriate to have such a thing.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Sheila, do you wish to add at all to that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","No. I would agree with that. With the bank resolution process we have now, Congress has laid out a very clear claims priority for us. One of the benefits of having a resolution authority for holding companies and perhaps non-bank financial institutions is that Congress would lay out what the rules of the game are so market participants could understand in advance what their losses will be if an institution gets into trouble. I think that increases the market discipline, which is what we are all trying to get back into the system.","Speech"," "
"Senator Merkley","Well, thank you very much to both of you for your testimony and for helping us wrestle with this pretty sizable issue.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. Before I turn to Senator Bennett, just to inform my colleagues and others who are gathered here today, there has been a little change in the order on the floor of the Senate. Several of our colleagues have to be at the White House for a meeting. We are going to begin at 10:40 having three votes regarding the housing bill. And then there will be a break, and they are going to bring up the defense procurement bill for opening statements for an hour. And then we will come back to finish up the remaining votes and final passage on the housing bill sometime after 11:30, in which case what I am going to suggest is that Senator Warner has graciously agreed to take over the chair and the gavel--which means you can only conduct a hearing. You cannot pass any bills, Mark. Then we will start the second panel--obviously complete with this panel, and we thank both of our witnesses. We will recess and then come back for the second panel. And I apologize to them, but I cannot control the order of business on the floor of the Senate. So we will come back and have to finish up. But we can get started, anyway, with the second panel, if that is appropriate, Mark.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thanks to the two witnesses. I apologize for not having been here for your testimony. I had other assignments. One of the things that has come out of this experience we are going through that I had not realized before--maybe both of you did--is that, in addition to bank and traditional kinds of banking activities, at least Citi performs a series of functions that are very profitable and are systemically absolutely essential--that is, the evening sweeps, the transactions that go on, et cetera. I understand that as much as 80 percent of some of these almost clerical functions worldwide run through Citi in one way or another. And if City were allowed to fail as a bank, it would be unable to perform these services that it performs for the system as a whole, and I have been pondering that ever since I found out about it as to how that impacts this whole question of what we do with City or any other organization. Now, as I have talked with some people outside of Citi about it, they have said, ``Senator, that is a very profitable business, and there would be plenty of people who would step forward and say we will be happy to perform it.'' Well, it is one thing for them to say, ``Yes, we will be happy to perform it,'' and it is another thing mechanically for them to be able to perform it in a seamless fashion that does not create tremendous difficulties. So I would like your response to that. Then the other thing that occurs to me that I have learned about all of this, I will not quote the numbers because I will get them wrong, but during this period of time, again picking on City, where they have taken enormous losses, they have at the same time paid a very significant amount of taxes, because the IRS rules are different from the accounting rules, and when you have an enormous loss that comes from mark-to-market, the IRS says, no, we will not allow that to happen until the assets are actually sold; so that we have had, to me, the enormous anomaly of having tremendous injections of cash into City to keep them viable, at the same time that Citi is making tremendous contributions or payments into the Treasury in the form of taxes. And I have a little bit of a hard time understanding why that makes much sense. So I would appreciate your responses to those two issues that have come up as we have deal with the realities of the meltdown that we have experienced.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Well, I never comment on open, operating institutions, so I will try to address some of the issues in a generic way.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Yes, put them in a generic way.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Where an institution performs activities that have systemic significance so that if they just ceased and repudiated those obligations you would have a systemic situation. Congress long ago gave us the authority to set up a bridge bank to maintain functions that are perhaps profitable and have value, but also need to be continued to avoid systemic risk. This mechanism allows us to move good parts of an institution into a bridge bank, which then can be sold back to the private sector. The problem assets or other loans or securities that may be causing losses are retained in the receivership. This kind of generic situation is why bankruptcy does not work, because you do not have that bridge bank process. You do not have a way to continue these types of important systemic functions as you try to wind down and resolve the institution. We do not have this authority for holding companies. But we do have that kind of mechanism that we use now for banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","You are clearly right that there are several major financial institutions that are relied upon in financial markets for clearing and settlement, sort of the back-office plumbing. And if they were to get into various serious difficulty, that could be very disruptive, and so it could have certainly systemic repercussions. That has been a difficult issue to build an adequate response for in advance, although I would note that--gee, this was probably at least 15 years or so ago now--one of these institutions experienced a very serious computer glitch that threatened-- it threatened operations and threatened its liquidity position, and as I recall, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York loaned something like $20-some billion to it overnight to address that problem, and it was addressed effectively. But you are clearly right that this would be something that a systemic risk supervisor would want to take a careful look at.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Can you comment on the disparity between accounting mark-to-market and taxes?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","I am not knowledgeable about the tax situation, and like Chairman Bair, I am more than reluctant to comment about a particular institution. I would say that as far as mark-to-market accounting is concerned, it is not perfect; although, obviously, in more normal times, I think it works reasonably well. When some markets are not functioning, it is difficult to price assets, of course. But it is not clear that there is a preferable alternative, and it may be better to, on the margin at least, run the risk of overstating the problems rather than understating them.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think just, generally, having worked at Treasury, the inconsistency between tax rules and GAAP accounting rules and regulatory treatment has arisen in a lot of contexts. I am uncomfortable with commenting on tax policy. Those laws are out of my bailiwick. If I could go back to your first question, though, we had a bank closing on Friday, Silverton Bank. It was a banker's bank. It had a lot of correspondent accounts with many other banking institutions. It was systemic in its functions for those other institutions, so we set up a bridge to preserve those relationships as we try to market and unwind them over time. It is a good, real-life example of how the bridge bank mechanism works. If you would like a more detailed briefing, our staff would be happy to give it to you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Well, yeah. I would appreciate it. But there is no question, as I think you have said, that there is a systemic risk beyond just the safety and soundness of the bank, the function the bank performs. Mr. Chairman, I still am baffled, the idea that the federal government is injecting money into an institution to help keep it solvent, and at the same time, the federal government is taking money out of the same institution in the form of taxes to make sure they do not make a profit. Somehow that picture just does not compute for me.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Senator, we have all heard the death and taxes, the comments, and I think it is one more time being proven out. I am sorry. Ms. Bair?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Going forward--the situation is what it is, and I think steps were taken because there were no good alternatives going forward. I think, again, a resolution mechanism will get you out of this. So it would provide an orderly way, providing what we call open bank or open institution assistance. It would give you a mechanism where you do not have this kind of incongruity.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","If I could, Mr. Chairman. Do you ever consider or run in to a situation where a tax forgiveness would keep the institutions solvent so that you do not have to seize it? And if you did, would you have the authority to----","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","We do not. Our statute is very strict. In determining what is the least cost resolution, we may not consider tax benefits. So Congress has constrained us somewhat in that capacity. I can check and see if, prior to that, there were instances in the past where a change in tax policy would have kept the institution viable. But I will have to get back to you on that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","I know we have a second panel, but I have one more question for this panel, and I will ask my colleagues if they have any more questions, and we can move to the second panel. Interesting discussion earlier on resolution authority, and, clearly, I cannot speak for all the colleagues, I have seen a great deal of interest in expanding the FDIC's authority to look at bank holding companies. I guess two quick questions. One. Mr. Stern, if we were to move on that action independent of the overall financial modernization activities, what would be the push back, and would there be reluctance from the Fed of turning over a bank holding company's resolution authority to the FDIC? And are there other early warning signs that seems kind of, at least to me, logical that we take that step? Secondarily, perhaps for both Mr. Stern and Ms. Bair, if we were to expedite that independently of the overall financial modernization, would it have any--even before passage of such legislation, if we were to advance that, could it have any effect on the current crisis?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Well, I will try to be succinct about that. I, obviously, will not speak for the Federal Reserve as a whole. I think it could be constructive to accelerate that effort with regard to resolution authority, staying away from exactly who has responsibility for what, for the reasons that have already been covered here. The one thing that would concern me about that is it might reduce the urgency of taking other steps that might be appropriate and important and necessary as well. And I would be concerned that we might think that, well, that addresses the problem and we do not need to take actions down the road. And so, there may be a value in trying to put together a more comprehensive package that would attack the issues that are of concern here and achieve the objectives that we have been talking about today in a comprehensive way.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","There is a great deal of interest in taking on the comprehensive. I wonder if there were any, though, in this moment, at this moment of the crisis, an expedited effort to expand to at least the bank holding companies.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Stern","Yes. As I said, I think that would be constructive.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Could there be even the advancement of that type of legislation? Could that have any short-term, positive--","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","I think it could be an important catalyst, perhaps, for more fundamental restructurings or assets sales. It could serve as a wake-up call, to perhaps move things along a little faster.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","It might force some of our banks to move quicker into which assets they might be willing to dispose of.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Bair","Right. Well, in these smaller institutions, we find that it is a viable mechanism to use. Just having that there is a good catalyst to take more aggressive action, whether it is major changes or restructurings, or asset sales or just selling the whole institution, which is more practical with the small institution. I think, absolutely, just having the lever there can contribute to some very constructive activity.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Well, I hope Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby get a chance to weigh in on that. I would love to see their sense of whether expedited on that would make some sense. Again, we will go very quickly, if any other member wants to ask this panel. Senator Merkley? Okay. Then I would then thank the panel for their very productive testimony and, always, your good work. Thank you. And we will move now to the second panel. Recognizing we have some votes, I will go ahead, and as the panel is setting up, I will go through a few introductory comments. For our second panel, we will hear from Peter J. Wallison, the Arthur F. Burns Fellow in Financial Policy Studies at the American Enterprise Institute for Public Policy Research, where his research focuses on banking, insurance and Wall Street regulation. Previously, Mr. Wallison served as general counsel to the U.S. Treasury, the depository institution's Deregulation Committee, and as White House counsel to President Ronald Reagan. After Mr. Wallison, we will hear from the Honorable Martin Baily, Senior Fellow in Economics Studies at the Brookings Institution. Mr. Baily served as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisors during the Clinton Administration. Finally, we will hear from Mr. Raghuram R.J. Rajan, the Eric J. Gleacher Distinguished Service Professor of Finance, University of Chicago, Booth School of Business. He served as chief economist at the International Monetary Fund. His major research focuses in the role of finance, planning and economic growth. We were asked for Mr. Wallison to testify first, but we seem to be missing Mr. Wallison.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","He was here a minute ago.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","Mr. Wallison, you are up first. You have been appropriately introduced, and we have said great things about you in your absence, and we are anxious to hear your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","I appreciate it very much, Mr. Chairman. I am very pleased to have this opportunity to appear before the Committee. The chairman's letter of invitation asked four questions, and I have attempted to answer them in detail in my prepared testimony. I will try to summarize both the questions and my responses as follows. First, is it desirable or feasible to prevent institutions from becoming ``too big to fail''? I do not believe it is possible to identify in advance those institutions that are ``too big to fail'' because they pose systemic risk. Even if we could do that, the current condition of the heavily regulated banking sector shows that regulation is not an effective way to control growth or risk taking. Only the failure of a large commercial bank is likely to create the kind of systemic breakdown that we fear. Banks are special. Businesses and individuals rely on them for ready cash, necessary to meet payrolls, provide working capital, and pay daily bills. Small banks deposit funds in large banks. If a large bank should fail, that could cause a cascade of losses through the economy, and that is the definition, really, of systemic risk or a systemic breakdown. I doubt, however, that other kinds of financial institutions, insurance companies, securities firms, hedge funds, no matter what their size, can cause a systemic breakdown if they fail. This is because creditors of these firms do not expect to have immediate access to the funds that they have lent. If a large, non-bank financial firm should fail, its creditors suffer its losses over time with no immediate cascade of losses through the economy. The turmoil in the markets after Lehman's bankruptcy was the result of the extreme fragility of the world's financial system at that time and not the result of any losses actually caused by Lehman. The failure of a non-bank financial firm is not much different, in my view, from the failure of a large operating firm like General Motors. If General Motors fails, it will cause many losses throughout our economy, but not even the administration is contending that GM is ``too big to fail.'' The Committee should consider why if GM is not ``too big to fail,'' a large non-bank, financial firm might be; or if GM is ``too big to fail,'' whether we need a government agency that will resolve big operating firms, as some are proposing to resolve big financial firms. Second. Should firms that are ``too big to fail'' be broken up? This would not be good policy. Our large operating companies need large banks and other financial institutions for loans, for insurance, for funds transfers, and for selling their securities. If we broke up large financial institutions on the mere supposition that they might cause a systemic event, we would be depriving our economy of something it needs without getting anything certain in return. Third. What regulatory steps should be taken to address the ``too-big-to-fail'' problem? Since I do not think that non-bank financial institutions can create systemic risk, I would not propose new regulation for them at all. However, regulation of banks can be improved. We should require higher minimum capital levels. Capital should be increased during profitable periods when banks are growing in size. Regulators should develop indicators of risk taking and require banks to publish them regularly. This would assist market discipline. Fourth. How can we improve the current framework for resolving systemically important non-bank financial firms? There is no need to set up a government-run system for resolving non-bank financial institutions the way we resolve banks. They do not pose the risks that banks do. Giving an agency the power to take them over would virtually guarantee more bailouts like AIG with the taxpayers paying the bill. The bankruptcy system is likely to work better with greater certainty and with fewer losses. Within two weeks after its bankruptcy filing, Lehman had sold its investment banking, brokerage and investment advisory businesses to four different buyers. And unlike the $200 billion disaster at AIG, all Lehman's bankruptcy costs are being paid by the shareholders and the creditors of Lehman, not the taxpayers. Because of their special role in the economy, banks must have a special resolution system. I agree with that. But there is no reason to do the same thing for the creditors of non-bank financial institutions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF PETER J. WALLISON, ARTHUR F. BURNS FELLOW IN FINANCIAL POLICY STUDIES, AMERICAN ENTERPRISE INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC POLICY RESEARCH"
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Wallison. Some interesting comments. I am anxious to ask a couple of questions. Mr. Baily?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Thank you, Senator, and members of the Committee for giving me this opportunity. I am going to make a quick preamble and then get to the same questions that Peter was referring to. The U.S. economy has been in free-fall. Hopefully, the pace of decline is easing. But in order to get a transition back to sustained economic growth, that will not be possible without a restoration of the financial sector to health. In this situation, policymakers must deal with ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions because, at this time, we cannot afford to see the disorderly failure of another major financial institution that would exacerbate systemic risks and threaten economic recovery. The stress tests are being completed and some banks are being told how much extra capital they will need. However, I think there is a lot more to be done after that because large volumes of troubled or toxic acids remain on the books of the banks, and more such acids are being created as the recession continues. It is possible that one or more banks will become insolvent and will have to be taken over by the authorities. I think it would be a terrible mistake, however, any kind of preemptive nationalization of other banks. At the same time, getting the U.S. financial sector up and running is essential, will be very expensive, and is deeply unpopular with the electorate. If Americans want a growing economy next year with an improving labor market, I think Congress will have to provide more Treasury TARP funds maybe on a large scale. The cost of taxpayers in the country will be lower than a deeper recession and lower than nationalization. Let me turn now, specifically, to the questions that were asked. Should regulation prevent financial institutions from becoming ``too big to fail''? I tend to agree with Peter on this one. I think we actually need very large financial institutions. New York is really the center of the financial world, New York and London, and we need large-scale institutions to continue and sustain the process of globalization that I think contributes to global prosperity. Well, some of the institutions are going to end up being ``too big to fail,'' really, whether we like it or not. I do think ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions, or too interconnected institutions, can be regulated in a way that at least partially offsets the risks they pose to the rest of the financial system because of their status. We need better capital standards. They need to be increased progressively as a bank increases in size or another financial institution. And I think financial regulators should have special ability to look at these institutions to make sure that their portfolios are not unduly taking on too much risk. And I think there should also be some restrictions on bank mergers so that we are not creating more ``too-big-to-fail'' institutions than we need to have. In other words, ``too big to fail'' is sort of a necessary evil but not something that we should really like. Should the existing institutions be broken up? No, I do not think so, particularly if they have grown organically. If they have become efficient and grown, performing services for the U.S. and the global economy, I do not think there is a case for breaking them up. On the other hand, if we are--for example, if Sheila Bair is dealing with another bank failure, I think it certainly should be part of her mandate not to end up with creating a ``too-big-to-fail'' bank. Again, like the previous answer, we are stuck with ``too big to fail,'' but we certainly do not want more of them than we have to. Now, what requirements should be imposed on ``too-big-to- fail'' institutions? The one thing I would say about that is that if you are a ``too-big-to-fail'' institution, you have an advantage. Your borrowing costs are lower than they would be otherwise. Alan Greenspan at a meeting at Brookings suggested that that number was about 50 basis points. I think we need to take a good, hard look at what that number is because I think it actually gives us some room to impose on large banks certain additional regulations, additional capital requirements, additional supervision of their portfolios, certain things that we can do. You see, there is a concern that if you impose extra regulations on large banks, then they become uncompetitive, and then all of a sudden, activities migrate out of those banks. They go to the Caribbean or something like that. So we want these big banks to be carefully regulated, but at the same time not to have to pay an undue penalty that makes them uncompetitive. We do need improved resolution procedures. I would be happy to talk about that more. I know my colleague is going to say something about that. The final point I want to make in this--I will just say I endorse, by the way, the idea of this convertible debt. I think that is a good way of increasing the capital requirements for some of these large banks. The last point I want to make in my last second is essentially that this crisis, I believe, was a market failure and regulatory failure. And if we try to brand it one or the other, we are not going to find the right answer to the problem. Markets fail. People who had their own money at risk did stupid things and lost the money. So market incentives did not work the way we hoped they would. At the same time, we had rooms full of regulators regulating some of these banks, and they did not do their job either. So what we have to find going forward is a way of combining good, well-paid, well-trained regulators with good market incentives to try to improve this system in the future. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MARTIN NEIL BAILY, SENIOR FELLOW, ECONOMIC STUDIES, THE BROOKINGS INSTITUTION"
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Baily. Professor Rajan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, Senators, there is, in my view, a more important concern arising from this financial crisis than when private institutions are deemed ``too big to fail.'' Other than the reasons that have already been laid out, let me add one more. When systemically important institutions are bailed out, it is very hard for the authorities to refute allegations of crony capitalism, for the outcomes are observationally equivalent; after all, the difference is only one of intent. In this kind of system, the authorities do not want to bail out the systemically important institutions but are forced to, while in crony capitalism they do so willingly. The collateral damage in this system to public faith and free enterprise is enormous, especially when the public senses two sets of rules, one for the systemically important and another one for the rest of us. I have avoided saying ``too big to fail.'' That is because size, in my view, is neither necessary nor sufficient for an institution to be deemed too systemic to fail. Given my limited time, let me focus on how we can overcome the problems of too systemic to fail institutions in some measure. The three obvious possibilities: one, prevent institutions from becoming too systemic in the first place; second, create additional private sector buffers that keep them from failing; and, third, make it easier for the authorities to fail them when they do become truly distressed. Let me explain each in turn. I personally believe, like Mr. Baily does, that proposals to prevent institutions from expanding beyond a certain size or to significantly limit the activities of some institutions may be very costly without achieving their intent. Consider some economic costs. Some institutions get large not through unwise acquisitions but through organic growth based on superior efficiency. A crude size limit applied across the board will prevent the economy from benefiting from such institutions. Furthermore, size can imply greater diversification, which can reduce risk. Moreover, the threshold size can vary across activities and across time. A trillion dollar mutual fund family may not be a concern, while a $25 billion mortgage guarantor might well be. Finally, size itself is hard to define. Do we mean assets, gross derivative positions, net derivative positions, transactions or profitability? Given these difficulties, any legislation on size limits will have to give regulators substantial discretion. That creates its own problems. Similar issues arise with activity limits. What activities will be prohibited? Some suggest banning banks from proprietary trading, that is trading for their own account. But how would the law distinguish between illegitimate proprietary trading and legitimate risk-reducing hedging? Many of the activities that were prohibited to commercial banks under Glass-Steagall were peripheral to this crisis, and activities that did get banks into trouble, such as holding sub-prime mortgage-backed securities, would have been permissible under Glass-Steagall. Finally, regulating size or activity limits would be a nightmare because the regulator would be strongly tempted to arbitrage the regulations. I would suggest rather than focusing on these limits, we focus on creating stronger private-sector buffers in making institutions easier to fail. Now, the traditional buffer is capital, and I do agree that raising capital might be a good thing, but one should not put too much weight for reasons that have already been stated; in particular, that banks will tend to take more risks when they are asked to hold more capital. In some ways, I would rather advocate a more contingent buffer where systemically important institutions arrange for capital to be infused when the institution or the system is in trouble. And the difference between the two is quite important. As an analogy, additional capital is like keeping buckets full of water ready to douse a potential fire. As the years go by and the fire does not appear, the temptation is to use up the water. My contrast, contingent capital is like installing sprinklers. There is no water to use up, and when the fire threatens, the sprinklers actually turn on. One version of contingent capital, proposed by the nonpartisan Squam Lake Group, is for a portion of a bank's debt to be automatically converted to equity when two conditions are met: one, the system is deemed in crisis either based on regulatory assessments or based on objective indicators like the size of losses of the system; and, second, the bank's capital ratio falls below a certain value. There are other versions of contingent capital, such as requiring banks to purchase fail-safe insurance policies from unlevered institutions that will provide them an insurance payment when they are in trouble, and there are ways of structuring this that I would be happy to go into. Let me turn to the other possible remedy, making them easier to fail. And here I think that there are a number of issues that have been talked about, which makes banks hard to fail. I would suggest we also want to recruit banks in the process of making themselves easier to fail. And this is why I would suggest that banks also be subject to a requirement where they focus on creating a shelf bankruptcy plan, which would focus on how they themselves could be made easier to fail. For example, over time, the amount of time it will take to fail a bank could be reduced to such time as we could actually fail some of these large institutions, over a weekend. By putting this requirement and stress testing it at regular intervals, I think you would give banks an incentive to become less complicated, not to add layers of complexity in the capital structure or in the organization structure, and we could well get easier resolution.","Statement","STATEMENT OF RAGHURAM G. RAJAN, ERIC J. GLEACHER DISTINGUISHED SERVICE PROFESSOR OF FINANCE, UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO, BOOTH SCHOOL OF BUSINESS"
"Senator Warner","Thank you, sir. The vote has started, I think, about 10:56. I will try to ask two to three minutes worth, and then if Senator Bennett or Senator Merkley want to try to get it in before the vote. If not, we will go into recess. And I am not sure how many votes there are going to be, so we will have to have a little flexibility. Very quickly, without lots of extra commentary, Peter, I would love to hear your comment about not having the need in terms of a non-bank financial systemic risk regulator, where we deal with the AIGs of the world. For all of the panel, perhaps very briefly, Mr. Baily, Mr. Wallison, you both said we do not want to make a line in the sand about ``too big to fail,'' but, in effect, what we want to do is we want to try and stop more institutions from becoming ``too big to fail.'' At some point, if we are going to have additional capital requirements, or if we are going to have added insurance fees or other kinds of resolution fees, we are going to have make some definition. We are still going to be backed into a definition, are we not? Third, questions where we are saying we ought to allow these to grow organically. But some of the actions of, for example, the combination of Merrill and Bank of America, and some of the other things that have taken place in the last six months, I am not sure these would have all have been in the normal course of organic growth. And does that mean because of the crisis, we have to then live with these institutions that were, in effect, created out of the crisis? I know that is a lot. If you could keep your comments or answers fairly short, so, again, my colleagues may get a word in before we go to vote.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","Okay. Well, let me try first. I will go first, and let me just talk about two things. First, the idea of being backed into a definition, I think it is very dangerous for Congress to say to a regulatory agency, ``You make this choice,'' because the inclination of the regulatory agency under all circumstances will be to be very liberal--small ``L'' here--in choosing because they will get into trouble if some of that occurs and they have not put an institution within the charmed circle that would be regarded as a systemically important or a ``too-big-to-fail'' institution. So Congress has to be very specific, it seems to me, about what constitutes systemic risk, what is ``too big to fail,'' and under what circumstances it is possible for an agency to take them over in that sense. Now, AIG is a really great example of a lot of things, and we do not really have time to talk about it all. But AIG probably should have gone into bankruptcy, and if they had gone into bankruptcy--and I cover this in detail in my prepared statement. If they had gone into bankruptcy, there would not have been any substantial impacts throughout the rest of the economy. We also saw that Lehman did go into bankruptcy, and right after that, there was turmoil, but the reason for that is that the market was unprecedentedly fragile. I do not think we have ever seen, at least certainly in my lifetime, probably not since the Great Depression, a market where almost all of the financial institutions in the world were regarded as unstable and possibly insolvent. And when--and I think Gary Stern said this. When that institution failed, when Lehman was allowed to fail, suddenly everyone said, ``Oh, there is a different world out here because I had assumed,'' they said to themselves, ``after Bear Stearns that no large institution would be allowed to fail. I now have to look at all of the institutions I deal with.'' And that is why all the lending came to a halt. That was a classic case of moral hazard. And if we allow ourselves to get into a position where we are bailing out institutions like an AIG on a regular basis-- and if we give regulators the power to do it, they will do it-- then we will bring much more moral hazard into our economy. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","The Volcker Commission used this with SIFIs, or ``systemically important financial institutions,'' maybe that is a better word than ``too big too fail,'' but, anyway, certainly institutions in which there is a danger that the whole system will come down. How do you define that? I do not know the answer to that. I think it has to be done through guidelines provided by Congress with some discretion for the regulators. In terms of AIG going down and Lehman going down, I disagree with Peter fundamentally. I think we had to do what was done with AIG to prevent further repercussions. I do think that the failure of Lehman was a mistake, and I think most people looking back would agree that it would not have taken that much to prevent the disorderly collapse of Lehman, which had substantial impacts in London and other parts of the world. So I do think we do need to make sure not that shareholders benefits--because shareholders go down, as they should, but that some of the fallout from those institutions is prevented. You mentioned that we have sort of created these monsters now by putting together some of the banks. I think the Treasury and the Federal Reserve were acting quickly to try to deal with a very difficult crisis. I think with the benefit of hindsight, maybe it would not have been such a great idea to make Bank of America take over Merrill, or whatever. I think some of those mistakes--or some of those decisions that were made rather quickly were not always--may not have been the best ones. But in point of fact, we are now stuck with those institutions. They are SIFIs, and they have to be regulated with additional capital requirements and some of the additional requirements so that they do not pose systemic dangers.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","We are down to 7 minutes, and we have got to get over to the capital, so, Professor, briefly.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Very quickly, I think it is a mistake to identify systemically important institutions. Then you make the market actually treat them as systemically important and act accordingly. That is a problem. I think you can talk about systemically important. You can sort of have a broad definition. But, in general, regulations should not identify them and create a difference between systemically important and others. Perhaps you can have increasing capital requirements based on size, but it would not have to be capital requirements which suddenly change when you move from being an ordinary bank to becoming a systemically important bank. I think that will be the challenge that Congress has in devising regulations, how to deal with systemically important without actually identifying the specific institutions that are systemically important.","Speech"," "
"Senator Warner","If I heard correctly, I think you have all said, you know, this is very challenging, do not leave it to the regulator, and you better not mess up, Congress. Thank you. I think the Committee will stand in recess until we are finished voting.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","This hearing, Martin Baily, Raghuram Rajan and Peter Wallison, I will begin with you on questions to all of you. It is pretty clear that our current regulatory system failed to address the risks taken by many large financial organizations that resulted in the current economic crisis. It is equally clear that these companies grossly failed to manage their risks. And with all of this, we have been making every effort to deal with the problems they face and to try to stabilize the problems that we have. So, the second panel, I would like to ask you, should Congress impose a new regime that would simply not allow financial organizations to become too large or too complex, perhaps, by imposing strict size or activity restrictions? So let me first all on Mr. Wallison for your response.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","Yes. In my prepared testimony, Mr. Chairman, I said that that would not be a good policy to keep institutions from growing. My colleagues here, in answer to questions from the first part of this panel before we recessed, took fundamentally the same point, saying that, well, if an institution has gotten very large because it is very efficient and a good competitor, then it ought not to be penalized and broken up for that reason. I want to go just a little bit further and say that we have very large operating companies in this country. We are continuing to grow these operating companies. And large operating companies need--especially if they are operating globally, need large, globally operating banks. And if you try to imagine an oil company trying to pay all of its employees around the world on the same day, without a bank that can do all of that in every major area, you can see the kind of problem that arises. So I do not think it would be good policy to break up companies or keep them from getting larger if they are getting larger because they are competing well.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. Mr. Baily?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Thank you. First of all, I agree with you very much that we failed to address the risks and companies failed to manage their risks. One of the most interesting and revealing documents that I read in all of this was written by UBS, the Swiss Bank, at the insistence of the Swiss Central Bank, that described its own risk management procedures and how they had failed. And it is an extraordinary document of how they did not follow their own internal risk management. They jeopardized their own company. They subsequently had to be supported by the Swiss Central Bank, which in turn has had to rely, to some extent, on our federal reserve. It is an extraordinary story, which goes to the point that you mentioned. I agree with Peter, generally, in the remarks that he made, that we require these very large banks. When the crisis hit, for example, there was a huge collapse in global trade. Traders in India could not import and export because they had relied on financing coming through New York. So I agree with him very much that we need these large banks, particularly if they are growing and providing services to the U.S. and the global economy and are doing it efficiently. At the same time--and I think, again, we have some not complete agreement, but some broad agreement, that as banks become bigger or more interconnected--it is not always size, obviously--that we need special supervision, either increased cap requirements, increased supervision of their portfolios, or some mechanism to make sure that we do not get a repeat of what happened to UBS. Now, I do not think we are going to get that next year because I think a lot of people have learned their lesson. But we have to have in place a system that 10 years from now, 20 years from now, when some of these lessons have been forgotten, that we have in place a better regulatory regime. I would say one more thing about that regulatory regime. We cannot, probably in this country, ever pay regulators what people earn on Wall Street. Some countries pay their regulators very high salaries. There are limits to what we can do here. But I do think it would make a difference if we could pay reasonably competitive salaries, more than they are currently making. We should insist on training regulators so we give ourselves the best chance of avoiding some of the regulatory failures that happened in the course of this crisis. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much, Mr. Baily.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree substantially with my co-panelists that size limits are relatively crude, very hard to enforce, because there are also ways around it; very hard to determine ex ante for Congress through legislation. Similarly, with activities; again, activity limits, which products are you going to limit? The same product can be used in a good and purposeful way, and the same product can be used for taking on speculative risks of extraordinary levels. And so, given that intent is often what distinguishes a product used appropriately and a product used inappropriately, it is very hard to have legislation governing that. So anytime you go into size limits or activity limits, you are going to have to give a lot of discretion to regulators. And I think, as Mr. Baily pointed out earlier, regulators have to also cover themselves with a lot of glory during this crisis, and do we really want to put a lot of weight on their judgment. I think there is no magic bullet to this problem. I think it is a very serious problem. It is a problem we have to deal with. And there have been a number of suggestions that have been made by this panel. One I would re-emphasize is that in addition to trying to find ways to, perhaps, make activities a little safer and create some buffers, I think we should also make these institutions easier to fail. And that is a focus that is not present in much of the debate; that if we could make these institutions less complex, make their capital structures a little easier to resolve, I think that would go a long way in reducing the problem. One of the suggestions that I would like to emphasize is that if we try and enlist these institutions in preparing their own funeral plans, get them to talk about business termination, if the authorities had to close them down, how would the authorities go about it, and try and get them to start preparing these plans so that, in fact, when the authorities intervene, there is already a ready-made process. I think that would help us also in this. It would also force these institutions to stay away from excessively complicated structures or excessive derivative positions. And so, that could be part of the legislative agenda, prepare your own business termination plans or pre-packaged bankruptcy, which you have to negotiate and discuss with regulators on a periodic basis.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much for that. Let me give some time back to the panel to make any further comments that you would like to make on this. Mr. Wallison?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","Yes. I would like to just address one point that I think is fundamental here. And that is, we have to put some boundaries around what we mean by ``too big to fail.'' We have to make--Congress has to do something to give guidance to the regulatory agency. One of the worst things that could happen here, if legislation is adopted, is that we create a system in which companies that should fail are bailed out because the regulators decide that they are ``too big to fail.'' And since we do not know what is ``too big to fail,'' we have not really got a definition of that, we cannot even--we know that it is out there somewhere, but we cannot define it well. By giving regulatory agencies the opportunity to resolve, it is said, these institutions, they will say, in many cases, that the institution is ``too big to fail.'' And they will bail out that institution when it should have been allowed to fail. The result of that, I am afraid, is that whenever an institution that should have been allowed to fail continues in life a bad business model and a bad management, is there to continue operating, when if it had disappeared, better management and better business models would have come up to replace it. So we weaken our entire competitive system if we do not allow institutions that should fail to fail.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. Mr. Baily?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Thank you. First of all, let me talk about the context under which an institution becomes ``too big to fail'' or where we decide that it cannot be just allowed to fail. I have studied the automobile industry over a number of years, and if you had asked me a few years ago if one of our big automobile companies gets into trouble, should we let it fail, I would have said let it go down. I am not going to name names, but I think there were a lot of failures of management, of workers, of technology. So, you know, let the market work. When that same question came up in the last year, with great reluctance, when I was asked that question, I said, no, I do not think we can allow a disorderly bankruptcy of some of our largest automobile companies. And it is not because I wanted to do that; it is because we are in a time of economic crisis, and I felt that such a bankruptcy at that time would have brought the economy down. So, again, in the case of banks, there may be circumstances under which even quite large banks can be allowed to fail. And so I agree very much with the sentiment that we would like to have kind of plans in place for how we resolve large banks, allow them to fail. I do not think they can go through the normal bankruptcy process, but they go through a process in which they either go to the FDIC or resolved if they are bank holding companies. Now, Raghuram has made the suggestion, which he did in a very interesting article in The Economist, that we should have these funeral plans, that the banks should set up their own funeral plans. So they should be required to say, if we go broke, here is how you should go about regulating us. I have to say I was a bit skeptical in a comment that I made on that. It is sort of not the way businesses really work. Maybe you could do it, but I think it is probably more up to the regulators, maybe with some insistence from the banks, in figuring out if you do have these very large institutions, how interconnected are they, what are the counterparties to some of their positions, and what would be necessary; can we, in fact, let them go down under normal times without getting lots of taxpayer money caught up in this.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Mr. Rajan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Yes. The one comment I will make is it seems to me that the one concern is that a number of institutions, and the way they structure their activities, essentially make themselves ``too big to fail.'' And that is why I think you want to give them incentives not to become that way. Let me give an example. One of the reasons we worried about these large banks is the destruction of the payment and settlement system that happens when we fail these banks. Well, there are intricate ways in which the liability system of these banks is tied to the payment and settlement system. Right? One example is derivative contracts, which come due and have to be replaced if, in fact, the bank cannot make good on its debt. When you reduce the value of the debt, immediately, there is a consequence to the derivative contracts that the bank is involved in. These kinds of connections, interconnections, actually make the bank essentially too complicated, ``too big to fail.'' And my suggestion of forcing them to think about their own demise and proving to regulators that they could be closed in a relatively short time period--a weekend was just a number out of the box; but in a week, I think the rationale for that is you want to give these banks an incentive to think about not making themselves excessively complicated. And one way to do it is to put the onus on them to make their structures more simple, their liability structures, their organizational structures, so that when the regulator actually comes to unwind this bank, they have a less complicated entity to deal with. It is not going to be the answer by itself, and I think we need a lot of proposals on the table to do it, but it could be one piece of what we need.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. This next question is for the panel, again, and has to do with about setting standards. A lot of commentators criticize our capital standards as being pro-cyclical, demanding that financial companies raise expensive capital at the worst possible times and too little capital in good times. What are your views on having regulators set standards that require banks and other financial companies to build capital when the economy is strong as a cushion to weather the downturns? Mr. Wallison?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","I will take that first, I think. My view is-- first of all, I do not--in my prepared testimony and in my oral testimony, I said that I thought that banks were the only organizations that really required serious regulation for a variety of reasons. They can create systemic risk, but I do not think others can. On the question of this capital, what we do about banks that are growing and yet they still have the same amount of capital, which increases their leverage, I am one who does believe that we ought to increase capital requirements as growth occurs. As profitability and growth occurs, capital should go up so that it can perform the function that it was supposed to perform, which is as a buffer for the bad times. I think we are seeing today that the 10 percent risk-based capital requirement that was imposed in the United States under Basel I and Basel II, for well capitalized, was insufficient. Banks should have had more capital. But in addition, they should have added to their capital positions as a percentage, as they have grown larger and larger, and as they have more and more profits. That is something that we could very profitably do. And as a matter of fact, it would also go some distance to addressing this question of institutions getting too large and complex, because if additional capital requirements are imposed on them as they get larger and more complex, they will not get larger and more complex. They will make a judgment about what they have to do to be profitable rather than just getting larger.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Mr. Baily?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","I agree with much of what Peter said. I think we do need to increase capital requirements, and capital needs to play its role as a buffer. When there is a loss of assets, then the capital goes down, and now the capital that is left should be enough still to satisfy, certainly, the markets and the regulators, who are taking the appropriate cyclical view of capital that the bank is still an adequate position. So I think we do need to raise capital requirements and allow it to work appropriately as a buffer. One concern about capital is that many of our banks are competing internationally. Even before this crisis, there were many complaints that I heard, I think correctly, that U.S. banks were required--not the investment banks, that U.S. banks were required to hold more capital than European or other banks, and were having difficulty competing globally. So I think this is something that needs to be done with some degree of level cooperation. I say that cautiously because global cooperation on financial regulation has been difficult to do and has not worked very well. But I think this is an area we need to at least try to keep the playing field level in terms of capital. So higher capital requirements. It is not just capital requirements, though, obviously, because--so you had 20 percent capital requirement, but you had all these sub-prime mortgages, and that probably might not well have saved you. So I think it is a matter of--and in other cases where there was people borrowing--well, banks were borrowing at overnight rates or one-week rates and issuing mortgages on the other side of that, as Northern Rock in the UK did, for example. So it is a combination of more capital, some reasonable level of match so that there is not too much of a mismatch on the balance sheet, and the quality of the portfolio. So those combinations of things I think we need to do.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Mr. Rajan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","This is probably where I part a little with my fellow panelists. I think that capital can do a little bit. I would be skeptical about putting too much weight on it. And the reason is simply that the market in good times is very tolerant of institutions that have very high levels of leverage. As you know, some banks had 30, 40 to 1 leverage. Some investment banks had that kind of leverage. The market was willing to tolerate very low levels of capital. When the market is willing to tolerate those very low levels of capital, somebody who is sitting on a lot of capital has an incentive to undertake actions, which will reduce that level of capital relative to the activities they are taking. One example of such actions include creating off-balance sheet vehicles, which banks did a lot of. The SIVs and the conduits are examples. A second example of that kind of activity is for banks to take up risks, which is not penalized. UBS did that when it took on all these sub-prime mortgages on its balance sheet. So I think capital can help a little, but I think that banks, if the market does not require them to hold a lot of capital, banks are going to offset the capital requirement in ways that the regulator will not see. Moreover, this notion that in down times, banks can reduce the level of capital because the regulator allows them to, I am skeptical about that also because in times like these, this is when the market has taken fright. This is when the market wants banks to hold much higher levels of capital. Whatever the regulators say, the markets are going to dominate. And so, banks are going to raise their capital levels at this point, which is why you see this extreme level of de-leveraging taking place in the market, in the banking sector. So my sense is capital requirements which go against what the market wants are going to have limited effect. They will have some effect, no doubt, but let's not be overly convinced about the effect it will have.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Baily","Can you allow me just to respond to that? Because I think it is a very interesting question, and I do not think I have all the answers by any means. But, presumably, if you set a high enough level of capital in the good times, then when the losses come in, the bank capital goes down. But if you have started high enough, you still have enough capital left to satisfy the market that you are still sold on. That is the idea of having high capital levels in good times. By the way, I agree with you, you need other things besides capital.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Mr. Rajan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","I agree that they could have some effect. But my point is when you set capital requirements at 20 percent of bank assets, they are going to do a lot of things, which you will be surprised about in bad times because those SIVs, they have created the conduits. It will all come back on balance sheets at that point, and you will find that even the 20 percent is not enough. That is one. The second is we also have to worry about costs. When you ask banks, which are naturally funded with debt, to take on a lot of capital, intermediation is also going to suffer. I mean, I agree with you. You could have some benefits, but maybe not that much.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. Speaking about capital and ensuring adequate capital, Mr. Rajan raises the idea of having large, complex financial companies buy capital insurance plans or issue bonds that will convert to equity if capital deteriorates as a way to guard against the failure of these institutions. Mr. Rajan, can you elaborate on this idea?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Well, this follows on the comments I just made, which is that if capital on the balance sheet is not going to work that well because banks will find ways to offset it, maybe the idea is to get capital which comes only in bad times. It might be cheaper to arrange for that kind of capital rather than have capital sitting on balance sheets through good times and bad times. And if you can do it in a clever enough way, banks will not be able to exploit that capital and take on more risks a priori, given that they know that capital will come in. So two examples of how this could be done. One, which Mr. Baily has also talked about, which comes from a common group that we work in, is this idea of what is called reversed convertible debt. And this convertible debt is debt which will convert into equity in times like the current ones. So it is a pre-assured source of buffer which will protect the taxpayer from having to fund these institutions. And that debt will convert, provided the bank's capital ratio goes below a certain level. That is one condition. The second condition is that this be a systemic crisis so that banks do not sort of willfully convert this debt and get additional buffers. Another variant of this would be what we call the capital insurance plan, which is you issue bonds, which are called capital insurance bonds. The bank issues these bonds. The proceeds from the bonds are taken and invested in Treasuries. And the holders of these bonds get the Treasury rate of return plus an insurance premium, which the banks pays. In bad times, when the bank's capital goes below a certain level and there is a systemic crisis, the bonds will start, essentially, paying out to the bank. It would be equity at that point for the bank, and the bank would be recapitalized. So the main difference is, in one, the bonds convert to equity; in the other, the bonds just pay in. There is no commensurate equity, which is issued. Both have the effect of recapitalizing the bank in bad times.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. Further comment, Mr. Wallison?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Wallison","I think what Raghu has said is a very interesting proposal. I have this concern, however. And if we keep our eye on the ball, we are talking about systemic risk. And what is systemic risk? Systemic risk is the risk that when a large financial institution fails, a large bank fails, it has effects on all others throughout the economy, or many others, a contagion, if you will, a cascading of losses. The idea that we would convert debt into equity is good for the bank, but you have to consider what it does to the holders who previously had debt and now have equity; what it does to their balance sheets and what it does to their risk profiles. And what it does, of course, it make them much more risky. So in other words, in a time when we are talking about trying to prevent systemic risk, we are also thinking favorably about an idea that, actually, encourages, increases the possibility of contagion from a failed institution or a failing institution, to institutions that might otherwise be healthy.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","Could I respond?","Speech"," "
"Senator  Akaka","Mr. Rajan?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Rajan","The quick response is this is a clear problem that Mr. Wallison has pointed out. And the answer is that the holders of this debt should not be levered financial institutions. It should not be other banks. It should not be insurance companies. So who would hold? It would be un-levered financial institutions, such as pension funds, mutual funds, sovereign wealth funds. Now, the immediate question, then, is, well, is there any evidence that there are people who buy this kind of instrument? And the answer is yes. There is a very liquid market in credit- default swaps on bank debt. That credit-default swap on bank debt has exactly the properties of the kind of insurance we are talking about. That is, it pays out when the bank is doing really badly, which typically is when the economy is in trouble. And there are people who are willing to buy this instrument, so much so, that this market has gone beyond bounds. It has become extremely large and we are trying to contain it. But it is suggesting demand is not going to be a problem if we do this right. And we can try and regulate so that the costs are borne by financial institutions that are not levered. And the costs are not forced to be borne by the taxpayer, which, to my mind, is worse than getting some people who bear it, knowing that they have been paid for bearing that risk.","Speech"," "

"Mr. Baily","I like this proposal. Obviously, we have jointly put our names to it. I think it is possible that there could be more severe kinds of systemic crises in which the convertible capital would not be adequate, in which case we do need to go to other procedures, processes, for orderly resolution of some of these institutions. But I think having this kind of capital would make that less likely and make the system more stable.","Speech"," "
"Senator Akaka","Well, I want to thank you so much. This has been stimulating to hear from you. And it, certainly, without question, will help the Committee in its legislative efforts here. I want to thank our witnesses for joining us today. I want you to know that the hearing record will remain open for a week for statements from members or questions that members may have. Thank you again. This hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
