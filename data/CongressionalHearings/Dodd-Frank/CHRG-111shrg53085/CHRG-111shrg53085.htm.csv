"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Good morning, everyone, and welcome to the Senate Banking Committee. Let me welcome my colleagues and our witnesses and the guests who are here in the audience. We appreciate your presence here this morning. This morning we will hold what amounts to our eighth full Committee hearing on the subject matter of modernization of Federal regulations. Today, we are talking about the modernization of bank supervision and regulation. This morning I want to welcome our witnesses. We have got a very distinguished panel of witnesses who are here to share some thoughts with us. We are going to again explore ways in which we will try to modernize and improve bank regulation and supervision to better protect consumers and restore confidence in our banking system. We do so at a time when our country's massive challenges loom very large indeed. All of us in the Congress of the United States, Democrats and Republicans alike, are trying to work together to meet these challenges and restore public confidence in our financial institutions. In the coming weeks, we will be working on critical legislation to lay out a long-term budget blueprint to address our continuing financial crisis and to address the issue of executive compensation. As we continue to address the economic crisis going forward, I think it is important we recognize that not all banks are responsible for this crisis. Quite the contrary. And as Chairman Bernanke has said only recently, small bank lending might very well help lead the way out of this crisis in many places. None of this is to suggest that small banks do not face economic troubles of their own, of course. Some do, and on an almost weekly basis, we hear stories about how the FDIC takes over banks and works to reassure depositors that their money will be safe. But it would be a mistake to paint every financial institution with the same broad brush, and as I have heard from community banks around my State of Connecticut, many of our community banks are in far better shape right now than the financial system is as a whole. Why? Well, in part because when the financial institutions align their practices and incentives with their long-term health, they are far less prone to engage in riskier behavior. They are far less likely to put their companies and the economic security of the American consumer at risk. Former Fed Chairman Greenspan believes companies would not take such extraordinary risks, because their own survival could be in jeopardy. Clearly, he was wrong, and that assumption cost the American people dearly. Some of that failure can be attributed to the prevailing ideology of the moment, ranging from the abusive terms mortgage lenders offered to the practices credit card companies still engage in. Many of us believe that if we had failed to protect the consumer, we failed to protect our economy. Others felt, of course, just the opposite. Many of us believed that if we had skin in the game, we would all take the consequences of our actions more seriously. Others were confident risk could be managed. Today, it is clear that consistent regulation across our financial architecture is paramount, and that with strong cops on the beat in every neighborhood, institutions would be far less likely to push risk onto the consumer. Regulators are the first line of defense for consumers and depositors, which is why we need to end the practice of shopping for the most lenient regulator and consider creating a single coordinated prudential regulator. In a crisis created first and foremost by our failure to protect consumers, we cannot afford to consider a so-called systemic risk regulator without also considering how we can better protect the consumers. All too often in this crisis, we saw that the relationship between the consumer and their financial institutions was, in effect, severed because of a lack of incentives to ensure loans are paid off down the road. That was not true of smaller institutions like those in my State and those of my colleagues' here. Like so many credit unions and community banks, they recognized something very simple: that your company reaps the benefits when you treat your customers fairly. With this hearing, I hope we can take a close look at how these values can be the building blocks for a modernized 21st century financial architecture in our country. That must be our goal, not only today but in the coming weeks, as we are charged with the responsibility of modernizing the Federal financial regulations. With that, let me turn to Senator Shelby, and then I will quickly turn to my colleagues for any comments they want, and then we will go to our witnesses.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, thank you for calling this hearing. I know we are holding a series of hearings here to build a record, and I think you are leading the way. I have an opening statement I would like to be made part of the record, and with that, I would like to, as soon as we can, get to the witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY

"Senator Bunning","I will be brief, but I wanted to highlight a few points I made in the statement I put in the record for Thursday's hearing last Thursday. We all want to make changes that will make failure less likely to happen and the system strong enough to survive when failures do happen. I was impressed by Mr. Whalen's written testimony today. Among other things, it supports the concerns that I have stated many times, and I believe the Chairman and others on this Committee share, about the Fed's willingness and ability to regulate banks or overall risk. We do not need to give the Fed more power. I am going to repeat that: We do not need to give the Fed more power because they are no longer an independent agency. They are just part of the big group that is overseeing financial institutions along with writing legislation with the Treasury Secretary. Just creating a new regulator or two will not really add to stability. In fact, it just might create a false sense of security and a whole new class of firms that will expect Government bailouts if they make bad decisions. Congress and regulators cannot stop bad decisions or economic problems. Banks and other financial firms will fail in the future. While we want to try to prevent failure, it is at least as important to make sure the system can handle failure so there will be no temptation to bail out firms in the future. As Mr. Whalen points out, probably the most important thing we can do for stability is make sure regulators have the rules and powers in place to close failing firms in a quick but controlled manner. If we do not do that, markets will know the future Citigroups and AIGs of the world will not bring down the entire system. And market participants will act more responsibly because they know they will bear the consequences of their action. That will go a long way in creating a more stable system. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Yes, thank you, Mr. Chairman. Quickly, first, I appreciate the hearing and appreciate you folks coming. I look forward to hearing your suggestions as we look for ways to instill consumer confidence and to promise stability in the--not in the marketplace, but in the banking institutions themselves. I would just say this: My main concern with modernization at this point in time is the impact, if handled improperly, on community banks and credit unions. I think that these folks are the lifeblood, especially where I come from in rural America. Last Saturday, as almost on a weekly basis personally, on a daily basis with my staff, we hear from community banks and credit unions about the issues that are impacting them right now, like premiums on deposit insurance, additional regulation on loan standards that really cuts back on their flexibility to get money out the door to local communities. And I would hope that whatever regulation we come up with will do what it is intended to do and not really hinder the folks who have really played by the rules and done a good job protecting their depositors and the folks they lend money to. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JON TESTER

"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate that very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just want to echo what some of my colleagues have quickly said so we can get to the witnesses. But I appreciate you holding this hearing because I sometimes think particularly the media paints with a broad brush that everybody in the financial industry has been taking inappropriate actions. And the fact that today we are going to highlight some of the folks who are continuing to work through these challenging economic times and have not taken on some of the actions that got the industry in trouble is a good hearing for us, but it is also a good hearing for the public at large.

"Senator Schumer","I would ask that my entire statement be put in the record. I just want to make three quick points in reference to some of the testimonies. First, in reference to Mr. Mica's testimony, I think it is really important we look for more places for small businesses to get loans. Banks are not doing it right now. And one of the things I will be asking you to comment upon is legislation that we are putting in. I think it was in 1996 we said that credit unions could only do 12 percent of their lending to small business. I have scores, maybe hundreds, probably thousands of businesses in my area that cannot get loans or are actually having lines of credit pulled from them by banking institutions. I have credit unions that would like to lend to these businesses and prevent them--they are profitable, ongoing businesses--from going under, and the credit unions cannot lend because of the cap. I think we ought to lift it, and I will be putting in legislation on that. In reference to Mr. Whalen, having a unitary regulator makes a great deal of sense. Right now, banks can choose their regulators, oftentimes. You know, that is sort of like picking the umpire, and then having the umpire get paid more the more he is picked. We know what would happen. Senator Bunning knows best of all. The strike zone would expand. The calls would be different. And it would not work. And, finally, Ms. Hillebrand, I just wanted to point out Senator Durbin and I have introduced legislation to have a Financial Product Safety Commission. I think that is really important. That avoids the cracks in regulation that Mr. Whalen has talked about because if the product is regulated, not who issues it, you are not going to have mortgage brokers getting around the banks, which is what happened before. So I think that is important to do, and with that I would just ask that my entire statement be entered into the record.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. SCHUMER 
"Chairman Dodd","That will certainly be the case, and true of all of our colleagues here and true of our witnesses as well. Any supporting documents or information you think would be helpful to the Committee will be included in the record. Let me welcome our witnesses this morning. Our first witness is Dan Mica, a former colleague of ours, a former U.S. Member from the House, currently President and CEO of the Credit Union National Association. Our next witness is William Attridge, and I welcome my constituent to the Banking Committee. Mr. Attridge is the President and CEO of the Connecticut River Community Bank. We are pleased to have you before the Committee this morning. Thank you for being here. Mr. Aubrey Patterson, is the Executive Chairman and CEO of BancorpSouth. He serves as Chairman of the American Bankers Association, and we welcome you as well to the Committee. Mr. Richard Christopher Whalen is Senior Vice President and Managing Director of Institutional Risk Analytics. Mr. Whalen has worked in a variety of capacities, including the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, where he worked in the Bank Supervision and Foreign Exchange Departments. And, last, we will hear from Gail Hillebrand, who is a senior attorney at the West Coast office of Consumers Union where she manages credit and finance advocacy teams and leads the Consumers Union Financial Services Campaign. We thank all five of you for being with us this morning. We will begin with you, Congressman Mica, and we would ask each of you to try and keep your remarks to about 5 or 6 minutes, if you can, so we can get to the questions. Welcome to the Banking Committee, Congressman Mica.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman and Ranking Member Shelby and Members of the Committee. Let me just say that I will dispense with my written and oral testimony, try to summarize it to give you plenty of time for questions. I have heard in advance that several have to leave, so I am going to try to summarize very quickly. First and foremost, we believe in strong, fair, competent, tough Federal regulators for all financial institutions. It does no good to the industry to have a regulator that rolls over. We all pay. Taxpayers pay, the consumers pay, and ultimately industry pays. So we start out that we do need some good, solid, tough, fair, and competent regulation. And before I go into the other points, I think I need to hit a major point that is facing us right now, and you may have read the headlines over the weekend. Our Federal regulator took over two--into conservatorship two of our corporate credit unions. And I want to put this in perspective. We have 8,000 credit unions in the United States with 90 million members-- 8,000, 90 million members. We have 28 corporates where they put excess funds for liquidity and so on, a liquidity facility. One of those is a central corporate where the other corporates put money. And it was two of those corporates that the regulator took over. And it is interesting. Some people said, well, they should not have put money into these mortgage-backed securities. According to what the regulators have advised me just the other day when they took this over, all those securities were AAA or AA when they bought them. So the surrounding economy has created a problem for two of our wholesale credit unions, and that will impact all of us. And we will back to you and I know the regulator will be back to you to deal with the waterfall of that. We will probably be seeking, much like the banks, an 8- year period of payback. We are not looking for a bailout but a payback. So we can pay that amount back that we have to refund the insurance fund over a period of time rather than in 1 year. Our legislation for credit unions, unlike the banks, makes us pay in 1 year. But I want to say this very clearly, that all of you here and anybody that is writing about credit unions, or talking: The 8,000 credit unions, the 90 million members, they are safe, they are sound. They have almost 11 percent capital, and every account is insured up to $250,000--every federally insured account. There are about 100, 200 credit unions that have private insurance. But the best institutions in the United States, we think, to put your money in right now, and the safest. But I wanted to address that because I know there were some concerns. So back to the fair, competent, strong, independent regulator. Essentially, the bottom line is credit unions are different than other institutions. We are not-for-profit. This is what you wrote in the law that defines a credit union, five things. You have to be not-for-profit, that is, 100 percent. And we are not like banks. We do not have shareholder stockholders. We are democratically operated 100 percent. We have volunteer boards, not paid boards like the banks. We have a special mission to provide consumers, and especially those of modest means, with credit and savings needs, consumers and those of modest means, not just those with modest means. We are virtually 100 percent on all of those. Our regulator does a good job. We have come out of this worst crisis since the Depression. And, by the way, credit unions were born of the Depression in the 1930s because everybody else was failing. We have a good regulator who understands the nuances and the problems that are attendant and much different than the for-profit system. If we had a separate regulator--and we have tried that in the past, in the 1930s, in the 1960s and 1970s. Each time we are essentially being put into the--it would be the chicken being put into the fox lair because the banking industry, the for-profit industry has either been oblivious to the needs of credit unions or, as you all know, they are very harsh about our existence. They feel that we may not have a place in our financial services system, and they try to write our rules. So you all know that, and we feel that unless we keep a separate Federal regulator--and that does not mean we love everything our regulator does, by any means. But if we keep a separate Federal regulator, we indeed would have a future in this country. So there are many things we can do, Chairman. Mr. Schumer mentioned member business lending. If we could get that cap raised, we could $10 billion with no Government assistance in small business loans and little America Main Street tomorrow. So, Mr. Chairman, I believe I am about out of time. I would just simply say this: I know there are questions about a consumer provision that was mentioned here. We again think that credit unions should not have to bear an undue burden, because we are not a part of that problem. Our members own our institutions. We do not abuse ourselves. And we think that all that needs to be taken into account as we look at what we are doing here. Yes, systemic regulation needs to be looked at, and while you are doing it, you might look at the rating agencies, too, and the ``too big to fail'' policy, because all those have played a part that we have all suffered collateral damage in. But we think you are on the right course. We look forward to working with you, and we thank you for the opportunity.",Statement,STATEMENT OF DANIEL A. MICA, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, CREDIT UNION NATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Mr. Attridge, welcome.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, my name is Bill Attridge. I am President and Chief Executive Officer of Connecticut River Community Bank. My bank is located in Wethersfield, Connecticut, a 375-year-old town with about 27,000 people. Our bank opened in 2002 and has offices in Wethersfield, Glastonbury, and West Hartford--all suburbs of Hartford. We have 30 employees and about $185 million in total assets at this time. We are a full-service bank, but the bank's focus is on lending to the business community. I am also a former President of the Connecticut Community Bankers Association. I am here to represent the Independent Community Bankers of America and its 5,000 member banks. ICBA is pleased to have this opportunity to testify today, and ICBA commends your bold action to address the current issues. Mr. Chairman, community bankers are dismayed by the current situation. We have spent the past 25 years warning policymakers of the systemic risk by the unbridled growth of the Nation's largest banks and financial firms. But we were told we did not get it, that we didn't understand the new global economy, that we were protectionist, that we were afraid of competition, and that we needed to get with the ``modern'' times. However, our financial system is now imploding around us. It is important for us to ask: How did this happen? And what must Congress do to fix the problem. For over three generations, the U.S. banking regulatory structure has served this Nation well. Our banking sector was the envy of the world and the strongest and most resilient financial system ever created. But we got off track. Our system has allowed--and even encouraged--the establishment of financial institutions that threaten our entire economy. Nonbank financial regulation has been lax. The crisis illustrates the dangerous overconcentration of financial resources in too few hands. To address this core issue, we recommend the following. Congress should require the financial agencies to identify, regulate, assess, and eventually break up institutions posing a risk to our entire economy. This is the only way to protect taxpayers and maintain a vibrant banking system where small and large institutions are able to fairly compete. Congress should reduce the 10-percent cap on deposit concentration. Congress should direct the systemic risk regulator to block any merger that would result in the creation of a systemic risk institution. An effective systemic risk regulator must have the duty and authority to block activity that threatens systemic risk. Congress should not establish a single, monolithic regulator for the financial system. The current structure provides valuable regulatory checks and balances and promotes best practices among those agencies. The dual banking system should be maintained. Multiple charter options, both Federal and State, are essential preserve an innovative and resilient regulatory system. Mr. Chairman, we do not make these recommendations lightly, but unless you take bold action, you will again be faced with a financial crisis brought on by mistakes made by banks that are too big to fail, too big to regulate, and too big to manage. Breaking up systemic risk institutions while maintaining the current regulatory system for community banks recognizes two key facts: first, our current problems stem from overconcentration; and, second, community banks have performed well and did not cause the crisis. ICBA also believe nonbank providers of financial services, such as mortgage companies and mortgage brokers, should be subject to greater oversight for consumer protection. The incidence of abuse was much less pronounced in the highly regulated banking sector. Many of the proposals in our testimony are controversial, but we feel they are necessary to safeguard America's great financial system and make it stronger coming out of this crisis. Congress should avoid doing damage to the regulatory system for community banks, a system that has been tremendously effective. However, Congress should take a number of steps to regulate, assess, and ultimately break up institutions that pose unacceptable systemic risks to the Nation's financial system. ICBA looks forward to working with you on this very important issue, and we appreciate this opportunity to testify.",Statement,STATEMENT OF WILLIAM R.

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and you have raised some very challenging questions, good questions. We thank you for that as well. Mr. Patterson, welcome to the Committee.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Thank you, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. My name is Aubrey Patterson, Chairman and CEO of BancorpSouth, Inc. Our company operates over 300 commercial banking, mortgage, insurance, trust and broker-dealer locations throughout six Southern States. I am pleased to testify on ABA's recommendations for a modernized regulatory framework. I might add that ABA does represent over 95 percent of the assets of the industry. Recently, Chairman Bernanke gave a speech which focused on three main areas: first, the need for a systemic risk regulator; second, the need for a method for orderly resolution of a systemically important financial firm; and, third, the need to address gaps in our regulatory system. We agree that those three issues should be the priorities. This terrible crisis should not have been allowed to happen again, and addressing these three areas is critical to ensure that it does not. ABA strongly supports the creation of a systemic regulator. In retrospect, it is inexplicable that we have not had such a regulator. If I could use a simple analogy, think of the systemic regulator as sitting on top of Mount Olympus looking out over all of our land. From that highest point, the regulator is charged with surveying the land looking for fires. Instead, we currently have had a number of regulators each of which sits on top of a smaller mountain and only sees its relative part of the land. Even worse, no one is looking over some areas, creating gaps in the process. While there are various proposals as to who should be the systemic regulator, much of the focus has been on giving the authority to the Federal Reserve. There are good arguments for looking to the Fed. This could be done by giving the authority to the Fed or by creating an oversight committee chaired by the Fed. ABA's one concern in using the Fed relates to what it may mean for the independence of that organization. We strongly believe in the importance of Federal Reserve independence in its role in setting and managing monetary policy. ABA believes that systemic regulation cannot be effective if accounting policy is not in some fashion part of the equation. To continue my analogy, the systemic regulator on Mount Olympus cannot function well if part of the land is strictly off limits and under the rule of some other body, a body that can act in a way that contradicts the systemic regulator's policies. That is, in fact, exactly what has happened with mark-to-market accounting. ABA also supports creating a mechanism for the orderly resolution of systemically important nonbank firms. Our regulatory bodies should never again be in the position of making up an impromptu solution to a Bear Stearns or an AIG or not being able to resolve a Lehman Brothers. The inability to deal with these situations in a predetermined way greatly exacerbated the crisis. A critical issue in this regard is ``too big to fail.'' The decision about the systemic regulator and a failure resolution system will help determine the parameters of ``too big to fail.'' In an ideal world, there would be no such thing as too big to fail, but we all know that the concept not only exists it has, in fact, broadened over the last few months. This concept has profound moral hazard and competitive effects that are very important to address. The third area for focus is where there are gaps in regulation. Those gaps have proven to be major factors in this crisis, particularly the role of unregulated mortgage lenders. Credit default swaps and hedge funds also should be addressed in legislation to close gaps. There seems to be a broad consensus to address these three areas. The specifics will be complex and, in some cases, contentious. But at this very important time, with Americans losing their jobs, their homes, and their retirement savings, all of us should work together to develop a stronger, more effective regulatory structure. ABA pledges to be an active and constructive participant in this critical effort. I would be happy to answer any questions, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF AUBREY B. PATTERSON, CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, BANCORPSOUTH, INC., ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Patterson. We appreciate your testimony. Mr. Whalen, welcome.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, Members of the Committee, I am going to summarize my written comments and go down a list in bullet fashion, if you will, to respond to some of your comments and some of the other testimony. Systemic risk--does it exist? I am not sure. I used to work for Gerry Corrigan. I watched it in its early formations. Read the paper on my Web site called ``Gone Fishing,'' by the way. It is an allusion to his pastime with Chairman Volcker. What I would urge you to do is talk about systemic risks, make it plural, because then you are going to focus everybody on what we need to focus on, which are what the components that cause people to talk about systemic risk. A synonym for ``system risk'' is ``fear.'' If you go back to the Corrigan Group's work, you will see they differentiate between market disturbances and systemic events. Market disturbances are when people are upset, unsure about pricing, stop answering the phone. Systemic risk is when you are not getting paid. That is the difference. And if the Congress would focus on what are the components that cause us to talk about systemic risk, then I think we will make progress. The role of the Fed: I have great admiration and respect for every one of my colleagues in the Federal Reserve System, especially for the people in bank supervision. But the Congress has to accept and understand that monetary economists are entirely unsuited to supervise financial institutions. In fact, they cannot even work in the financial services industry unless they work as economists. So when you understand their prejudices, when you understand their love and their devotion to monetary policy and economic thought, economic theory, you understand why it is hard for them to take apart large banks. They recoil in horror at the notion that we are not going to have lots of big dealer banks in New York City. Well, folks, they are gone. They are gone. We cannot put Humpty-Dumpty back together again. So my sense is we have to excuse the people at the Fed from all direct responsibility for bank supervision. We give them a seat at the table by giving them responsibility for the things they do well, which is market liquidity risk management, market surveillance, et cetera. Do not ask them to do too many things. In my opinion--I worked on the Hill for Democrats and Republicans, and the thing you constantly do over and over again is give agencies too much to do. Let us give each one of these agencies ownership of the specific area: market liquidity risk for the Fed; supervision and even consumer protection in terms of the unified regulator; and then, finally, resolution and insurance for the FDIC separate from the supervisory activities. Why? Well, really, if I had my druthers--and I loved the comments from the community bankers before--I would like to see the FDIC evolve into a rating agency where we could look at the premium they charge banks not just for their deposits but for all of their liabilities, and use that rating, use that premium charge as a basis for the public to understand the risks that that bank takes. I am delighted to hear people talk about small banks. My company rates little banks. Most little banks are just fine. We have got 3,000-plus institutions in our rating system that are A or A-plus. The problem is we have got 2,000, as of the end of 2008, that we rate F. Half of those are victims of mark-to- market accounting; about a quarter of those banks have stopped lending entirely. You can tell because they are running off. They are shrinking. Their revenue is falling. They just are not in a position to lend. So I think what we have to do is ask ourselves a basic question: What do we want to achieve with the future regulatory framework? And who are going to be the owners of each piece? I have provided a little graphic here, and the one thing I would urge you to consider both with respect to consumer protection and all other areas is let us see if we cannot partner with the States. Why can't the Federal Government set consistent rules for all of the banking markets in the U.S.? Leave different types of charters in place, let us have diversity in terms of charts, but then we have to come up with a way of unifying capital requirements, unifying safety and soundness, and having a level playing field. I would love, by the way, to have better data on credit unions. I get calls about credit unions every day, but I cannot rate them because the data they put through the National Credit Union Administration is not organized properly. You guys have to go spend some time with the FDIC. Copy their methodology. I can get a bank call report off their Web site in real time now. It comes out at the same time as the EDGAR filing for public banks. That is what investors need. Finally, let me just make one other comment, and I look forward to your questions. The reason little banks are not in trouble as much as big banks is because the State and FDIC regulatory personnel did not let them get in trouble. They did not let them build a financial market that is based on notional, fanciful, speculative contracts that have no connection to the real economy. The biggest indictment of the Federal Reserve Board is that they have countenanced and encouraged renters to become equal with owners. That is what we have with AIG. The speculators, the dealers in New York, have leveraged the real world with these speculative ``gaming contracts.'' That is the only thing you can call them. If I want home insurance, do I go to the corner grocery store and pay him a premium every month? No. I go to a reputable insurance company. Everybody on the street knew that AIG was the dumbest guy in the room. They all knew, and they sucked that firm's blood for almost 7 years. Now we have to pay for it? No. I disagree. I will be happy to answer your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF RICHARD CHRISTOPHER WHALEN, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND MANAGING DIRECTOR, INSTITUTIONAL RISK ANALYTICS 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Ms. Hillebrand, thank you very much for coming.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, and Senators. I am Gail Hillebrand, Financial Services Campaign Manager for Consumers Union. You know us as the nonprofit publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, and we also work on consumer advocacy. I am happy to be here today to discuss how we are going to fix what is broken in our bank regulatory structure. Americans are feeling the pain of the failures in the financial markets. We are worried about whether our employers will get credit so that they can keep us in our jobs. Many households have lost home equity because someone else pumped up housing values by loaning money to people who could not afford to pay it back and made loans that no sensible lender would have made if they were lending their own money rather than putting the money out, taking the fee, and passing on the risk. We also have pain in households because of the abrupt increases in credit card interest rates. We have to start with consumer protection because the spark that caused our meltdown was a lack of consumer protection in mortgages. I am not going to talk generally about credit reform, but it will not be enough if we do stronger regulation and systemic risk regulation and we do not also do real credit reform. That would be like replacing all the pipes in your house and then letting poison water run through those pipes. We are going to have to deal with credit reform. We have two structural recommendations in consumer protection. The first one is for better Federal standards, and the second one is to acknowledge that the Federal Government cannot do it all and to let the States come back into consumer protection in enforcement and in the development of standards. We do not have one Federal banking agency whose sole job is protecting the financial services consumer, and we believe that the Financial Product Safety Commission will serve that role. It does not involve moving oversight of securities. That would stay where it is. But for credit, deposit accounts, and these new payment products, the Financial Product Safety Commission could set basic rules, and then the States could go further. Consumers know we have to pay for financial products, but we want to get rid of the tricks, the traps, and the ``gotcha's'' that make it very hard to evaluate the product and that make the price of the product change after we buy it. Our second structural recommendation in consumer protection is for Congress to recognize that the Feds cannot do it all and to bring States back into consumer protection in financial services regardless of the nature of the charter held by the financial institution. We have 50 State Attorneys General. That is a powerful army for enforcement of both State and Federal standards, and we have State legislatures who often will hear about a problem when it is developing in one corner of the country or one segment of consumers, before it is big enough to come to the attention of unelected bank regulators, and even before it is big enough to come to your attention. At the very time that States were beginning to try to address subprime lending by legislation in the early 2000s, the OCC was actively issuing interpretations in 2003, and then in 2004 a rule that said to national banks, ``You are exempt from whatever consumer protections States want to apply in the credit markets.'' We have to get rid of that form of Federal preemption; including the OCC preemption rule. Congress needs to clarify that the National Bank Act really just means ``do not discriminate against national banks,'' but not give them a free pass to do whatever they like in your State; and to eliminate the field preemption for thrifts in the Homeowners Loan Act. Those are going to have to go. We have already tried the system where Feds regulated Federal institutions and States regulated State institutions, and it did not work partly because these institutions are competing in the same market, and a State legislature cannot regulate just some of the players in the market. Turning to systemic risk, we do believe the most important step is to close all the regulatory gaps and to strengthen both the powers and the attitudes--the skepticism, if you will--of the direct prudential regulators. Every gap is a vulnerability for the whole system, as we have learned the hard way, and more attention needs to be paid to risk. We agree with many others who have said we need an orderly resolution process for nondepository institutions. There should be clear rules on who is going to get paid and who is not going to get paid. These institutions should pay an insurance premium in some way to pay for that program themselves. We do agree there will be a need for a systemic risk regulator. No matter who gets that job, it must involve a responsible and phased transition to get rid of ``too big to fail.'' Either regulation has to make these complex institutions too strong to fail, or if private capital does not want to put their money in these complex institutions, then we have to phase them into smaller institutions that do not threaten our system. In closing, we have got to get the taxpayer out of the systemic risk equation, and we have got to put consumer protection back into the center of bank regulation. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF GAIL HILLEBRAND, FINANCIAL SERVICES CAMPAIGN MANAGER, CONSUMERS UNION OF UNITED STATES, INC. 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. I appreciate again your testimony here this morning. It has been very helpful. Let me start the questioning. First of all, while I haven't cosponsored the bill that Senator Schumer and Senator Durbin have on financial product safety, I think there is some real value in the idea. I also think there is general consensus among our colleagues that we need to fix regulatory arbitrage, where banks shopping around for the regulator of least resistance. I am trying to sort of sense just in conversations where our commonality of interest is. I think there is general consensus in the community banks,",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I hear that all the time here--That people appreciate it when they speak to their own community banks. We should be more careful about how we characterize banking generally and look through what has been going on at the community level. Let me get to the issue of systemic risk. Mr. Whalen, your point about systemic risks is not a bad idea, that is, using the plural to talk about it, and also the issue of resolution management for nondepository institutions. I have some real reservations about the idea of the Federal Reserve. I just don't like the idea of a systemic risks regulator talking to itself. I think there is a danger when you are not listening to other voices when it comes to systemic risks, then you only hear your own voice. And as you are examining the issue of systemic risks, whether it is just by the size of the institution or the products and practices they are engaging in, there are various ideas that one ought to apply. Dan Tarullo, I thought, was very good the other day before this committee talking about how he would define systemic risk and the importance of looking at it from various perspectives. I, for one, would be intrigued with looking at alternative ideas, one of which has been raised by Gene Ludwig, who I think all of us are familiar with here. He raised the idea of a council, where it would be made up of the Fed, the OCC, the FDIC, possibly others, and where you would have a professional staff that would be analyzing systemic risk and rotating chairmanships with Treasury and others, so no one agency would necessarily dominate it. This is an idea that is interesting as an alternative to the Fed or some others that have been suggested. I would like, if you might, Mr. Whalen, to comment on this concept and if you think it has any value.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, I am kind of old fashioned. I start with the U.S. Constitution, and in the Constitution, it told the Congress you will have Federal Bankruptcy Courts, and in the 18th century, that basically meant that bankruptcy was remote from politics. Over the last two centuries, we have politicized insolvency. In the 1930s, we had the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, which is, if you think about it, an extra chapter of bankruptcy, special to deal with financial depositories. But at the end of the day, we have the mechanisms today to deal with these issues. We just don't have the political will. And you hear excuses coming from various quarters that say, oh, you can't resolve these big entities. They have complex financial relationships with other entities, dah, dah, dah, dah, dah. Well, if that is the case, then private property is gone. We have socialized our entire society and we might as well just dispense with it, nationalize the banks, and get on with ordering them in an efficient manner in a socialist sense. But that is not American. Americans are meant to be impractical because the Founders knew that inefficiency is a good thing. So how do we, on the one hand, keep our efficient market, keep markets disciplined, but don't destroy ourselves, and I think it comes back to limiting the activities and the behavior of the institutions. Don't think about systemic risk as a separate entity. It grows out of the activities of the institutions. And I will tell you honestly that our work, we did a lot of research on the profitability of banks, on the behavior of banks, their business model characteristics. The larger banks are not very profitable. I mean, they are almost utilities now. So what was the answer by the Fed? Let us take more risk. The Fed wants to keep their constituents profitable, healthy, liquid. They would push them up the risk curve in terms of trading activities, over-the-counter derivatives, what have you. But then you look at the little bank that has 80 percent assets and loans and they are more profitable. In fact, on a risk-adjusted basis, they are three times more profitable than a big bank. So what I am saying to you is that if you want to fix systemic, look at the particular.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","That is a very valid point. Mr. Patterson, how about you? I would like to hear from the other witnesses quickly on the systemic risks regulator, the idea of an alternative to the Fed.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","The concern, as I indicated in my prepared testimony, there has been a lot of focus on the Fed performing that function and there are pros and cons to it, but clearly they have been suggested. The major concern that I think my colleagues and I at the ABA would have is any interference with or encroachment on their primary duty, which is as an independent central bank responsible for monetary policy. That doesn't mean that they are not capable of performing that function, and I would respectfully say that I don't think the Fed has pursued a policy of encouraging riskier activities by larger institutions, but we do think their primary function is and should continue to be as an independent central bank primarily responsible for monetary policies.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","So an alternative idea to the Fed is something that you would be inclined, or willing to look at.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Yes, sir.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Attridge.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I don't have a problem with the----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","The microphone, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I am sorry. I guess I have to bring it back to where I am in terms of running a community bank, and speaking on behalf of our bank and other banks in Connecticut, most of those that have been damaged--and most are doing well.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I agree.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Their operating earnings are fine. Where they have been damaged is in the hits they have been taking to capital and those hits are coming from government-sponsored enterprises. A lot of them invested in Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac preferred stock over the years. They were encouraged to do so, and how could it be a bad investment? It was a government- sponsored enterprise. Fannie and Freddie, when you mention mortgages that are made by Fannie and Freddie, that is basically the gold seal. If you are buying Fannie and Freddie mortgages, they are appropriately underwritten and loan-to-values are good, people are rated to determine whether they can pay them back, and that is all fine. But someplace along the line, that failed, and for whatever reasons, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac went out and bought private securities that didn't fit their own standards for underwriting. The same thing has happened with the Federal Home Loan Bank, where banks are now concerned about the investment they have in the Federal Home Loan Bank, and most banks have basically said, well, we are not going to continue to borrow from the Federal Home Loan Bank until that gets resolved because we don't want to have any exposure. When is the other shoe going to drop with the Federal Home Loan Bank? They have cut their dividend. They said they are not going to buy back stock for those that are repaying off their loans and in the past would have had the right to offer their stock back. The Federal Home Loan Bank is not doing that for the same reason. They went out and bought so-called toxic securities. So whatever the regulator is has to look at not just the banks, they have to look at the kind of financial instruments that are basically everywhere and are being purchased by banks, others, insurance companies, et cetera. They are not being rated right by the rating agencies. I don't know whose job that is, whether it is the Fed or a council, as you mentioned, Senator. Someone has to look at all the instruments that are involved in our system. And someplace back in Economics 101, Wall Street was there to allow the average citizen to participate in the capitalistic society, a place where you could purchase stocks. I think a majority of Wall Street now, or a good part of it, is basically a casino, and the financial instruments are nothing more than gambling, in my opinion, and I am not sure that is----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","But the notion of the Federal Reserve, do you share the concerns expressed by Mr. Patterson and others about the Federal Reserve, given its responsibilities already in monetary policy and others----",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I don't share that concern. I just think they probably are sitting at--or of any institution we have now that is in the appropriate spot to look at the ramifications of what is going on from the highest part--from the top of the mountain, I think they are probably in that position.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Mr. Whalen, I want to pick up on something I understood you to be saying, and you can correct me if my impression is wrong. The Federal Reserve is and was the primary regulator of our holding companies, is that correct?",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Where were they, if they were a bank regulator, where were they as a bank regulator, their role there as all these big banks got in such awful trouble? Where were they? That is the question. And if they were the primary regulator, gosh, you would have to give them an ``F.'' You would have to give them an ``F'' if you were a teacher on their ability to regulate the banks. Now, as you mentioned, they are economists, basically, and so that is troubling to me and I think it is also to Senator Dodd, Senator Bunning, and others. A lot of people have been saying, gosh, we are going to have to give the Fed the power as we go down the road because maybe by default. I don't believe that. I think whatever we do here, we have got to do it right. We have got to be comprehensive about it. But gosh, I see the Fed as a bank regulator big-time failing the American people. Do you want to comment on that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, I think it is a failure born out of distraction. The Fed, as I mentioned before, the senior levels are populated by academic economists primarily. We occasionally let a banker in there or a generalist, but it has primarily become a place for patronage appointments of economists. And frankly, if you look at the history of financial economics, the development of innovation, as we call it, derivatives, et cetera, these are all the intellectual playthings of the economists. So they promoted all of this innovation that we have heard from the other witnesses that is, in fact, now killing the little banks who weren't involved in it in the first place.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Promoted the consolidation of the whole banking system, didn't it.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, yes, in a sense. I mean, if you look at Wells-Wachovia, the solution to a large bank insolvency was to slam it together with another large bank. This is a bad idea. We should resolve institutions as they are. You know, they were about to merge Citi with Wachovia. What do the people at the Fed think of? They have the data. They know what the profitability and the internal risk numbers are for these banks. So I think culturally, they are ill equipped to put to the sword the dealers who enable their monetary policy. If you want to really simplify it, they just can't bring themselves to be tough on the very institutions with which they depend on implementing monetary policy. You know, Bank of America and Merrill, I think is a classic example of this. Here was a horrible transaction that should never have been approved by the application side of the Fed, but the monetary policy people and the primary dealer folks said, oh, we have to keep this primary dealer intact. We have to sell Treasury bonds. Of course, it is a good point. I think we should have restructured the dealer and sold it to new investors. That is what we should have done. And the Fed can't do that. They are just completely incapable of making a decision like that, in my opinion.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","What is the end game with AIG, as you see it? More taxpayers' money floating their business and----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","No. I pray to God that we find the courage to put that company out of its misery and put it into bankruptcy, where it should have been 6 months ago, because if we don't do that, then we are holding the people of the United States and the world hostage to the credit default swap market. If you put AIG into bankruptcy, you are not going to end the world, but you are going to end the credit default swap market as we know it, and I think that would be a beneficial thing for everybody.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","There is no end game, is there.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, if we have the courage, there is----",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","No, but there is not right at the moment.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","No, not at the moment. No. Absolutely not.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Credit rating agencies--while many banks did not engage, as you said, in substandard underwriting for the loans they originated, many of these institutions bought and held so-called AAA-rated securities that were backed by the poorly underwritten mortgages. Mr. Patterson, I want to ask you this question. Why was it inappropriate for these institutions to originate these loans, but it was acceptable for them to hold the securities collateralized by them.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","If I understand the question, Senator Shelby, the ability to hold is based on the policies and the oversight of what the securities are backed by. If I could add to this just a little bit, one of the things that I think has exacerbated the problems we deal with enormously has been--and it is not unrelated to the question, I think--has been the fact that illiquid markets have resulted in an application by FASB and by the accounting fraternity in taking illiquid markets where there were no willing buyers and sellers and creating the necessity for an inappropriate write-down of the value of the assets which are otherwise still performing or at least are performing to a greater extent than the required write-down to a nonfunctioning marketplace. That is the subject of a broader discussion which I hope we have as to what a better solution would be with the role of the general primary regulator, the prudential regulator, and the systemic regulator as to ensuring that the current unresponsiveness, or at least the previous unresponsiveness of FASB and the SEC to find a reasonable solution to this problem that fits the business model of the institutions that are holding those investments is something that can and will be dealt with promptly.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Whalen, do you envision a powerful regulator of all of our financial institutions, in a sense, including insurance, because of the risk that some companies like AIG have caused in the marketplace.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, as I said in my remarks, I think the Congress needs to mandate a level playing field as far as disclosure goes, because that way, companies like mine can rate insurance companies, too. It is very difficult to do insurance companies right now because the industry sits on the data. The NAIC will not do what they need to do to get that data really usable like the FDIC. Let us remember, the FDIC is the gold standard when it comes to public disclosure of financial data. They have done tremendous things as far as making really useful portfolio- level data on banks available to analysts.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Whalen, where did the doctrine of ``too big to fail'' that our Fed Chairman is all wrapped around now come from and how flawed is that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Oh, it is hideously flawed. It goes against everything that Americans stand for. I think Andrew Jackson was right. The Fed, the central bank is a source of evil and we have to fence it. But having said all that, the bottom line is that since the LDC debt crisis and the real estate problems in the 1980s, the central bank has taken the view that certain large financial services companies cannot be subject to traditional bankruptcy, like WAMU, like Lehman Brothers. I would tell you that Lehman is the model. You should invite the U.S. Trustee for the Southern District of New York to come sit here all day and talk to you about the resolution of Lehman, because that is what we should do with AIG.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","If an institution is too big to manage, and a lot of them seem to be----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","----then it would follow that they are probably too big to regulate----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Oh, absolutely.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","----so we have created a monster among ourselves, have we not.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Our colleagues talked about the mountaintop, the God's eye view. There is no such thing, my friends. I work in analytics. I worked in finance my whole life. There is no God's eye view. And even when you give people information, they don't necessarily act on it. One of my best friends wrote a piece about AIG in 2001 that was covered in The Economist. Herb Greenberg threatened to sue him, and he didn't back down and eventually AIG had to go away. He was right, but nobody paid attention.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Johnson.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Mica, would you care to comment about Mr. Whalen's criticism of your industry and its ratings.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","I am not here to defend our regulator in that sense, but I will tell you this. We do have a call report and that call report does give data that we look at. It gives us a good picture of how a credit union is doing. Could it be better? Could the technology be better? Certainly. I don't know how he does his ratings, but let me just mention, the Chairman mentioned rating agencies earlier. I, 15 or 20 years ago, sat on the other side of this table and the largest insurance company failure in America happened and the day before, it was AAA ratings. So we are starting to see that all over again. We see it again, and it is not just one agency, it is others. So I do think that there are some areas that need to be looked at other than just the regulation of the industry, because you have to turn to others to get a sense of what you are investing in, and the public and the commercial enterprises of this Nation have looked there. So I don't have the answer. I just think it is something that needs to be looked at. And again, with regard to our regulator, our call report is good. It probably could be better.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Does CUNA support a systemic risk regulator? If not, please elaborate.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","We would support the concept of a systemic regulator. Again, we think that NCUA, because of the special nature of credit unions--credit unions are very unique in our financial services system--that they should continue, and we don't shop regulators. We have a dual-charter system, but we have lived and all federally insured credit unions all deal with the NCUA, but they have a special niche in our society. We are 6 percent of the market. And in every case we have seen historically--we were in the Farm Credit Administration, we are in the FDIC--wherever we get put, we get put down if we don't have some separate interest looking after us. So we do think the concept is worthy of discussion. The Chairman mentioned earlier about bringing together the three major entities that now regulate, and I don't know if that is the answer or not. I do tend to agree with one thing, not everything that Mr. Whalen said by any means, but the fact is that when it gets to the systemic risk level, the other agencies have already failed, the regulators, and if you are going to call on the ones who have already failed, you may have a problem with a little self-defensive feeling. But we are open to any concept because we don't ever want to see what is happening to this country happen again. We are willing to discuss it.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Attridge, in your testimony you suggest that depository institutions' withholding companies should have a systemic risk fee imposed on them by the FDIC. Can you expand on this idea? How much would this fee be in addition to regular premiums.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I don't know exactly how much the fee would be, but basically, right now, I disagree with the statement that the FDIC has failed in picking up systemic risk. I don't think that was their job. I am not sure their definition--they have done an excellent job in administering and regulating and resolving problems with the banks. I don't know what the details of their charter is, but I don't think that they were given the responsibility of regulating systemic risk.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","And I agree with that. I agree with that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","As far as our belief that some sort of premium should be paid, it basically just comes from the fact that right now, if you look at what is going on, a major problem for the community banks is the potential one-time assessment to refund the Insurance Fund, the FDIC Insurance Fund, and get the reserves back up to where they should be. Yet it is not really coming from problems that were in the community banks. It is coming from the systemic issues. At least that is my belief. So I don't know what the number would be. Certainly, whoever analyzes this could come up with a number that said, all right, in this holding company you have a bank. The bank would pay the FDIC insurance rates, but there is another part of that, of the risk in that holding company that will demand another premium that they would fund. And the amount of that, someone would have to really determine by analyzing the past history of the failures.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Patterson, currently, there are resolution mechanisms for depository institutions that fail, but not for holding companies of the depository institutions. Who should be in charge of unwinding failed holding companies.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I think, if I could respond and expand on that just a bit, I do think that the FDIC has the primary function in the insurance of deposits and the regulation of banks themselves. When we look at holding companies, we are looking at an evolving type of holding company, obviously, as a result of the crisis that we have gone through. We have a new cadre of holding companies that have entered that structure and have a period of time to come into compliance with it. They obviously are under the current law. But it does seem to me that this goes also to the issue of the nonbank financial companies that are, whether we agree that it should be or not, the reality is there is a ``too big to fail'' reality, at least in the present and soon-to-be-future instance. That to me calls for a solution that resolution, to your point, that is not the proper role for the FDIC, which ought to be focused on deposit insurance and the regulation of banks. I know that the Treasury has recently come with some ideas on this. I don't have a suggestion other than the fact that the resolution of those failures, particularly in the cases that I have described, should certainly be outside, in my opinion, be outside the realm of the FDIC's normal processes.",Speech, 
"Senator Johnson","My time is up. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Yes. A general question for everybody. Of you sitting at the table, how many believe that the Federal Reserve is an independent agency, since they have been involved with Treasury and others in making up all these bailout policies that we have been dealing with? And yesterday, according to the Secretary of the Treasury, they are responsible for the $1 trillion-plus that are going to buy up these supposedly illiquid assets. So if they aren't in bed with the administration and the Treasury, where are they as far as independence as their charter, the 1930-some, or whatever year it was written, charter for the Federal Reserve made them? Anybody.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Senator Bunning, it is very hard, not being in the room, to know who should have done what differently. We are concerned about two other encroaches on the----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","No, answer my question, ma'am.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","I think that they have opened the credit window in a way that has created some expectations it will remain open and we have to worry about closing that. We are also concerned----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Are they an independent agency? That is the question.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","So far.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","So far, they are an independent agency? Next.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","No.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","No.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I think they have abdicated all of their statutory responsibilities.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Responsibilities? Mr. Patterson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Clearly, it has become fuzzy of necessity. They have acted out of necessity, but----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Necessity? In other words, saving AIG was a necessity.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Was determined to be a necessity.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. Mr. Attridge.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I don't know the degree of their independence, as to how political they are, but I think I would say that if they are given the responsibility for overseeing financial risk, it would seem to me that they could bring on the kind of people that they need to do that job.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Are they or aren't they independent is the question.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Senator, I don't think I can answer that question.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. Dan.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Yes. Legally, they are. Actually, they are not as what they are doing----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK, that is----",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","May I clarify an earlier statement, though? It was----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","No. I have got limited time and you can't.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","I will come back later. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. Mr. Whalen, do you think there is anything that credit default swap add to the system that is worth the risk they pose.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Only if you restrict the purchase of protection to those who have an economic interest in the underlying basis, the company, the instrument. When you let derivatives settle in cash so that the buyer of protection doesn't have to deliver a bond or a loan or whatever else is used to define the terms of the contract, then you have loosed the bounds of earth and you allow people to multiply risk infinitely, and this is what we have with AIG.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","How many here at this table think that the new plan that the Secretary of the Treasury expressed yesterday in conjunction with the Fed--you know the reason they used the Fed is they don't want to come back to the Congress and ask for new TARP money because they know the answer will be, ``No.'' So they are going to have the Fed print the money and the American taxpayers be on the hook for the money, over $1 trillion again. Do you know how much money that is since last September? Seven trillion. That is more than our whole national debt was just, like, 5 years ago. Now, if you think that the Fed is an independent agency, you are smoking something that is illegal, because I have sat here in this same seat and asked Chairman Bernanke questions about ``too big to fail,'' and he said, yes, there are institutions too big to fail. And I asked him, who allowed that to happen, and he couldn't answer. And his only job at the time was to regulate mortgages and set monetary policy, failing in both.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I think the key failing of the Fed was their inability to say no, much like Moody's and S&P not saying no when the Street brought them toxic----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Yes, but they were getting paid huge sums of money for those AAA ratings and AA ratings, because I know, my son was involved with Moody's and Standard & Poor for his company, and when he got finished getting his BB rating, he had to pay $250,000 to those two entities.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","A very important point, if I can interrupt you. When Moody's and S&P were doing that, they were operating in the primary market for securities, before the securities are offered to the public. This is the key issue. When a rating agency is following a security in the secondary market, they are acting as journalists. But when they are in the conference room with the lawyers and the bankers structuring the liabilities of a brand new Delaware corporation that is going to issue securities to the public, they are acting as a banker. I was a supervisor of investment bankers, and this is why I get so enraged by this point. They were across the line. That is where we have a problem.",Speech,

"Senator Tester","",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. In these questions, I hope we can keep the answers fairly concise, but this first one is to Mr. Whalen. AIG, and all the banks that are too big to fail, if we allow them to fail, can you give me a short, very short synopsis on what the impacts are if AIG goes away.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","The bondholders will take a loss. We are subsidizing the bondholders and the counterparties of AIG right now with public funds. And we are doing this with Citi, we are doing this with Fannie and Freddie, and apparently we are prepared to do this with other banks so the taxpayer is going to subsidize the loss so that the bondholder does not take----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","What impact does it have on my operating loan as a farmer.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I think very little at the end of the day, if it is handled correctly.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","What impact does it have on the loan of the homeowner.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I think at the end of the day it would be beneficial. If an adult stands up and says I am going to resolve this, I am going to give you finality, I think the markets would rally.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Short term and long term.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","And what about if all 17 that are too big to fail--I think that is how many there are. Say there are 10.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Oh, I do not expect that to happen. Look, the top couple may need to be really restructured, but I am hopeful that if we turn the direction of the economy around we can deal with the others in a reasonable fashion.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","All right. And I do not want to put words in your mouth but--and I appreciate that perspective, by the way. You had said that you rate banks. There are 3,000 of them that are A; there are 2,000 of them that are F mainly due to mark-to-market.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","About half of the 2,000 at the bottom are mark- to-market, and the way we tell this is that they are not showing big loan losses. They have minus signs in their return on equity.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. How do we solve that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","You modify the FASB rule. But here is the thing, as I have been telling my clients: We may dodge the bullet by changing the accounting rules, but the underlying economics are still going to make us charge off these assets. So you are not getting anything. It is already baked into the pie. Whether we change the accounting rules or not, we are still going to see impairment on these assets as we go forward this year.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK. So in the end, end of story, those 2,000 are still in trouble.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","They are in trouble, but, you see, it is a very different thing when a bank is simply writing off assets that are still performing versus charging off loans that are lost. That is the difference.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","I understand. This is directed to Mr. Patterson or Mr. Attridge. I am hearing from my community bankers in the State of Montana--I do not think it is singular to them, because you guys addressed part of it--that the regulators are coming in, and even though the community banks for the most part, at least in my State, have done a great job, are coming in and putting the squeeze on them from a regulatory standpoint so they cannot loan money maybe because they are saying you either have to write down some of these loans or the mark-to-market issue comes up, or just the fact that they want to make sure that nobody fails or nobody gets in a situation where they have to shut them down, they are pinching them hard. And it is having some real negative effects in the economy because money is not available to be loaned for a whole different reason and all the other stuff. Could you kind of respond on that, Mr. Patterson or Mr. Attridge--Mr. Patterson first--if that is real and if you think it is necessary.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Certainly, there is at least some discussion that there may be a mixed message. But the fact is that the vast majority of banks are lending, do have lendable funds, do have strong capital ratios. And regulators in the field are always going to be focused on safety and soundness of the performance of the individual bank.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","But I am hearing from the banks right now they are more concerned about that than they were a year ago.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Well, I have been in this business 40 years at the same bank, and we have grown to be a rather large institution. And every time there is a down cycle in the industry, regulators focus a bit more on safety and soundness, and should. But I----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Mr. Attridge, do you--go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Could I just comment on something Mr. Whalen said? Just a slight disagreement on mark-to-market accounting and the impact on the books of the banks.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","His comment referred to an end loss, but I think the important thing is to understand that the role of FASB and the SEC, or whatever group, hopefully, succeeds in that responsibility to them, is such that the business model of the institution has an effect on the way that the new rules are promulgated. There is no reason for a bank whose business model is to buy and hold securities to have to take a loss that erodes their capital and inhibits their ability to make loans.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","I understand. Mr. Attridge, I want to go back to the regulation question. Does increased regulation for the community banks in particular by the OCC have negative impacts on those banks' ability to make loans? And is their increased regulation something you think is proper.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I have not experienced that. My particular bank--or my bank gets reviewed every 18 months, ultimately by the State of Connecticut as well as the FDIC. We are due for an exam at the end of April by the FDIC. I am hearing from other banks that have been reviewed more recently, and a mixed message: Some of them saying there is really no significant difference from their past exams; a couple have said, yes, they have been asked to basically rate- shock or adjust the values on some of their larger loans to----",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Do you hear it from any banks that are being regulated by the OCC.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Yes, and I would say it was probably more pronounced there in terms of the OCC's request that they look at the banks with a more--excuse me, look at the loans with a more jaundiced eye, look at real estate values, and look at how those loans would perform if there was deterioration, further deterioration in the economy.",Speech, 
"Senator Tester","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Tester, very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Mr. Chairman, thank you. Let me start out, if I might, and actually thank the Chairman for his comments about the Federal Reserve as the super-regulator, if you will. I have not liked that idea from the beginning. It would seem to me to be just an enormous conflict of interest, that you would have the policymaker, the monetary policymaker then regulating the very entities that implement the policy. And I think that would just be all tied around the axle very, very quickly, and as you point out, they are finding it hard to regulate. So I am glad that idea has surfaced and been discussed, but I am hoping at some point here we put that to bed quickly because I think it is just the wrong direction, and I want to say that to start out. If I could, Mr. Whalen, a couple of questions for you. When you talk about systemic risk and the need to focus on that, do you include in the definition of that risk just the sheer fact that an institution, if you were to look at their books, may look good, may even look great, but they have just gotten so darn big that if anything happens, the threat of bringing the Nation's economy down is real and exists? Is that something we should be looking at, just the bigness, the magnitude of the organization? I would like to hear your thoughts on that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I think there are two aspects to that. It is a very good question. One is size and the other is complexity. If you look at Citi, for example, a quarter of their liabilities actually contribute to the deposit insurance fund now, the domestic deposits. The foreign deposits do not contribute and all of the bonds, which fund the other half of the company, do not contribute. So if you look at Citi, really they are actually contributing on a dollar of assets basis less than the community bankers are, because most of their deposits are domestic. The little guys are pulling the train. So I think that Congress has to look at market share and has to look at complexity, and based on those two, if it were up to me, I would break up the top four banks and have them end up maybe a third of their current size. If I had 10 or 20 or 30 banks the size of U.S. Bankcorp, instead of four, which now predominate over the entire industry, I think we would have a more stable system. Let me give you a number that will probably scare you a little bit. My maximum probable loss for the banks in the country above $10 billion in assets is $1.7 trillion. That is what we call ``economic capital.'' It is a worst-case loss number. But $1.4 trillion of that is top four institutions. There are a lot of banks in that list that actually subtract from that number because they are so much less risky than the big guys. We need a market share limit that looks at liabilities instead of deposits, in my opinion, and then as I said before, I would love to see the FDIC, as part of the systemic risk solution, rate banks based on their risk. Their premium, the contribution, the tax that they pay toward bank resolution costs should reflect their riskiness. And many of the institutions at this table would obviously be at the low end of that scale, as they should be.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Your thoughts on this tend to lend some support, in my judgment, to this concept of maybe it is almost a group sort of approach, because you are looking at a number of different factors, and I wanted to throw that out. The second thing that I wanted to ask you--and this is maybe a little bit at the edges, but maybe not. When I think about systemic risk and I think about what has happened in the last 6 months, I think about the money that has been put into AIG and others, and I recognize it is all borrowed money. And I ask Chairman Bernanke about this, and he thoughtfully answered that, you know, this is a very difficult time for the economy, we probably need to solve the deficit issue at a later date. Next week, we will start debating a budget with massive deficits, as far as the eye can see, new programs, Government expansion, on and on and on. How big of a risk is that to our economy? I see China's comments. I see economists starting to opine about the threat that this is creating. How big of a risk is our inability to manage our deficits to our Nation's economy.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, I think it is a horrible risk, and what I have said to people in the administration and to my clients and the readers of our public newsletters is that I do not think we can fund it. Does anybody really believe that we can go to market looking for $200 or $250 billion at a shot in new money and roll the existing paper that is coming due in that period? I do not think we can fund it. We have to go look for ways to limit the cash cost of subsidies for our financial institutions so that we can focus on the economy. And the way you do that is by resolving these companies in the traditional fashion. Otherwise, these zombies will keep eating cash as long as we leave them alive. That is the issue. If you want to stop giving money to AIG, push it into bankruptcy. Let the State of New York Insurance Commissioner deal with the underwriters, and then the rest of it gets resolved by the U.S. Trustee. And I will say it again: That man should be sitting here. I would spend a whole week with him.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Mr. Chairman, thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to continue a little bit on the line of my colleague from Nebraska on the ``too big to fail'' component. Mr. Whalen, I thought some of your comments were very telling in terms of the amount of exposure we have from the top four banks. I guess I would ask Mr. Patterson, perhaps wearing more of your ABA hat than just your Bancorp hat, whether, one, you agree with Mr. Whalen's comments; and, two, some argument meant that if we were to try to look at size and complexity and draw the line, how that would position our industry with our foreign competitors that may or may not take similar actions.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Senator, I think that is an excellent point to raise about the fact that we are not isolated from foreign competitors and we are in a global economy. The fact is, whether we like it or not, we have arrived at a situation where too big to fail is a reality, whether it is a desirable circumstance or not or whether there is an available short-term solution to that or not. Be that as it may, that is where we are. And I think what it does is it speaks eloquently to the need for a systemic regulator, whether it be the Fed or whether it be a committee approach or a new entity that the Fed has some involvement with or not. The problem here is not bank regulation. The problem is gaps in regulation, and excessive leverage by institutions, both banks and others in that large category, and lack of understanding of the types of risks that were being taken by management and by regulators. But I do think this: I think that we have got to realize that it takes large, complex organizations to operate in a global economy, and I think there is a role for the community banks, there is a role for the regional banks like mine, and I think there is a role for these very large, complex money center organizations that perform multiple functions. Indeed, they are hard to manage. Some people say they cannot be well managed. Some people say the Fed should focus on its management of monetary policy and its independence and not be the prudential regulator of overall responsibility. Whether it is or should not does not obviate the need for it, that there be some control that these gaps be filled. And I would suggest at least the hypothesis that if these institutions were broken up, others would evolve to develop to fill their place over time.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Mr. Chairman, I have got a couple more questions. Can I go ahead and----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Absolutely. Please do.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I guess one thing we have had under the Chairman's leadership, we have had a lot of folk come by on this issue of too big to fail, and we have one camp who has kind of said too big to fail, although oftentimes we have not had anyone take us through what that failure would actually look like, and other than this kind of cataclysmic event that would somehow unwind and have enormous negative ramifications. And then, on the other hand, we have regulators who come here and say it is not that they are too big to fail, but we just do not have a resolution authority for bank holding companies. So one thing, Mr. Chairman, I would love to have, whether in this session or elsewhere, is at some point perhaps almost some tutorial on what would an unwinding of one of these top four institutions look like.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I could give you one right now.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","If you could do that quickly, because I want to come back around to the products question as well.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, very simply, if it were up to me, with Citi I would roll the entire organization into a national bank. I would get rid of the holding company, and I would convert all the debt into equity, because then you would have a bank with 50-percent tangible common equity, and you could put Government money in and work through the bad assets, and they would no longer be an issue. We would not hear about them anymore. That is how you deal with this with finality, because they have a choice. You go to Citi and say, look, form a creditors committee, I want to talk to you in a week; otherwise, I let Sheila resolve the holding companies--the banks, and the holding company goes into bankruptcy. It is a very short conversation.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I wish it was that simple. Perhaps it is, but I would love to hear that thorough debate because I think many of us up here, we hear the frustration with ``too big to fail'' comments, yet at times other than perhaps the comparison is always made to the disorderly dissolution of Lehman and what happened in that case and how we do not want prevent that again, but----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Nobody does not want to get paid. But Lehman Brothers to me is a classic example of why the good people in the U.S. Federal Bankruptcy Court should be the first folks you talk to about this. You do not need another layer of politics to deal with holding companies, because once the bank is gone, what do you have? You have a Delaware corporation that belongs in front of the U.S. Bankruptcy Court. The moment the FDIC becomes receiver of the banks, it is no longer a regulated entity. They are gone. The deposits are gone. The loans are gone. That is the point.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Let me come at this from a different way, and I am going to thank the Chairman for giving me a little more time. We look at size, we look at complexity. Another approach which I have been thinking about for some time is on the financial products end. Again, my premise is--and I would like to hear from a number of you, if you want to comment. And I spent 20 years around financing more in the venture capital end, but, you know, under the guise of innovation, it appears to me that over the last 10 years we have created a whole series of financial products that at some level have been argued that they have been about better pricing risk. I think on reflection it may be the marginal societal value of better pricing risk versus the type of systemic exposure that it has created and that many of these financial products may have been more about short-term fee generation than they have been about long-term value to the system. But if we were to--and I know Senator Schumer has mentioned an approach he has taken, and I would love to see what would be the--what kind of thinking any of you have done in terms of the criteria of how we might on a going-forward basis evaluate financial products. Is there an underlying theory? Is it just the risk they bring to the system? Would there be some effort to try to make an evaluation of a macrolevel societal value added for these new financial products? How do you do that, and how do you--you know, I am a little bit afraid that we closed the door on certain products from the last crisis, but with the amount of intellectual fire power going into financial engineering, how are we going to preclude the next generation of financial products kind of getting beyond our control or oversight? Ms. Hillebrand, or anyone else on that comment.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Thank you, Senator Warner. I think there are two things. One is the Financial Product Safety Commission would be charged not with minimizing all risk but with minimizing undue risk to consumers, including keeping up with those new practices and those new products, so that the consumer who overdraws by 85 cents does not face $126 in bank fees, as happened to a consumer who we talked to earlier this month, and keeping up, looking at the practices. This is not to say banks cannot charge fees, cannot do anything, but to try to watch the practices and to outlaw those products that just do not fit with the nature of the product. Your checking account should be a service you pay for and not a fee machine for the bank. We need to get back to that kind of common sense. We think a Financial Product Safety Commission could do it on the consumer financial product side. In the mortgage and credit area, we also need to create accountability structures so that everybody who has a piece of that loan has responsibility going forward. That means a suitability requirement for those who are selling, a fiduciary requirement for those who are advising, and as people talk about ``skin in the game,'' a responsibility going forward if there are later problems with that loan. That is a beginning.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Well, my time has expired. I know Senator Menendez--but I would like to hear from others, perhaps, if you could get back to us on what would be that--I still did not hear what would be the underlying theory of how we would evaluate financial products on a going-forward basis. We do not want to stem innovation and, clearly, some level of responsibility and higher minimum investment requires qualified investor criteria and other things I get. But what would be the underlying theory of how we should regulate or evaluate financial products. Thank you for allowing me a little additional time, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, it is a great question, Senator Warner, and we will come back to it because I think it is an important point. One of the arguments I have made on this is you have got to begin with an overriding principle and concept. Just very briefly I would just say what happened over the years is, because some either promoted this idea very aggressively or acquiesced to it, is that we believed that consumer protection was antithetical to economic growth. If you were involved in consumer protection, this was somehow going to stifle creativity and imagination in wealth creation. And I think that was the fundamental flaw. When you begin any of this discussion, it is important to point out that the reason my community banks in Connecticut and Montana and elsewhere have done well over the years is because they deal with customers every day. When you are dealing with investment banks and others, they just do not have that portal. When you have got to have a customer making a choice whether or not to go to your bank in Connecticut, the Connecticut River Bank, or to Liberty or to some other community bank, local bankers, as yours do in New Jersey and Virginia, better keep that consumer in mind. And if you do not, you are going to be in trouble. And when you abandon that notion, what happens to that depositor, what happens to that person who buys a share, what happens to that person who buys an insurance policy, what happens to that person who takes their hard-earned money and deposits it in a bank, there are different expectations about what they can have. But, nonetheless, you begin with the notion of that investor, that depositor, that consumer, that shareholder, and you have a whole different perspective on this issue. I am sorry. I did not mean to digress, but to me, if you begin from that point, it seems to me then you can begin to start making sense of all this. Do you want to comment on that, Mr. Patterson?",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Yes, Mr. Chairman, if I may. I think your points go directly to the issue and the truth of the matter as you related to your Connecticut colleagues and I to my banks throughout the mid-South, is that our prudential regulator looks at the entire organization and ought to have a key role, and I think does have a key role, in the basic commercial bank system to not only ensure safety and soundness and compliance with other regulations, but also consumer protection. And that is why the problems generally that we are talking about today came from the nonregulated sector where those gaps are.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. As Mr. Attridge knows we have a lot of competition in Connecticut when it comes to community banking.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Right. Banking is a risk business, and in dealing with our customers, we can assess the risk. We get their financial information and make a decision whether they are a good loan or not. The problem is there are a lot of other investments that we have to make. All banks have an investment portfolio that is partly for liquidity, partly for investment purposes. And we are relying or have been relying in the past that a rating agency and others, brokerage firms, have assessed the quality of the investments we are buying. And that has kind of broken down, to the point where we are asking people, you know, are you sure that there is nothing in this package of, you know, mortgage-backed securities that we are buying--even though they are Fannie Mae/Freddie Mac rated, are you sure that there are no nonqualifying assets. And that is where the system is broken. I think that is what a systemic regulator has to oversee.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I can just tell you that up here around this table, having been now through eight hearings and a lot of individual conversations with my colleagues on both sides, I mentioned earlier certain things, regulatory arbitrage being one. I can also promise you rating agencies are going to be very much a part of our overall effort. There is commonality at certain points here and there will be points where we will have some debate about which way to go. But on rating agencies, I will bet there will be an answer, other than what we presently are dealing with.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Could I make a quick point.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Menendez, I apologize.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Just to answer Senator Warner's question, it comes down to suitability when you are talking about complex institutional products that could hurt a bank or hurt a pension fund or a public agency that has to invest on behalf--these are nonprofessionals, oftentimes, as I describe them. These people cannot model the risks in these securities, so they should not be shown them in the first place. And I say this as a reformed investment banker. Ninety-nine percent of the people in this world cannot possibly understand complex structured assets or over-the-counter derivatives. They are not suitable. They should not be sold to these people in any case.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But haven't we proven the case that even in some cases the uppermost levels----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","----at these very financial institutions--",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Absolutely.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","----that are supposed to be the most sophisticated borrowers did not even understand these products.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","That is right.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","And the risk exposure they were taking on.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","So why does the Fed, and particularly the Fed, go out of its way to promote and extend the over-the-counter market? It boggles my mind.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, this is where the clearinghouse notion comes in. So you get these exotic instruments; you just cannot have them being pushed out the door without----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Well, clearing only gets you so far, though, because, remember, the issue is a central counterparty who is holding the money. It is like playing poker. If you were playing poker with somebody who did not have to put chips on the table, you would not be very happy with that, would you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You are maligning gamblers.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I agree. The Nevada Gaming Commission would----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Gamblers lay off debts.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Absolutely. If the New York Lottery----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","A good bookie will lay off a debt. This was not even good gambling.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","The Nevada Gaming Commission could do a better job.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","A good bookie will lay off a debt. They do not assume all that risk.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","AIG did not do any downside hedging.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. This was worse than that, my sense. Anyway, Senator Menendez, I apologize for that digression.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Coming from New Jersey, I know what a good bookie does.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","But in terms of the legitimate industry that exists in Atlantic City, so I just want to make that clear. You know, I have been listening to a lot of what we have been doing here, Mr. Chairman, for several hearings now, and it seems to me one of the primary questions--and I would like to ask Mr. Patterson, since you are here on behalf of the American Bankers Association. Isn't it--when an entity is too big to fail, haven't we failed already.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Certainly, if an entity cannot be properly regulated, then that is obviously a positive response to your question.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, it seems to me that when we get to, whether it be in AIG or certain banking institutions that have been defined, that they create systemic risks to our overall economy because they are too big to fail, that we have already failed when they have become too big to fail because, in essence, we are saying that the risk comes to us as a society because should they make bad mistakes--and I agree that certainly if we had the regulators being the cop on the beat instead of asleep at the switch, that we may not have been totally headed to the directions we are, even though in many respects the regulators not only were asleep at the switch, but you had a whole universe of new financial instruments that they were not even engaged in. But at the end of the day, it just seems to me that the consolidation took place in such a way that entities became so big that they are too big to fail, and therefore the risk goes to the society should they fail. And in doing so, that is a pretty significant shift. And the question is, should you allow entities, whether they be an insurance company or a financial institution, to grow to the point that they are too big to fail.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Well, I think philosophically we would all agree that that is a bad proposition.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","We see how bad a proposition it is right now.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","That is correct. And in my opening oral comments, I made the comment that we all agree that ``too big to fail'' is an issue and it is a problem and it shouldn't exist. We also agree that in the present instance, it does, so we have a twofold task here, and that is to deal with it. Our suggestion is that we have a prudential regulator that has overall systemic risk responsibility.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","But up until now, to be honest, wasn't the drive to basically say, leave the marketplace to act on its own, and if consolidation took place, so be it, under the presumption that the regulators were going to keep it in check.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I think that is a reasonable presumption and it obviously has----",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Has not worked.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","----the issues that it has created.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Ms. Hillebrand, if you want to comment on this. I also want to ask you, much of our discussion of regulatory reform has talked about systemic risk. It has talked about complicated financial instruments that pose a threat to institutions and investors. But isn't it equally important to recognize that maybe the earliest and most fundamental failure that led to our current crisis in which--and it was a much simpler failure--is a lack of consumer protection.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Yes, Senator, absolutely. These bad mortgages--the bad practices in subprime were not new. They used to be called hard money loans. The theory was you could make money by loaning to someone who you had no reasonable expectation they would be able to repay. When that migrated into securitization, then it started to touch the whole economy, and we certainly saw it in nonprime with the no-doc loans. This little failure that first affected poor people and working class people and their neighborhoods suddenly kind of took off because it wasn't stamped out early. We don't know what the next little failure that could grow into a forest fire will be, but we know there will be one. Some innovation is toxic and early is the time when we need to address it. On the issue of have we already failed if an entity is too big to fail, I think the answer is yes and the question is what do we do from here. Part of it is we have to figure out how to make these entities whose complexity creates a risk for those of us who don't own them and are not their bond holders, but just taxpayers, to carry that risk themselves, to put that into their cost structure. If it is too expensive to internalize those risks, then that means that we need smaller institutions. And I am very intrigued by the ICBA suggestion that no further mergers be approved that involve institutions--involve or would create institutions--that are too big to fail.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","To some degree, in this present market that we are in, where we see one of the first things that happened in the first tranche of TARP was, in fact, the purchase of other institutions, and therefore more consolidation in the marketplace. Isn't that something that we should be concerned about as we look forward in terms of these set of circumstances.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","With healthy institutions, no. As it was, I think, alluded to before, the industry can't shoulder the burden of the losses that are coming toward us. The Treasury is going to have to be involved. So if you go to a strong institution that is well managed and you say, we are going to give you more capital. We want you to eat everything that Sheila is cooking coming out of the resolution process with the FDIC. I think that makes sense, but I wouldn't allow any further combinations for the top 15, 20 banks. Why? Until we know how they are. Call me in 18 months and then maybe we will revisit this issue. But I don't want to see any more large bank mergers until we know what their loss rates are going to look like and we know what their capital needs are. I think that is a reasonable position on large banks. Small banks, it is case by case because you have a lot of strong entities. You want them to buy troubled institutions to help the public. You want there to be continuity. I mean, the FDIC does this every Friday and they are expanding their capacity so they can do more resolutions. It is a beautiful thing. When they close a bank on a Friday, there is a new owner over the weekend and on Monday morning they open and the public is served.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","That, I understand. I was talking about large institutions purchasing other----",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Oh, I wouldn't allow it. In fact, you know, there is a moratorium now on de novos. They are not approving de novos applications now. They are basically telling all investors, focus on the troubled banks.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","One final question. With reference to the credit rating agencies, Mr. Attridge, you referenced them. Do you all have views as to how we, since you deal with them all the time and rely upon them to a great deal in terms of going ahead and making your loans, you know, do you have views on eliminating conflicts of interest that many of us consider pervade the credit rating industry, or have you anything that you think the SEC has done or should do.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Well, all banks are asked to risk assess virtually everything they do, every kind of an investment they make. But the reality is, community banks, and even larger banks, do not have the wherewithal to risk assess every single investment, especially any kind of package of mortgages that have been packaged either by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, et cetera. Someone has to do that. I think what we are missing is the oversight of whoever it is that is putting those packages together, and that would include the brokerage firms that are packaging them as well as the rating agencies. And clearly, AAA doesn't necessarily mean AAA anymore and that is a major problem for banks that are trying to make reasonable decisions when you have brokers calling you to say, you have got to buy this instrument. It is a great piece. We have been very fortunate in getting good advice from our brokers and we have avoided all of these, mainly just out of sheer maybe just sheer fear. We are saying, you know what? We are just not going to take a chance unless we are absolutely sure that it is Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac quality investments, and that is what we have invested in. We stayed away from auction rate preferreds and things of that nature that I think very few people understand. But it is because we just don't have the confidence at this point in the institutions that are putting ratings on those investments.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Menendez.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, and I thank all the witnesses. First, to Mr. Mica, I want to come back to the legislation that I proposed to remove the business cap. Are your membership hearing from small businesses on an accelerated basis.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Absolutely, and it is being reported throughout the country, and you have heard it here today. Banks and institutions are not lending the way they used to. They have withdrawn. Just the other day, the President made a comment that 70 percent of all jobs in America come from small businesses. We have a cap of 12.5 percent. We do the job well. Our portfolio, by the way, is less than 1 percent default. And I know I get some criticism from some of our opponents who say, well, they don't know how to do it. They made a bad loan in Texas. Tell me about making a bad loan.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","I mean, we have----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","So you think there would be significant desire----",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","We could put $10 billion on Main Street, $10 billion into Main Street small loans almost immediately if they lifted that cap.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Mr. Attridge, let me just ask you, why at this time--we can debate whether this should be done permanently--but why at this time when so many banks, big and small, are not lending for a variety of reasons, and I hear about it regularly--I have several instances in my State where a small business is going to go under because they can't get bank lending. The existing bank has pulled the line of credit. They don't think the value of the inventory is as great as it used to be. Credit unions want to lend and they can't because they are at the cap. Give me a reason why we shouldn't, at the very least, temporarily lift the cap, given the state of our economy.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Well, first of all, Senator, I haven't experienced that. I keep hearing----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Assume it is true.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Most----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Give me an argument against doing it, but just assume it is true, because I am telling you, I have come up against those instances.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Of removing what cap now, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Removing the 12.5 percent limit on credit unions lending to small businesses. I mean, I understand it gives your membership more competition, but I am talking about now where we are desperately short of credit in the economy and lending to small businesses.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Well, Senator, I guess from the community banks' point of view, at least the community banks in Connecticut and I know there are some in other parts of the country that are more stressed out because of the real estate issues in the area they are in, but we are well capitalized. We have the money to lend. We are lending and we are looking for loans and there is competition out there for good loans. The problem is on the other side. The small businesses are not looking for----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Let me tell you a story I heard, and this is a Connecticut story. It is about a gentleman who applied for a job with me, OK. His father owns a small home heating oil delivery business. It has, I don't know, about 50 employees, ten trucks, I don't know how many. It had a $4 million line of credit with one of the larger banks, not a community bank, probably one of--I am certain it is one of Mr. Patterson's members. They pulled the line of credit. He has gone everywhere under the sun to try to find a substitute line of credit. This business is profitable. People are still buying home heating oil in Southwestern Connecticut. He can't find it. So you tell me your people are lending. Mr. Patterson tells me his people are lending. Every one of us at the table has had businesses calling us and saying they can't find the lending.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Well, Senator, we haven't----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","And I know----",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","We haven't changed our underwriting criteria. What has changed is the economic environment we are lending in.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","So if a credit union would want to lend to this small business and the local community banker for whatever reason wouldn't, why not let them? Mr. Whalen.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","You want to first make sure that that credit union understands what they are getting into and that they have the ability to create and manage small business credits----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","----because the reason for the cap was to protect them.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Well, some would say that is the reason for the cap. Mr. Mica is saying the other way. He is saying the reason is to protect the people who didn't want the cap. Ms. Hillebrand is acknowledging. I think the history shows this was pushed not by the regulators, but by the bankers, and I have-- community banks do a great job in New York. I have a very good relationship with them.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Just make sure they have the capability to----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Well, that is a different issue, but most of them--I mean, the record of the 12.5 percent is good, so they know how to do it. Yes, Mr. Patterson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Yes, Senator Schumer. You asked for facts. I am reasonably certain that most of the credit unions are well within the cap that exists today already, so I am not sure to what degree that is a limitation. I know they would like to have the cap raised, but I am quite sure that almost all of them are well within it.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Is that true, Mr. Mica.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Some are below, but many are pushing it. But worse, we have credit union after credit unions that come to me and say, I can get in this business and do this today, but I am not going to get in when there is only a 12.5 percent cap. So we are restricting loans, too.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I had a follow-up.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","You made a reference to the fact that in the example you used, the line of credit was pulled by one of the large metropolitan banks.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Those institutions obviously in the present environment are capital constrained by the assets that are on their books, the difficult things that they are having to deal with----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Yes, I know that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","----as a result of all this. So they clearly are capital constrained. The vast majority of commercial banks are looking for loans, have the equity to support continuing to expand loans. And I think if you would survey throughout the membership of the ABA, the availability of credit is not an issue, except possibly in metropolitan areas such as where the money center banks had their----",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","Well, let me tell you, I have found in New York, and I compared this to my colleagues--my time is up--that that is not the case, that we not only have a failure for people to get new lending, but you have lines of credit being pulled regularly from institutions that are still profitable, and it is because of what you said. They have an asset on their books that is valued at 80. It was once 100. It is at 80, but they are worried it might go to 50. They are not making a new loan. They are holding their capital in case it falls to 50. I am not right now criticizing the bank that does that. They are looking for their own survival. I am just saying we have to find new ways of lending. One quick last question just to Mr. Patterson. Do you think the TALF will expand more lending, particularly to small business.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Based on what I know about it, which is somewhat limited, it seems that it does have that capacity.",Speech, 
"Senator Schumer","OK.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. Interesting questions. Let me ask, and I realize this is new and so I don't expect you to have a detailed answer, but I wonder if I might just get a reaction to the proposal made yesterday by the Secretary of the Treasury and the White House on the public-private partnership idea. I realize I am--just a general reaction. I don't expect you to have necessarily detailed information about it. Congressman Mica, do you have a reaction.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Well, our reaction is we hope it works.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","But we all do that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","You know, the details are very slim for us. We are taking a look at it right now. I do think the concept of getting the private sector involved in this is very creative and helpful, because obviously it hasn't worked the other way. Beyond that, I think I had better withhold.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Attridge, any reaction to this, as someone who watches this stuff.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I still don't know what happens to the underlying value. I mean, there are losses there and they are going to have to be recognized someplace. You can buy all the toxic assets back, but you are buying from someone who is going to have to write them off.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, you just hit the right question, because I think everyone--they have asked the question, will buyers buy. I think buyers are going to buy. The question is, will the sellers sell.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","They will buy it at a price. That is right.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","The question is whether or not sellers sell. And so the issue is whether or not the banks are going to want to have an adverse effect on their balance sheets by selling or being forced to sell something for far less than they think it is worth.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","A perfect example, I think, is the Federal Home Loan Bank right now. One of them wrote off about $329 million----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","----marking it to market. Their claim is that if they hold it to maturity, they will probably only have to write off $40 million. So if you go to them now and say, we are going to pay you market value and basically reaffirm the fact that they should have written off the 399, because that is what it is worth today, I don't think they are going to do it because they are going to take that hit to capital.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Just chatting with you here, I see the other side of the coin is that obviously we are all better off if these assets are off the balance sheets and markets can start functioning again. So there is that potential value, as well. And I understand your point clearly, because it does have an adverse effect on the balance sheet. But the upside is credit begins to flow again, to some extent. Do you want to comment on this, Mr. Patterson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Yes, please. It underscores the importance of an effective mark-to-market accounting. If we have got a willing buyer, a willing seller, we are going to establish a bid-ask price, the transactions can be effective and they can achieve the intended results. What we don't need to have is an extension of the FASB approach that winds up with unintended write-downs for everyone with similar types of assets. If these institutions, even though they have absorbed the write-down, have the capital to support maintaining them on their books, then they are going to have an incentive to keep them.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Do you have any comment, Mr. Whalen.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","Just two points. I think the key flaw in the Fed-Treasury approach is that they still want to recreate the old securitization market. They want to breathe life into securities that are dead. These are busted deals. No buy-side investor, other than the vulture community, is ever going to care about these deals again, regardless of what they were rated initially. They are gone. So the audience is small for this proposal. The other thing I worry about is that I still don't think investors are going to care, because people in my industry know that whereas we are getting relief on the accounting side, as I said before, the cash-flows are still falling. So it is very likely that we are going to see economic impairment to these assets as opposed to accounting rule-driven markdowns that we have seen before. And so my question is that if you are assuming that these assets are worth 80 cents, which I think is the core assumption by Fed and Treasury, and that all we need is time to help the markets recover back up to that intrinsic economic value of the security, I think that is a false assumption. I think we should be liquidating these instruments. In other words, Treasury should buy them. I would like them to give them to the FDIC, make them an asset of the Deposit Insurance Fund, and then I would like to see FDIC walk into court in Delaware, after they talk to the trustee, of course, and say, Your Honor, we are liquidating the trust on behalf of the holders. We are going to give them notice, the ones who haven't responded yet, and then we are going to extinguish the trust and get the loans, sell them to the community bankers, let them deal with it, because they are the only ones with the people to deal with this problem. The money centers with a call center in Colorado somewhere cannot restructure loans. You have got to get the customer in front of the banker.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Patterson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I think we need to be very cautious about considering the role of the FDIC as an intermediary in that process. The Deposit Insurance Fund is funded by the commercial banks. We need to maintain the integrity of that system. The FDIC, obviously in collaboration with the leadership in Congress, is looking at ways to work with their working capital, but whether it has to do with the resolution of a nonbank major systemically important institution and the cost of that resolution or whether it has to do with such an intermediary role, the Deposit Insurance Fund does not need to be a part of that process.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I disagree, Mr. Chairman, and let me just jump in here. It is all run off the Treasury. Whether we are talking about the FDIC Fund or any other Federal agency other than Pension Benefit Guaranty, it is all running out of the Treasury's general fund. So let us just dispense with this distinction.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Mr. Chairman, there is one other issue on the new program----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I will come right to you. Go ahead. I just want to finish this.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I have to respond to that. The Deposit Insurance Fund has always been completely funded by the commercial banks. It is and it needs to continue to be. It is not a Treasury function.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","It is part of the general fund.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Mr. Chairman, there is one other issue that will need to be looked at in how this is done, and it will be in the details that come out after today. If these assets are bought and held until they are paid off, it won't be an issue. But if they are bought by people who intend to liquidate them promptly, there will be some significant questions about responsibilities in debt collection, so that we don't get the kinds of problems that we already have when very old debts are bought by someone who hasn't got the paperwork, can't prove what was owed, and doesn't have the records. That puts the consumer in an impossible situation.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","OK.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mica","If I may, I know we are the small ones at the table, but the way this legislation and previous legislation has been written, all the remnants of these big problems are being left certainly on the big institutions, but we end up with some of those, too, and we should not be discriminated against and left out. If there are going to be opportunities to offload some of these difficult problems that were created by others, we should be included in that. So I appreciate your consideration as you move forward on that and you look at that legislation, but to date, wherever there has been an indication to help us, the regulations have essentially ended up saying, we haven't taken you into consideration, possibly because you are too small, or possibly because we think you are doing so well. But we shouldn't be left with the remnants of everybody else's problem and no exit, either.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Let me come back, if I can, to this consumer protection notion. Let me start with you, Mr. Attridge, as a community banker. Sometimes the consumer protection notions have been secondary thoughts, at least that is my impression. I am speaking very generically now. And the issue of safety and soundness trumps every other consideration, including consumer protection. At least that is the impression I have had. What is your reaction to a Financial Product Safety Commission idea that has been articulated by the Consumer Union and others? Elizabeth Warren at the Harvard Law School has been, I think, probably the leading advocate of the idea. But how do you react to that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","Well, my experience has been, and I believe the experience of most of the community banks in Connecticut is the compliance section of the FDIC and the CRA section of the FDIC, as well as the State of Connecticut and our Banking Department, are very diligent and determined and I would tell you we spend an incredible amount of time on CRA and compliance issues. We all have CRA policies, compliance policies. It is basically built into every job. We just took on a compliance officer, and we are a bank of 30 people now and we brought in a compliance officer because you need the experience and just the ability to deliver all the reports to prove, even though you have never been accused or you have never had a complaint from your marketplace that you were discriminating in any way, you need the proof. You need to fill out the HMDA reports. It is a massive process and it is very detailed. So I think the job that is being done by the FDIC in that area is more than adequate, to the point where sometimes you step back and you say, the safety and soundness issues are more important to the longevity and soundness of the bank, as well as profitability of the bank, but we are spending an awful lot of time on just proving to people that we are doing things appropriately for the consumer.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Patterson.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","First, I would like to say that the Congress has been very helpful in looking at the issue of regulatory burden and testing the efficiencies and the effectiveness of regulations and giving us relief where you could and we are appreciative of that. Two points, simply. One is most of what we are here to talk about today was in the nonregulated area, and the commercial banks have not been the source of the problem and are not today and will not be in the future. But the second reason is I have a concern that if there is a separate agency that has that responsibility and the prudential agency has the overall responsibility, that you don't have the opportunity to look at the entity as one affects the other in a holistic way.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","How about if you build into the prudential regulator the idea of the Financial Product Safety Commissioner so it is part of it and they are not a separate entities.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I believe it already is the prudential regulator's role and I think that is where it should be, and I think it can be very effective and I think it has been. That is not where the problem has been.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Ms. Hillebrand, how do you respond to this? You are already involved in consumer protection, and know about these functions that are required of our community banks and regional banks and the like. In fact, I remember the CRA debate. During the largest debate, which was over Gramm-Leach- Bliley, I was not sitting in this chair. I was sitting several chairs down from here in that debate. We stayed up all night on Gramm-Leach-Bliley. People were going back and forth and talking about the whole notion of commerce and banking, and that is a legitimate question to have raised with that legislation. But the debate all night was, as we resolved those matters, was over CRA. That is how we came to the conclusion as to whether or not we could have a Community Reinvestment Act and how it would work, and ultimately resolved in favor of one. I love to point out to people, because I know there is an argument to the contrary, that if you look at institutions that follow CRA guidelines on mortgage lending and underwriting standards, only about 6 percent ended up in foreclosure. Where CRA was being followed and where the underwriting standards were adhered to, poorer people were actually getting into homes on terms they could afford. It is when you stepped out of that process with the no-doc loans, the liar loans, and the like, that this whole system fell apart. That, to me, is always going to be the root cause of all of this, in a sense. That was not a community banking issue, that was a different matter. But I wonder if you might respond to this point that Mr. Attridge and my community bankers raised. We are already doing this. We are working our heads off every single day at this stuff. You are going to overload us with some additional burdens here we can't possibly comply with.",Speech, 
"Ms. Hillebrand","Mr. Chairman, thank you for your earlier remarks about the Financial Product Safety Commission. We don't believe we will overload anyone who is treating their customer fairly and responsibly. This would create rules that apply across the board to make the products simple enough for the customer to use without those ``gotchas'' and tricks. Credit unions and community banks came very late to some of those tricks and traps, but when everyone else is doing it, it does create a pressure and it is a profit center for your competitors if they are doing it and you are not. That can be a problem. In addition, the bank regulatory model of supervision will still exist. There will still be safety and soundness regulation. Of course, consumer protection will still be a piece of safety and soundness. But what bank regulators look at is compliance. Was a current law broken? What the Financial Product Safety Commission would do is be an ``unfairness practices regulator'' where no current law has been broken. As the Wall Street Journal said recently about some hedge fund conduct, ``it was perfectly legal when it occurred.'' It would be those things the Financial Product Safety Commission would make rules about, not all of them, but the ones that go too far.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Whalen, do you want to comment on this.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","If one was creative, you might lessen the burden on institutions by going to a product-focused regulatory regime. In other words, don't make it a compliance checklist sort of exercise for the bank. Take that away from the bank management having to go through that as part of their exam process and instead just have a product focus by another agency. That might be a quid pro quo for the industry.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me ask you--I am jumping around here, but trying to wrap up. Forgive me for not remembering exactly which one of you embraced this view, but I mentioned Gramm- Leach-Bliley going back a number of years ago and the issue of whether or not you could create firewalls between traditional commercial activities and banking activities. One of you has advocated that actually the distinction between commerce and banking doesn't have much validity. Is that your opinion.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","If we live in the age of ``too big to fail,'' why bother with the Bank Holding Company Act? What is the point? That was supposed to be the firewall between the insured depository, where we have limits. I remember when I first----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","It doesn't have any authority. I mean, that was the Federal Reserve failing to regulate.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","When I first started working at the Fed, we had to memorize Section (4)(c)(8) of the Bank Holding Company Act so we knew what banks were allowed to sell credit insurance. The Congress had many such restrictions on bank activities and that limited their risk.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Are you still an advocate that we shouldn't have any distinction between commerce and banking.",Speech, 
"Mr. Whalen","I am because I think we are here now. I think we may have to invite the industrial sector into the financial sector at some point to provide new capital. But let me put it to you this way. There is a tension that has been illustrated in the last few months between the creditors of a bank holding company and the counterparties of the subsidiary bank. One could argue that the counterparties to the subsidiary bank, all of them, are now senior to the creditors of the parent bank holding company. I don't think that serves any public policy purpose. I would rather see the bank at the top issuing debt, issuing equity, issuing deposits, and paying a full load to the FDIC or whoever is the systemic risk regulator to contribute to the Resolution Fund.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me ask Mr. Patterson about that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","I do think in response to your direct comment that--and by the way, the encroachment by industrial firms raises a whole new set of issues as to----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","The ISCs, you are talking about.",Speech, 
"Mr. Patterson","Yes, how we can reach that arena. But the problems we are dealing with came from the nonbanks in great number. If it weren't for Gramm-Leach-Bliley, if you had not passed Gramm-Leach-Bliley, you wouldn't have had the availability of the solutions that we have had with B of A assuming the responsibility for Merrill Lynch, with Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley achieving bank holding company status. I am not saying that that was not in response to a crisis. It obviously was. But had there not been--had Gramm-Leach-Bliley not been on the books, those solutions would not have been available to us.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Any comment on that, Mr. Attridge.",Speech, 
"Mr. Attridge","I agree. It is complex enough now without allowing commercial enterprises to intermingle with the financial institutions. I just think it adds an additional level of risk. I think they have experienced that in Japan and that was one of the problems.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, you have been very patient. We have had you almost two-and-a-half hours here, and I apologize for taking that long. There are some additional questions we will submit for the record for you, and I am sure my colleagues will too. I want to apologize to my Republican colleagues. They had a meeting that they were asked to attend at 11. It came up at the last minute, and so they felt obligated, but I know they will have some questions. Of course, several of them stayed, but nonetheless, the rest of them could not be here this morning. We will have another hearing later this week on the subject matter relating to the issue of the regulatory architecture. This has been very helpful this morning. I want to stay in touch with you, as well. This has helped define the conversation. I am very intrigued. Mr. Attridge had some very provocative ideas, as well as Mr. Whalen, and the advice and counsel of Consumers Union, we always appreciate it. The ABA has been very active in participating over the years with us in this. We have moved our way through this, and, of course, the credit unions. We have 142 of them in Connecticut, so I want you to know, I am not unmindful of that. I bet Mr. Attridge could have told you exactly how many credit unions there are. I thank you all very, very much, and this Committee will stand adjourned.",Speech,
