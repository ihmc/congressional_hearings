"The Chairman","The hearing will come to order. At the request of the Minority, we will have opening statements. And the gentleman from Delaware is recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I will probably be briefer than that. I would like to thank the regulators who are here. Mr. Geithner this morning referenced the fact that while he recognizes there is some disagreement, he believes that it is protecting your territory, if you will. And I guess to some degree that is part of it. But I opine that I think it goes a little beyond that. I think we are very interested in what you have to say. I don't think there is any disagreement amongst any of us here that we do need to tighten the regulation of our financial services in this country. But how we do it and the creation of a new authority to look at products or whatever is a matter that is very important. Perhaps it needs to be done, but at least it is very important in terms of what we are doing. So I look forward to your testimony. I look forward to your reform recommendations, and I hope that we can continue to work together to make a difference. There was also yesterday a memorandum I think circulated among the Democratic Members about the CFPA bill, and we are very interested in that, in exactly where that is going. That is the bill in general. I am not sure what is in the memo per se. But that is something else we have to pay attention to. But we appreciate you being here and look forward to your testimony, and hopefully together we can do whatever is in the best interest of the country. I yield back, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Scott","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for this hearing. I want to start by thanking you, Ms. Bair, for your quick response and coming to the phone and talking with us about the particular situation in my home State of Georgia, where, as you know, unfortunately we almost got a double tragedy, of course, with the flooding that is going on there now, but, of course, with our flood of bank foreclosures. And I appreciate your comments on that and doing everything we can to stem the tide of losing banks. That is an unfortunate thing that my State, unfortunately, leads the Nation in this regard. I guess my major concern that I want to certainly put before this panel today, and I will get to some of it in my questions, simply that the fact that there needs to be a heightened awareness and interest and emphasis placed upon what we are doing and must do to reclaim the confidence of the American people in our economic system. We have, I think, played a much heavier hand and placed a greater interest on dealing with our banks, Wall Street, who are apparently getting well now, under the belief that as we move forward with unfreezing the credit markets and making sure that we help bail out Wall Street, we have forgotten to place the necessary emphasis on doing something to help Main Street, to help people. So now here we are with unemployment hovering at 10 and 11 percent, and in some communities they are at Depression levels. I think there ought to be something for us to discuss today on what we are going to do as we move forward to make sure we are getting jobs created in this country, because that, in all reasoning, is the key to getting our economy back moving. It is jobs. Unemployment continues to go up. And as we spoke, Ms. Bair--and unfortunately home foreclosure rates are continuing to go up. So the fundamental question becomes to me is there seems to be a freezing of the arteries within the banking system. We need to get to the fundamental reason why banks are not lending, why are they not lending, especially to small businesses which create the jobs? And with that I will yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 2\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the chairman, and I will just be brief. Just a couple of points. One is to follow up on the point that Mr. Castle was raising a moment ago. We find ourselves on this side of the table in somewhat of a quandary as to where we should go for the expertise in the reform that we are looking to do for this country. And I preface that by saying that contrary to what some people would like to say, some people have said earlier this morning, that there are some out there who see no need whatsoever for reform in this marketplace, there is no one, there is no one on either side of the aisle who believes that no reform is necessary. Everyone agrees that mistakes were made in the past, and we need to sit down and hopefully in a bipartisan manner try to fix the situation. But doing so, those of us somewhat laymen in these topical areas look to those who sit on that side of the table for the expertise in order to bring us this. Earlier, as Mr. Castle said and as I said during the earlier hearing, as I am sure was pointed out to you, the Treasury Secretary makes the point that when we hear from the regulators, that they have their own particular areas of--their own particular areas of interests and concerns, their own turf battles that they are working on. The question that I couldn't put back to him was that if that is the case, then why in the world would the Administration be suggesting that we should actually expand that authority and expand that power to those very same bureaucrats, if you will, or regulators, if all they are interested in is looking at their narrow area of responsibility? I wasn't able to give that question to the Secretary, but I will allow you to touch upon that if that is an area. And the other question, I guess, I would like to hear from you is we now have several different proposals. We have the Administration's proposal coming out. And I understand the chairman has said with regard to CFP, trying to narrow that in. And I think the chairman has gone at least in the right direction of that as to who they would apply to. Mr. Hensarling from Texas was trying to hear from the Secretary whether we really are going to narrow that into, as to which financial institutions should be covered and what have you. I would be curious from the panel as well as to where the panel comes in on those issues as well, whether the chairman is going closer in the direction to where we were originally, that this should really be looking at banking institutions and the areas where the problems were in the first place and not in the rest of the financial market; or is the Administration correct and just say this is much broader than that, and we should be applying a program of reform to an area that really the problems didn't originate from and start trying to impose bank regulations on an area where we know that those bank regulations didn't work in the past. I appreciate your testimony."
"The Chairman","I will recognize myself now for 4 minutes. That will use up our time, and then the gentleman from Texas will use up time from the other side in total. I will be dealing with some of the consumer issues. And let me say to my friends, the regulators, I welcome a chance to have a serious conversation with you about consumer affairs. I must tell you that I don't remember too many of those in the past. It does appear to be of minute interest in consumer affairs from some of you, consumer protections. But I want to talk about the continuing problem we have dealt with before. The gentleman from Georgia alluded to it. I appreciate the fact that those of you who are regulators here have been urging the people who work for you, the examiners, to encourage responsible lending. But I am afraid from all the information I get that we are not there yet. Now, I understand that there is the problem of a culture in which you work. I think it is probably the case that no examiner in history has been in serious trouble for a loan that didn't get made. There have been examiners who have found themselves in difficulty because they were accused of allowing loans to be made that shouldn't have been made. I have sympathy for the people who do these jobs, and they are sometimes caught in the shifting winds. But I just emphasize again--and I appreciate that, Chairman Bair, you attended a meeting in Nevada recently, very much appreciated by Congresswoman Berkeley and the others from Nevada. And we have this constant--many of us across the aisle, we are told by the community bankers that they find the examiners difficult in terms of the lending. And you say, and I believe you completely, that you were trying to ease that. I just would emphasize that it takes constant work. We are trying to change culture and change incentives. We need to keep doing this, because the sense that the regulators on the ground, your representatives on the ground, are not in sync with what you are saying in Washington continues. I am sure it is not entirely fair, but when you go into our line of work, you waive your right to not deal with things that are unfair. And perception is part of reality. So this is really very, very important for us, for you to do. Secondly, obviously the Chair has a serious responsibility with regard to the fund, and I do believe that there have been unduly alarmist views about the insurance fund. And I welcome the chance, Chairman Bair, for you to address that and reassure people. We have been at this for a very long time. The deposit insurance has been one of the great successes in regulation and economic activity, and we will continue that. I will say--and this is a choice for you to make--I understand that there is a need for increased funding. It does seem to me that it would be procyclical in the wrong way to raise the assessment now. There have been people who say if you don't raise the assessments on the banks, you are subsidizing the banks. No, let us be very clear. No one is talking about anything other than a loan to the fund. Now, where the money comes from will still be discussed. But it seems to me the case is overwhelming for there to be loans to the fund to be paid back by the banks in their assessments, but in the future; that is, to make it countercyclical rather than procyclical. This is not the time to raise the assessments on the banks. We will have money lent, I hope, to the fund, which will be paid back out of assessments. And if we are successful with our regulation, and things work well, and the economy works well, we may well get another period where--I don't know how long it was we didn't have any bank failures, 10 years or more. If we get back into such a period, as we all hope we do, the assessments, the loans can then be paid back under existing assessments without any increase. So I do want to refute the notion that by forgoing an assessment increase today and instead borrowing the money, we are somehow letting the banks off the hook. We are simply saying that, yes, we understand that the banks will have to pay for this, but it will be far better from everybody's standpoint to defer that repayment until the better time that we hope is coming. My time has expired. The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield to the ranking member."
"Mr. Bachus","I just wanted to acknowledge that there are two funds at the FDIC, and one is the contingent loss fund of $30 billion that you do never hear about. And I don't--obviously there are challenges, but I appreciate the chairman mentioning that."
"Mr. Neugebauer","I thank the ranking member, and I thank the chairman for holding this hearing today. Obviously, there is a lot of discussion out there about regulatory reform. And I think everyone agrees there were some flaws in the current system, and we need to look at ways to make the system better. I think while we have--different ideas have been put forward on how best to accomplish that, and quite honestly, as we had Treasury Secretary Geithner in here, he has a different perspective particularly when it comes to consumer protection. In fact, to be blunt, he wants to fire our witnesses from the consumer protection. And I don't know how you feel about being fired, but that is his proposal. And so the question I had for him today, and Chairman Frank indicated earlier that you have a lackluster performance in the consumer protection area, and the question is, if you think that you need to continue to hold that role, why do you think that you should do that? And evidently your testimony previously has been that you think that bifurcating that is not a good process. I tend to agree with that. But I think one of the questions that you all are going to have to answer is what--why should you get to keep that if, in fact, you missed the boat in this previous round? One of the things that we are moving down a road that I think many of us are concerned about is that we seem to be moving to consumer protection, but many of us think that we are taking away consumer choices. I think we have to be very careful with that, because the consumers are--quite honestly, when given the right information, are very smart, and I think disclosure helps them make the choices in their best interests. I don't think they particularly want the Federal Government to do that. I think one of the things that--the analogy that I would use here is that we seem to be moving in a direction where little Johnnie gets hurt on the playground, and so we go and remove the playground so that Johnnie doesn't get hurt again. The truth is Johnnie likes the playground. Consumers like the choices they have. They like a lot of the financial products that they have, and they are very concerned that the Federal Government is about to take the playground away, and I don't think that they support that. I don't support that. But what we do need to do is make sure that we have a regulatory structure that protects the investments of the people who are involved in those transactions, but also provides a robust financial market for consumers to be able to have good choices for their products."
"The Chairman","The time for opening statements has been consumed. And we will now begin with the Chair of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Chairwoman Bair. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE SHEILA C. BAIR, CHAIRMAN, FEDERAL DEPOSIT INSURANCE CORPORATION"," "
"Ms. Bair","Thank you, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to return this afternoon to continue testifying on reforming the Nation's financial regulatory system. Differences in the regulation of capital, leverage, and consumer protection and the almost complete lack of regulation of over-the-counter derivatives created an environment in which regulatory arbitrage became rampant. Reforms are urgently needed to close those gaps. At the same time, we must recognize that much of the risk in the system involved firms that are already subject to extensive financial regulation. One of the lessons of the past few years is that regulation alone is not enough to control imprudent risk taking with our dynamic and complex financial system. So at the top of the must-do list is a need to stop future bailouts and reinstill market discipline. The government needs a way to say no. We need a statutory mechanism to resolve large financial institutions in an orderly fashion that is similar to what we have for depository institutions. While this process can be painful for shareholders and creditors, it is necessary, and it works. Unfortunately, measures taken during the year, while necessary to stabilize credit markets, have only reinforced the doctrine that some financial firms are simply ``too-big-to- fail.'' In fact, the markets are more concentrated than before. We also need disincentives for excessive growth in risk- taking. We need a better way of supervising systemically important institutions and a framework that proactively identifies risks before they threaten the financial system. We have called for a strong oversight council with rulemaking authority. It would closely monitor the system for problems such as excessive leverage, inadequate capital and overreliance on short-term funding, and have a clear statutory mandate to act to prevent systemwide risks. Finally, the FDIC strongly supports creation of a Consumer Financial Protection Agency as a stand-alone Federal regulator. As embodied in H.R. 3126, the agency would eliminate regulatory gaps between bank and nonbank financial products and services by setting robust national standards for consumer protection. However, it is essential to focus examination and enforcement on the nonbank sector to protect consumers from some of the most abusive products and practices. We believe this bill would be even stronger if amended to include a well-defined mechanism that provides oversight of nonbanks in partnership with State regulators. To be sure, there is much to be done if we are to prevent another financial crisis, but at a minimum we need to scrap the ``too-big-to-fail'' doctrine, set up a strong oversight council to prevent systemic risk, and create a strong consumer watchdog that offers real protection from abusive financial products and services. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Chairman Bair can be found on page 49 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Comptroller Dugan. "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JOHN C. DUGAN, COMPTROLLER, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY"," "
"Mr. Dugan","Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, I appreciate this opportunity to continue where we left off last time in discussing the Treasury Department's proposal for regulatory reform. As I testified in July, the OCC supports many elements of the proposal, including the establishment of a council of financial regulators to identify and monitor systemic risk and enhanced authority to resolve systemically significant financial firms. We also believe it would be appropriate to extend consolidated supervision to all systemically significant financial firms. The Federal Reserve already plays this role for the largest bank holding companies, but during the financial crisis, the absence of a comparable supervisor for large securities and insurance firms proved to be an enormous problem. The proposal would fill this gap by extending the Federal Reserve's holding company regulation to such firms which we believe would be appropriate. However, one aspect of the proposal goes much too far, which is to grant broad new authority to the Federal Reserve to override the primary banking supervisor on standards, examination, and enforcement applicable to the bank. Such override power would alter our present working relationship with the Federal Reserve that works very well and fundamentally undermine the authority and accountability of the banking supervisor. We also support the imposition of more stringent capital and liquidity standards on systemically significant financial firms. This would help address their heightened risk to the system and mitigate the competitive advantage they could realize from being designated as systemically significant. Similarly, the OCC supports the proposals calling for more forward-looking loan loss provisioning, which is an issue that I have spent a great deal of time on as co-Chairman of the Financial Stability Board's Working Group on Provisioning. Unfortunately, our current system unacceptably discourages banks from building reserves during good times when they can most afford it, and requires them to take larger provisions for loan losses during downturns when it weakens vulnerable banks and inhibits needed lending. And we support the proposal to effectively merge the OTS into the OCC. Finally, we support enhanced consumer financial protection standards and believe that a dedicated consumer protection agency, the CFPA, could help achieve that goal. However, we have significant concerns with the parts of the proposed CFPA that would consolidate all financial consumer protection rulewriting, examination, and enforcement in one agency, which would completely divorce these functions from safety and soundness regulation. It makes sense to consolidate all consumer protection rulewriting in a single agency with the rules applying to all financial providers of a product, both bank and nonbank, but we believe the rules must be uniform, and that banking supervisors must have meaningful input into formulating them, and unfortunately, the proposed CFPA falls short on two counts. First, the rules would not be uniform because the proposal would expressly authorize States to adopt different rules for all financial firms, including national banks, by repealing the Federal preemption that has always allowed national banks to operate under uniform Federal standards. This repeal of the uniform Federal standards option is a radical change that will make it far more difficult and costly for national banks to provide financial services to consumers in different States having different rules, and these costs will ultimately be borne by the consumer. The change will also undermine the national banking charter and the dual banking system that has served us well for nearly 150 years. Second, the rules do not afford meaningful input from banking supervisors, even on real safety and soundness issues, because in the event of any dispute, the proposed CFPA would always win. The new agency needs to have a strong mechanism for ensuring meaningful bank supervisor input into the CFPA rulemaking. Finally, the banking agencies should continue to be responsible for examination and enforcement, not the CFPA. I believe there are real benefits to an integrated approach to consumer compliance and safety and soundness exams, a process that I think has worked well over time. Moreover, moving bank examination and enforcement functions to the CFPA would only distract it from its most important and most daunting implementation challenge, which is establishing an effective enforcement regime for the shadow banking system of the tens of thousands of nonbank providers that are currently unregulated or lightly regulated, like nonbank mortgage brokers and originators. We believe the CFPA's resources should be focused on this fundamental regulatory gap rather than on already regulated depository institutions. Thank you.

"The Chairman","Mr. Bowman. "
"STATEMENT OF JOHN E. BOWMAN, ACTING DIRECTOR, OFFICE OF THRIFT SUPERVISION"," "
"Mr. Bowman","Good afternoon, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. When I testified here 2 months ago, my remarks concentrated on addressing real problems underlying the financial crisis. In my written testimony today, I debunk the myth of regulatory arbitrage by the industry. In my brief remarks here this afternoon, I would also like to emphasize that we will not solve the potential problems of tomorrow by merging regulatory agencies. There are five reasons why consolidation would neither solve those problems, nor promote efficiency, especially if the thrift charter is preserved. First, as you know, the OTS conducts consolidated supervision of thrifts and their holding companies. Although I do not believe the OTS is the proper regulator for systemically important conglomerates, I think it makes perfect sense for the agency to continue to supervise thrift holding companies, particularly for the many local consumer and community lenders across America who should not be asked to bear the cost and the inefficiency of a separate holding company regulatory scheme. Although larger thrifts tend to get the headlines, the overwhelming majority of thrifts are small, conservative lenders that offer home mortgages, car loans, and other day-to- day financial services to people in towns and cities, suburban and rural, across the country. Quite a few are community-based mutual institutions--much like the Bailey Building and Loan in the movie, ``It's a Wonderful Life''--that had been integral parts of their communities for decades. They did not contribute to the financial crisis, and they should not have to pay for it. The health of the financial services industry is improving, but it is by no means robust. The transition cost of thrifts converting to a different supervisor and a separate holding company regulator would be an unnecessary burden at a difficult time. My second point also relates to the fact there is no efficiency to be gained by merging regulatory agencies that do not fit together. Currently, thrifts report their financial status to the OTS through quarterly thrift financial reports, while banks file call reports under consolidation proposals. Either thrifts would need to spend money to overhaul their financial reporting systems, or the consolidated agency would need to operate and maintain two different reporting systems. Either approach would undercut efficiency. The third point is that trillion-dollar megabanks have almost nothing in common with small community thrifts. If these different types of businesses were supervised by a single regulator, the needs of the community-oriented majority could be too often overlooked by a bureaucracy forced to focus on the institutions that pose the greatest risks to the financial system. A fourth point is that multiple viewpoints among regulators foster better decisionmaking. OTS's leadership of banning unfair credit card practices is just one example. Remember that countries with a single monolithic bank regulator fared no better than the United States during this financial crisis we are currently undergoing. My fifth and final point dovetails with the first two. Consolidating agencies would take years, cost the industry millions of dollars, and generate upheaval in the day-to-day supervision of the financial institutions. All of this would be done to achieve a forced fit of fundamentally different agencies that regulate the fundamentally different charters and institutions; in effect, trying to pound a square peg into a round hole with no efficiencies or other benefits for taxpayers, consumers or the industry. To reiterate my remarks to this committee 2 months ago, the proposed consolidation could not address the problems that caused the financial crisis or could cause the next one. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman. I am happy to respond to your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Bowman can be found on page 65 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Next--and I am very proud that we have maintained the rule here of including our State colleagues in banking, insurance and in regulation and securities. There are people who consider you State regulators a nuisance, but we think you are an important part of the system. So we have Mr. Joseph Smith, who is the North Carolina Commissioner of Banks, and he is here on behalf of the Conference of State Bank Supervisors. "
"STATEMENT OF JOSEPH A. SMITH, JR., NORTH CAROLINA COMMISSIONER OF BANKS, ON BEHALF OF THE CONFERENCE OF STATE BANK SUPERVISORS"," "
"Mr. Smith","Chief nuisance, right. Good afternoon, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and distinguished members of the committee. I appreciate the opportunity to continue our discussion of financial services regulatory reform. First and foremost, the decisions that you make will determine the industry's structure and its impact on communities, small businesses, and consumers across the country. My colleagues and I are very concerned that we could end up with a highly concentrated and consolidated industry that holds too much sway over the Federal Government and is unmoved by the needs of consumers and communities. The States have made the industry--that is, the financial services industry--more diverse and accountable. You see this in the fact that the States have chartered over two-thirds of the Nation's 8,000 banks, and you see this in the fact that the States serve as incubators and models for consumer protection. We hope that we can agree that the outcome of reform cannot be less diversity and less accountability, and yet we are hearing proposals that will undermine both diversity and accountability, proposals that will drive us towards greater centralization and consolidation. In our view, a consolidated banking system and industry would be in conflict with the health of our State and local economies and would further erode public confidence. I would like to make a few brief points on some specific issues and proposals. First, it is important to preserve the role of State law and the role of the States to set and enforce tougher consumer protection standards. Nationally chartered banks must not be able to hide behind preemptive regulatory declarations, declarations that are directly contrary to long- standing congressional intent. We oppose any effort to undermine the provisions in H.R. 3126, preserving the ability of the States to set and enforce tougher consumer protection standards. Second, creating a single monolithic regulator as a means of improving financial regulation relies on the faulty assumption that regulator consolidation leads to a safer and stronger banking system. Such a structure would diminish regulatory accountability and discipline. It would lead to further industry consolidation and facilitate regulatory capture by the Nation's largest financial institutions. A single Federal regulator, a regulator that both charters and examines national banks and examines State-chartered institutions, would irreparably harm the dual banking system and the diversity that is the hallmark of that system. Finally, regulatory reform must directly address and end ``too-big-to-fail.'' This means regulatory safeguards to prevent growth driven by excessive risk-taking and leverage, a clear path for resolving large interconnected institutions, and no discretionary safety net. Only in this manner will we be able to preserve the financial system's stability and protect taxpayers from potential unlimited liability from failed firms. As always, sir, it is an honor to appear before you. Thank you very much. I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Mr. Smith can be found on page 132 of the appendix.]"
"The Chairman","Thank you. I will begin the questioning. And I know that there are questions that some of the regulators have about their authority and whether it is turf or not. So, Mr. Bowman, you spoke out against the abolition of the OCC and the OTS and their becoming one national entity. You thought that was a mistake. Mr. Dugan, what do you think about the proposal to replace the current OCC and OTS with one national bank supervisor?"
"Mr. Dugan","Mr. Chairman, as I put it in my written remarks from last time--"
"The Chairman","I apologize for not reading them, Mr. Dugan. I do not always do my homework. Pull the microphone a little closer, please."
"Mr. Dugan","Sorry. I support the proposal in that kind of consolidation."
"The Chairman","Mr. Bowman, you don't agree with the argument that this is consolidation, it doesn't make sense? I am wondering whether--let me say there does seem to be some analogy here with the consumer protection. That is, people seem to be in favor of other people losing their jurisdiction much more than they are of their own. That is not surprising. But to Mr. Bowman, the arguments against the consumer agency are the same as against a consolidation, which most people think is more the OTS moving into the OCC. You do not. I am not surprised. I just want to say I do think institutional position does have some impact on people's views on this. Let me ask you further on the question of the importance of leaving the consumer function with the safety and soundness regulator. Now, I have agreed with that to some extent; not the consumer function, that is why one of the differences that I have with the Administration had to do with the Community Reinvestment Act. That does seem to me to be very much, when we talk about volumes of loans, etc., safety and soundness. But I am a little troubled by the implication that a good enforcement of the credit card law or rules about truth in lending or others, that those somehow would implicate safety and soundness. Is that the argument, that we are afraid that if people enforce consumer protection laws too vigorously, this will call into question safety and soundness?"
"Mr. Dugan?",""
"Mr. Dugan","No. That is not exactly what I meant. What I meant was as we do our supervision for safety and soundness, we often find consumer protection issues and vice versa. And I attached a bunch of real-world examples."
"The Chairman","That is fine. Will there be anything preventing you from telling the agency--it did seem to me the way this is presented--and I will tell you this gets into the discussion--that there is somehow something risky about separating consumer protection for safety and soundness, because obviously safety and soundness is of prime importance. So you are not suggesting that this is going to be riskier. When you say you don't want safety and soundness separated from consumer protection, you are not suggesting that this would in any way undercut safety and soundness?"
"Mr. Dugan","There are some places it could undermine safety and soundness in the Administration's proposal because--"
"The Chairman","Which parts?"
"Mr. Dugan","To the extent that there is a dispute about whether there is a safety and soundness issue, the way it is currently drafted, the CFPA would always win."
"The Chairman","Okay. So our proposal, which is going to have a way in which that is decided between the agencies--and I want to deal with this. But you do believe that safety and soundness--I guess the implicit point there is that too vigorous a protection of consumer rights might somehow implicate safety and soundness; otherwise you would have a dispute. And your problem is it is one-sided. Our proposal will--and by the way, people have described us as moving away. I haven't moved away from anything. I didn't have anything to start with. I never liked ``plain vanilla.'' As I have said, I remember the days when the bars had to serve food if they were going to serve liquor, and they served some of the most God-awful food known to human beings. And I think trying to force someone to do good is a very, very qualitatively different and, I think, often futile effort rather than preventing them from doing bad. I have never been much of a compulsory do-gooder. But if we were to have a mechanism which allowed for a fair resolution and even maybe weighted more towards the bank regulators of a dispute, would there still be a safety and soundness issue?"
"Mr. Dugan","I think that would help, but that is not the only issue."
"The Chairman","I understand that. And I understand that-- Chairwoman Bair, again, do you see--is it a safety and soundness issue if we separate out consumer protection from you?"
"Ms. Bair","I think it is an examination quality issue."
"The Chairman","Okay. But is it a safety and soundness issue?"
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think there could be conflicts."
"The Chairman","But if we resolve the conflicts. It might be if there was a conflict between the two?"
"Ms. Bair","As an insurer for all banks, you do need to have some emphasis on safety and soundness, too. The government is ultimately at risk for the viability of the institutions."
"The Chairman","I understand that, but I do think it is important for the safety and soundness regulators to be able to say, wait a minute, you have gone too far. Although do you think in general that vigorous consumer law enforcement undercuts safety and soundness?"
"Ms. Bair","No. Just the opposite. I think a good quality consumer compliance examination function complements and supports safety and soundness."
"The Chairman","My time has expired. The gentleman from Texas."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to go back to some of the comments I made in my opening statement. Chairman Bair, we will start with you. What was the FDIC doing in relationship to consumer protection, say, over the last 5 or 10 years? In other words--because quite honestly, as I said, some folks don't think you all were doing anything."
"Ms. Bair","The first thing I would like to say is we don't have the authority to write consumer rules. We have never had that. That has always been vested in the Federal Reserve Board. Two years ago, I came to this committee and asked for the ability to do that. Mr. Dugan did the same thing. I will be happy to give you our comment letters to the Federal Reserve Board on subprime lending, on yield spread premiums, on credit cards, and on overdraft protection. We have vigorously pressed for a number of years for stronger consumer protections in key areas. My examiners are only as good as the rules they have to enforce. So that is that. Number two, in enforcing the rules we do have, we have done a reasonable job. Could we do better? Yes. That has been one of the things that I have tried to do as Chairman of the FDIC. We have increased the number of our compliance examiners, we have increased and streamlined our General Counsel section that brings these enforcement cases, and overall, we do have a pretty good record. I am happy to give you the numbers concerning our enforcement cases if you would like. We care about consumer protection. We care about protecting bank customers. No, we don't want to lose that. And if you want to call that turf, that is fine, but that is who we are."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you. So your response, let me be clear, is that in response to the consumer protection, you weren't doing anything, what you are saying is in that area, for example, FDIC, you do not feel like you had any jurisdictional authority to address consumer issues?"
"Ms. Bair","We feel we did not have strong enough rules against abuses like overdraft protection and credit card and subprime lending. Our subprime lending cases were brought as safety and soundness cases because those weren't prudent loans either. But we didn't have rules in place to tackle it from a consumer protection standpoint."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Mr. Dugan, is that your position as well?"
"Mr. Dugan","It is similar. We also did not have any rulewriting authority in this area. But we did have considerable examination and enforcement responsibilities with respect to the rules that were on the books, and we think we did a decent job with that. I would make one other very fundamental point, though. A number of the problems that caused the crisis, while consumer protection contributed to it, a big chunk of that was pure and simple underwriting problems. A big chunk of that was outside of the banking system. And we did not have any authority over that in terms of examining and supervising it, and even the rules that were adopted didn't apply to them. And so you had this uneven world where you had two different systems applying to the regulated and the unregulated, and that was a fundamental problem."
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Dugan."
"Mr. Bowman?",""
"Mr. Bowman","Yes. Two examples. First, we do have some rulewriting authority in terms of consumer complaints, and we took the lead in coming up with an unfair and deceptive acts and practices rule that related to credit card practices and other activities. Second, we have additional authority as it relates to deceptive advertising and issues like that, which we have used to enforce consumer rules and regulations against those institutions we regulate and their holding companies. Fair lending referrals to the Department of Justice have been fairly constant throughout. In the last couple of years, formal enforcement actions brought against our institutions are up somewhat dramatically as a result of increased consumer complaints that we are receiving. But I would share Comptroller Dugan's concern about the number of consumer complaints and abuses that existed outside of the regulated depository institution area where we don't have the authority to regulate or oversee. One of the advantages, in my opinion, of something like the Consumer Financial Products Agency, would be a uniform set of regulations that would be applicable to all providers of consumer products and services."
"Mr. Neugebauer","My time is limited. So what I hear you all saying is, if you had the rules, if you had a uniform set of rules, that individually your agencies are capable of enforcing that and making that a part of your standard regulatory process. But what you are saying, in defense of what others have said about taking that just totally away from you, is that you haven't really been given the opportunity to execute that with the proper rulemaking authority. Is that what I am hearing you say?"
"Ms. Bair","I think the examination and enforcement apparatus with regard to banks is already in place. Give us stronger rules, and you can immediately leverage those resources. I would absolutely echo what Comptroller Dugan said, especially that many consumer abuses in mortgages occurred outside regulated depository institutions. If we have strong rules, we have the examination forces and capabilities to enforce them. With the existing rules, we have had 639 total formal and informal consumer actions since 2006. We also have had another 91 referrals to the Department of Justice for fair lending. We have a good record of enforcing the rules that we have in place now."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. I am going to recognize the gentlewoman from New York, and I will ask her to just give me 30 seconds of her time. If I could just say that I am a great admirer of Chairman Bair and of Mr. Dugan. In fact, I actively urged your continuation in your reappointment. But I have to be honest with you, in all the conversations we have had, I do not remember either of you ever coming to me and saying, here is this consumer problem. You have come to me, as you should, with problems in the regulatory area, in the financing area, etc., but I do not recall either of you ever coming to me and saying that you didn't have strong enough rules. I do not recall either of you ever coming to me and saying, here is a defect in consumer protection, as you often did in your general area."
"Ms. Bair","Mr. Chairman, I will provide my previous testimony. We have absolutely testified about the need for additional consumer protection authority."
"The Chairman","I will apologize if that is the case, because my recollection is that you have been much more energetic with us on those other areas and not on consumer protection. But--"
"Mr. Dugan","I would be happy to respond to that as well."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from New York. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the hearings from this morning and this afternoon, and I appreciate the testimony that we have been hearing. This is a learning curve for a lot of people. Hopefully, a lot of people are watching this on TV so they can actually hear what went down over the past year. And to be very honest with you, it is a learning session for many Members. We sit here on the committee, but there are many Members who are sitting outside that really have no idea what we are talking about. These are difficult subjects. And if you are not in the financial world, it is extremely difficult for the average person to even pick this up. Now, I guess the questions that I want to go to, again, go to the Consumer Financial Protection Agency and what the rules and regulations are going to be. There are many who feel we definitely need something like this, and I am one of them. But we also want to make sure as we do this, we are not going to strangle those corporations that we are trying to help, so they are healthy. It is a fine line when you start to think about it. But I guess one of the things that I would like to have an answer--and I apologize if it was in the full context of your words--but how would a conflict between the agency and a regulatory be solved? And who is going to be on the top of that to make those decisions when you bring all these together?"
"Ms. Bair","I think subprime is an example. Early on, when subprime expanded, it was viewed positively. Lenders that were making these loans were getting some plaudits in the media and elsewhere because they were broadening homeownership. As we saw later, these loans didn't perform, and they weren't serving anyone's interest because long-term, they weren't affordable. There can be differences in perspective on this, and you need synergies between the two. You need both perspectives to be able to evaluate a practice. This is one example of where a tool originally introduced in the nonbank sector spilled into banks. This tool, a type of mortgage product that was originally touted by those offering it as a way to expand homeownership, really ended up hurting a lot of people. But early on, nobody caught it on the safety and soundness side or the consumer protection side. This type of thing can happen in benign environments if a product appears to look good. With a low teaser rate, you can buy a house for a couple of years and figure it out later. Or you can have have a very low downpayment. Ultimately, we saw that did not work. In more benign times, you can get into a situation where a product that looks on the surface like it is going to be proconsumer is actually not. If you look deeper in terms of underwriting quality, it is not in the consumer's long-term interest and certainly not in the lender's long-term interest."
"Mr. Dugan","I would just echo those remarks. If you only have one set of views, I think you can have problems in emphasizing that aspect of it if you don't have them both blended together and balanced, one against the other, when you have an issue like that. Nontraditional mortgages, the payment option mortgages, were something we identified very early on as having both safety and soundness problems and underwriting problems. We began to try to take action in the national banking system, as my fellow banking regulators did. We couldn't get at the place that was really cranking them out because we didn't have rules that applied in that area. So I think you would need a mixture of the two, and the notion that you can completely separate them gives us pause. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. One of the other things I just want to bring up, and, Chairman Bair, we had talked about this. If you watch TV, and it doesn't matter whether it is early in the morning or late at night or the middle of the day, we are still seeing a tremendous amount, in my opinion, of predatory lenders on TV. I know it is not particularly in this committee that we can deal with it, but this is a perfect example where I see the two entities of different parts of the government aren't working together. We are here talking about--talking about giving consumers protection, and it is blasted all over the TV, it is on every telephone pole in my area: We will get you insurance, we will get you your loan for your house, no downpayment. How far have we actually come on protecting our consumers?"
"Ms. Bair","Congresswoman, that is right. Banks are not doing this. If they were banks, we could stop it. We have both rules now. The Fed finally moved forward with rules under the Home Owner's Equity Protection Act and we have an enforcement mechanism for banks. The nonbank sector is lightly regulated or virtually unregulated in many, if not most, of these areas, and it is a daunting task to try to identify those people, get them registered, get them licensed, and have some type of examination and enforcement mechanism. That is really where the void is, and that is where the focus of this new agency should be. That, in and of itself, is a daunting task. So we think the best leverage in examination and enforcement resources is for this new agency to write rules for everybody, but on the enforcement side focus on nonbank financial service providers that, you are absolutely right, are still out there. Mrs. McCarthy of New York. I thank you all for your testimony."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Delaware."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bair, you have opined in the past at some time or another that the creation of the CFPA may not solve the fundamental causes of the mortgage crisis, and that concerns me. You had a lot of entities that weren't even banking entities issuing mortgages. Obviously earnings statements by the people obtaining the mortgages weren't always obtained. There are a lot of fundamental problems with that, and my concern is that if we are to create this particular new agency, and it doesn't have the authority to deal with those problems or the mechanical ability to deal with those problems, that would be an issue. But I am also concerned what happens if we don't create the agencies in terms of how do we catch these problems that apparently we didn't catch before. I would be interested in your comments on that."
"Ms. Bair","You need the CFPA because you need strong rules across-the-board for banks and nonbanks. There has been a lot of arbitrage between the more heavily regulated banking sector and the nonbanking sector. Unless you have a new agency that not only writes rules for both banks and nonbanks, but also has some viable examination and enforcement mechanism for the nonbank sector, you are not going to address the problem. We can keep regulating banks and deploy more examiners. But if somebody else can offer a loan that is completely outside that framework, you are not going to solve the problem. Banks will lose more market share or this will put competitive pressure on them to lower their standards, which is exactly what happened with subprime mortgages. There really needs to be a laserlike focus on the nonbank sector. You don't fix that problem unless you make sure you have both rules and enforcement mechanisms that apply across- the-board."
"Mr. Castle","In short, it is the nonbank sector that is the disturbing part of it as far as you are concerned?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes. You have to deal with that, or you are not going to solve the problem."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you. Mr. Dugan, how important is uniformity in setting the standards for national banks? And what do you see as some of the problems raised by the Administration's proposal to establish a Consumer Financial Protection Agency which at the same time allows the 50 States to set their own standards for national banks operating within their borders? It seems to me you are getting into a double structure there, and I would be interested in your comments on that."
"Mr. Dugan","You put your finger on a very important point. As we were just talking about, there has been a rulewriting gap in not having uniform standards. The notion of having a new agency that could set some uniform rules at the national level is a very powerful and good thing. But in the same breath, I think you undermine this principle by then inviting the States to add additional rules on each of these areas. And in a world in which the delivery of financial products and services, particularly national banks that operate across State borders, it is a technology that doesn't respect boundaries. If you have ATM cards or credit cards or debit cards or instant credit checks, you have a world in which you touch many States, and the efficient delivery of it requires a single set of rules. That is what has allowed a lot of these products to flourish, and I think the danger you would have is twofold by having many different standards apply. First, you would have a lot more cost in figuring out how to comply with 50 different rules on how to disclose things, an account opening, interest rates, or rules on compensation. Second, you create tremendous legal uncertainty and exposure in different areas by having different rules and not knowing which States' rules would apply. And the problem is that those costs will get passed on to consumers either in the form of higher prices or less availability of the products and services."
"Mr. Smith","Excuse me, Representative Castle, may I respond to that as well?"
"Mr. Castle","Let me ask another question, Commissioner. You can respond to that one and the one I am going to ask next, if you will. This is to Mr. Dugan as well. Do you think that the creation of CFPA will result in less competition and higher costs, which you just indicated it would, but would force the multi-State banks to operate in, say, one bank, just California and New York or whatever--one State, excuse me, California, New York or whatever it may be. Are you going to see more of that if this were to--"
"Mr. Dugan","I don't know if that would happen, but I think you can have circumstances where rather than incur the compliance costs of a bunch of different rules, they would take a particular large State, and, if it had a different rule, try to conform their systems to that one State, even if it is different from the rules adopted at the national level pursuant to notice and comment pursuant to all the deliberative process that the new CFPA would have. It would undermine that thought. I think you could have a real issue there."
"Mr. Castle","Commissioner Smith, you have a little more time."
"The Chairman","Well, I would ask unanimous consent to--he is a State bank supervisor representative, and it is a very relevant question. I would ask unanimous consent that he get an additional minute to respond to the question."
"Mr. Smith","I will try. First of all, sir, if I might say so, we have just had a financial meltdown under subprime. The States were all over subprime for years. No one has ever said, to my knowledge, that the State regulation caused the subprime crisis. In fact, if anything, the State regulation was on top of the subprime crisis before anybody else. It is astonishing to me to hear the regulators of enterprises that have lost billions of dollars somehow related to subprime say they weren't involved then. This is an astonishing proposition. It seems to me in cases where there are appropriate Federal standards or where Federal standards are enforced, the States have other things to do right now than fry these fish. We will work with the Federal Government. We have worked with the Federal Government on the SAFE Act. We thank you for adopting that. Forty-nine States have adopted similar legislation to license mortgage originators so that we can get our arms around this issue, and we have been doing this stuff for years. So I think it is really quite unfair to say that allowing States to have higher standards to protect consumers somehow damages the financial system."
"The Chairman","Well, it is an appropriate segue to the gentleman from North Carolina, who has been a leading activist here in the subprime crisis, and I am about to recognize him. I would just say to my friend, no one ever said this was the answer to the subprime crisis. The answer to the subprime crisis was the subprime bill that we passed. That is what we thought was the answer to that. This was never meant to be the answer to that. The gentleman may have forgotten that we did pass the subprime bill. The gentleman from North Carolina. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. There is a division in the existing law between safety and soundness regulation and consumer protection regulation. Chairwoman Bair said that you had testified or that you had commented as part of the public comment period when the Fed adopted rules that applied to institutions for which you all have principal safety and soundness responsibility--and actually, Comptroller Dugan, you did as well--you commented not for stronger rules, but for weaker rules. You opposed in the public comments many parts of the credit card regulation. Mr. Dugan, I understand that you don't have rulemaking authority. You didn't have rulemaking authority. You do have the authority to bring enforcement actions. The great, great bulk of credit card business was with national banks. It is now like the top 3 banks have 75 percent of the business. It was a little bit less sometime back, but it has always been dominated by national banks. And there were no enforcement actions. Now-- yes, sir? Am I missing something?"
"Mr. Dugan","Yes. First, you are missing something. We brought a number of enforcement actions against credit card banks, particularly the subprime credit card lenders, where we brought so many enforcement actions against them that they stopped doing business as national banks. Second, we enforced the rules that applied to credit card companies. The rules that you are talking about, the suggestions and the practices that caused Congress to pass a statute that applies to them, we will enforce those, too. But we can't make up rules. In fact, we are prohibited from adopting anything that looks like a rule if it is given to another agency by statute. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Well, the statute now is that you can enforce the Federal Trade Commission's unfair and deceptive trade practices--acts and practices rule, and you can do that by enforcement action."
"Mr. Dugan","But we can't write a rule under that. Only the Federal Reserve can. We have requested that authority. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. You can bring enforcement actions with respect to specific practices as a violation of the--"
"Mr. Dugan","We do. And we have brought 11 of them in the last 9 years against significant companies, and we have issued guidances related to it, but we can't define them as a matter--"
"The Chairman","Just to clarify, that was 11 in 9 years?"
"Mr. Dugan","Those kind of specific enforcement actions. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. That is more than I thought you had brought. But did you bring any enforcement actions with respect to charging the double-cycle billing, for charging interest on a balance that had already been paid off?"
"Mr. Dugan","Double-cycle billing was expressly permitted by regulation, by the Federal Reserve. There is no way we could have brought an action against them as an unfair and deceptive practice that the regulation permitted. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. Raising the interest rates on an existing balance. That was expressly allowed?"
"Mr. Dugan","If it is adequately disclosed to consumers that can happen to their balances when they do something, it is not an unfair and deceptive practice to raise it. It is now unlawful to do that because Congress acted. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Right."
"Mr. Dugan","But that rule was not in place. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. You have said on several occasions that there were a great many practices that you simply stopped banks from doing by dissuading them from doing it as part of your supervision."
"Mr. Dugan","Right. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Given what has gone on in the economy in this decade, can you give us some idea of the kinds of things you have talked them out of doing? Given what happened and what was allowed, what did you talk them out of? Was it human trafficking? Conflict minerals? What did you talk them out of?"
"Mr. Dugan","Okay. I will give you a couple of examples, and then I will also say that a bunch of the practices, the very worst subprime mortgage lending, was not occurring inside national banks or State banks for that matter. It was in unregulated State entities where the States were in charge of them. And the numbers show that. In terms of the things that we have leaned on people, payday lending was something where the payday lenders tried to get ahold of national banking franchises to run payday lending operations in them, and we stopped it. We stopped them from so- called renting the national bank charter to do that. I mentioned subprime lending and credit cards, where we saw a number of abuses that caused real problems. Both on the consumer protection side and the safety and soundness side, we came down very hard on it, and we essentially ended that practice for the monoline stand-alone subprime lenders in the credit card business. I can provide you other examples and specific cases and would be happy to do that for the record. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. My time is nearly up."
"The Chairman","I will take the last 20 seconds to say, I would note, Mr. Dugan, you mentioned the failure to do the subprime regulation in the nonbanks. The authority to do that was lodged in one those safety and soundness regulators whose autonomy you are protecting, the Federal Reserve. Your proposal would keep that in the Federal Reserve, your position. Because the Federal Reserve has made your consumer protections, and you have said leave them with the safety and soundness regulator. The fact is, as Mr. Miller also pointed out, you said, well, we couldn't do that; the Federal Reserve gave them the permission to do it. So the consequence of what you are saying, don't give any enforcement powers to this, the Federal Reserve refused to use the enforcement powers, and you are for the status quo with the Federal Reserve."
"Mr. Dugan","That is not what I am saying. What I was saying was--"
"The Chairman","Excuse me, Mr. Dugan, it is when you say that we should not create a consumer agency--"
"Mr. Dugan","I didn't say that."
"The Chairman","--and give it enforcement powers. You did say that. You said we shouldn't give the consumer agency the enforcement and examination powers. They should be left with the safety and soundness regulator. That includes the Federal Reserve, whose inaction you have frequently cited."
"Mr. Dugan","I am sorry if I created a misunderstanding. What I was trying to say was we should give the new CFPA rule- writing power--"
"The Chairman","And not examination and enforcement."
"Mr. Dugan","--and examination enforcement with respect to nonbanks."
"The Chairman","Right. But not with respect to banks, which is where the credit card issue came in. You cited an example of the credit card situation where you were in fact debarred from taking action, when Mr. Miller asked you, because the Federal Reserve, a safety and soundness bank regulator, explicitly allowed the banks to do it. And according to your position, that status quo would continue."
"Mr. Dugan","No, because I think the new CFPA would write the rules, would have that issue--"
"The Chairman","But there were rules that were written that the Fed wouldn't use. Do you think the Federal Reserve has done a good job in consumer protection?"
"Mr. Dugan","No, what I am saying is that 75 percent of those credit card companies are regulated by national banks, 25 percent--"
"The Chairman","And the regulations allow them to do all those things. The hearing will now recess. We will return after the votes. "
"Mr. Kanjorski","The committee will be in order. Mr. Scott of Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me ask, it is a great pleasure to have the three of you here, who are our primary regulators in our system. But I would like to take the gist of my questions on the state of the economy now. Because in the final analysis, a major reason why we are putting these financial reforms in place is to, quite honestly, save our economy and our financial system. But if I am the American people out watching us and trying to glean something from what is a very complex, complicated issue, our report card for the American people would get an ``F'' right now. And I want to ask you, Ms. Bair, Comptroller Dugan, Mr. Bowman, and also you, Mr. Smith, why are we at the state that we are after spending $700 billion in TARP money, $700 billion in bailout money, $700 billion in economic recovery? We are looking at almost $2 trillion that we directly put out within the last 7 or 8 months, and yet, as you and I have discussed, Ms. Bair, and I would like for you to lead off, because the indicators are not very good for us. Home foreclosures are still ratcheting through the roof. Bank closings are at a record rate, especially in my home State of Georgia. Unemployment is at 10 percent, and in some areas at Depression levels. Banks that we are supervising and you are regulators of are not lending, particularly to small businesses, therefore bringing out bankruptcies there. So to me, the American people are probably saying, what good does it do for us to be sitting up dealing with these regulatory reforms when, in fact, where is the report on what we have been doing? Why is it that we can't see the jobless numbers go down? Why is it that banks are not moving to mitigate loans? Why is it that banks are not restructuring? And at the same time that this is happening, many of them are going back to their same old ways of bonuses and salaries. The American people have a right to be very angry. So could you please respond to why we are in the state we are in? And what are we doing to get these banks to unleash this money and make loans and mitigate loans so that people can--we can really stimulate the economy and keep people in their homes? I think if we do that, that is the way in which we are going to stop all of these bank foreclosures and small businesses going into bankruptcy. And Ms. Bair, I would particularly like for you, because we moved to give the FDIC the authority and funding to move within the foreclosure area particularly to deal with this area, could you really tell us how we are progressing there, and why we are not doing more?"
"Ms. Bair","Well, a couple of things. Regarding loan modifications, that is something certainly we advocated. And some of the work we did with the IndyMac loan modification program was used by Treasury and HUD to launch their own HAMP program. This is not something we are doing, though we support it and have tried to provide technical assistance. They estimate they can get about 500,000 loans modified in the near future. It is making a dent, but it was never meant to be the complete cure. It is not, but it can help a significant number of folks stay in their homes. To get banks to lend, we have taken a number of steps. We are asking our examiners to do a lot. There was some bad lending going on. There was some lending based on rising collateral values that shouldn't have happened. So, because there was too much credit out there, there needed to be some type of pull back. But the challenge is to make sure it doesn't pull back so far that the credit-worthy loans, the prudent loans, are not being made. We have tried to strike this balance with our examiners. We want our banks to lend. We want prudent lending. But, we don't want them to overreact. There are a lot of cross-currents. There are a lot of people saying that regulation wasn't tough enough; we need to be tougher. And there are other people saying, you are being too tough. It is a hard balance to strike. We have tried to provide clarity in a number of key areas. We have said very specifically that we want commercial loans restructured also. We want small business loans restructured, too. Loss mitigation is a good business practice, whether it is for residential mortgages or commercial mortgages. That needs to be disclosed and done properly. We want the appropriate loans restructured. We don't want good loans written down just because the collateral value has fallen. We don't want that to happen. We have made that very clear."
"Mr. Scott","I know my time is running out. It is about to run out, too. But I did want to get to, why are so many banks closing, especially in the State of Georgia? What is there? Is there something we can point to that is going on in Georgia to explain why so many of these banks are closing?"
"Ms. Bair","There are a lot of banks in Georgia. It was a boom area. Now, many of the boom areas are bust areas. There is residential mortgage distress and a lot of commercial real estate distress as well. In Georgia, like other parts of the country, it is broader economic problems that are feeding losses on bank balance sheets, which is driving closures as well. One of the best things you can do for the banking system, especially community banks, is to get the economy going again quickly, keep the unemployment rate down, get those retailers back in business, and get those hotels full again. Those are the kinds of things that will help banks as well. In Georgia, bank closures were a symptom of a lot of banks existing in the State, plus it was a great boom area. And as in other areas, like Florida, southern California, and Nevada, Georgia is having a severe bust now."
"Mr. Scott","I would just like to ask unanimous consent just for 30 more seconds. Is that possible?"
"Mr. Kanjorski","The price is you are going to assume the Chair right after your next question."
"Mr. Scott","Okay. I will be willing to pay that price. Thank you. Mr. Dugan, I wanted to go to one specific thing. You and I have discussed this, I believe, in my office. And I wanted to know, have we made any progress? Because I think there is so much more our banks can do that they are not doing in terms of lending. But there is a practice that is going on within the banking system that I think that we do need to address. I spoke to you about that, and I wanted to know if we have moved on that. And that is this, that we have been receiving some complaints from some of our constituency that when they have multiple services at these banks where one will have their savings account, their checking account, and then they will go borrow maybe a home equity loan, and then--or another loan, but without any acquiescence to the customer, the bank has the right, apparently, which I think is wrong, to without any--with total disregard to the customer, to go into one of the other accounts, get money out of that account to pay for something in the other account. It puts that customer and that consumer at a very disadvantage without having a notification, without knowing. He may think he has so much money there, but the bank has already gone in and got it to pay something else, maybe the home equity loan. And I was wondering, I know you were concerned about that, and I wanted to find out if you moved on that and what we need to do to stop that."
"Mr. Dugan","I am not sure that we have seen that as a rampant problem in the system. There are some rights related to set off when you have some issues, but I don't believe that banks can routinely use one account to pay the debts of another bank. But I will get back to you on that, on where we are on that, if I could, for the record. Let me just also say that earlier this week, I did spend some time with Georgia community national bankers in Atlanta, and would just echo all of the comments that my colleague just said about the situation in Georgia and some of the issues that they have."
"Mr. Scott","All right. I just want to say, we need your help in Georgia. And we want to stop this trend of banks foreclosing and a lot of the other things that are going. So I appreciate your attention on these two matters. Thank you."
"Mr. Bachus","Mr. Chairman, one thing, I hope you will allow some of the people on the other side some liberal time, by which I mean I am not protesting the additional time, but I would allow that courtesy to be extended on--"
"Mr. Kanjorski","If it is Mrs. Biggert, we are going to allow her 18 minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you."
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentlelady from Illinois, Mrs. Biggert, is recognized."
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am not one of many words. That is why you said that. Chairman Bair, I have had some of my community bankers come in to see me, and they have some real concerns, particularly with where they have been required to reserve 3 percent of all of their fully performing construction loans and land development loans. And so that has significantly impaired their CPA capital ratio so that they have been rated barely adequately capitalized. And then, in turn, they were told, well, now you can't get any TARP money or to withdraw their application because of the just barely adequately capitalized. And they are concerned that if they had gotten TARP funds, they would be well capitalized and not in danger of becoming undercapitalized. And the other issue that they worry about is there might be these special assessments that they would have from the FDIC. What should I tell them to do?"
"Ms. Bair","We understand the additional stress that another special assessment would create. So we are actively considering other options. The FDIC Board will be meeting next week and will be voting on some options for public comment. We very much understand the stress that another special assessment could place on smaller institutions. We are looking at this issue very carefully and evaluating other options as well. On the TARP, obviously the TARP is not an FDIC program. There is an interagency process where the primary regulator will make an initial set of recommendations to an interagency group, and then make recommendations to the Treasury Department. The standard remains viability without the funding. This is a difficult determination to make. If that test is not passed--if there is a question about that--then it is a very difficult judgment to make. We have suggested a matching program so that banks can show a strength in their ability to raise nongovernment money on at least a dollar-for-dollar basis. That might be another way to build some flexibilities into the program. I can't respond to the 3 percent reserving requirement. I am unaware that we have a carte blanche rule like that. I can check that and get back to you. The general rule is, if it is a performing loan and if the borrower has the documented capacity to continue making the loan--has the income, the balance sheet to support continued payments--then generally it should not be classified. I can talk with our staff, and if there is a specific instance you would like to bring to our attention, I can have our supervisory staff address that."
"Mrs. Biggert","Have you explored the idea of a shared equity loss program and where the FDIC would match private equity and increase capital? In other words, instead of having them go under and then bring in somebody with the 90 percent, would that be a way of--"
"Ms. Bair","Well, we have a statutory prohibition against providing open bank assistance unless there is a systemic risk determination, which is hard to do with the smaller institutions. We have made a systemic risk determination with the Treasury and the Federal Reserve Board to undertake a troubled asset relief program--the PPIF or legacy loan program. We just did a test sale of a legacy loan mechanism with our receivership assets. And we are now looking at how we might use that for open institutions. I think it is a matter of evaluating what the criteria should be for institutions that are viable and have franchise value or would be viable with this additional help and can raise private capital. I think there is a good case to use such a mechanism if they can meet that criteria. However, we do have strong statutory restrictions against providing open bank assistance. And we do not have authority to make a direct capital investment in an open bank."
"Mrs. Biggert","Then just a quick question for several people, but beyond the authority to write and enforce Unfair and Deceptive Practices Act rules and enforce mortgages and credit card rules, did any of you actually write consumer protection rules? And who wrote them? And who currently writes them, the consumer protection rules and regulations?"
"Ms. Bair","As both Comptroller Dugan and I have said, the OCC and the FDIC do not have authority to write UDAP rules. We don't. We have asked. We really have. We can provide our testimony and show you we have asked for that authority."
"Mrs. Biggert","Did you have any say? I guess the answer is the Fed, but--"
"Ms. Bair","The Federal Reserve Board had that rulemaking authority. We filed comment letters with the Federal Reserve Board encouraging them to promulgate rules. We have never had the authority to do that ourselves, to write rules."
"Mrs. Biggert","All right. Thank you. I yield back."
"Mr. Scott","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, is recognized."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Last month, The Wall Street Journal had a rather disturbing article, which I assume you are familiar with. I will quote from it: ``Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner blasted top U.S. financial regulators in an expletive-laced critique last Friday, as frustration grows over the Obama administration's faltering plan to overhaul U.S. financial regulation, according to people familiar with the meeting. ``Mr. Geithner told the regulators Friday that `enough is enough,' said one person familiar with the meeting. Mr. Geithner said regulators had been given a chance to air their concerns, but that it was time to stop, this person said. Friday's roughly hour-long meeting was described as unusual not only because of Mr. Geithner's repeated use of obscenities but because of the aggressive posture he took with officials from Federal agencies generally considered independent of the White House.'' The article asserts that at least three of the four of you were in attendance at that meeting. Assuming that to be true for our first three panelists, is The Wall Street Journal story accurate? I will start with you, Chairman Bair."
"Ms. Bair","Congressman, I don't like to comment, I am sorry, on private meetings. I will tell you, though, that any input we provided to Congress has been independent. I used to work for Congress. I understand being an independent agency. When you ask for my views, I am going to give them to you. And I also am giving you my views based upon what I think are the best mechanisms to put in place from a regulatory reform standpoint and a consumer protection standpoint."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you. Comptroller Dugan?"
"Mr. Dugan","I would agree with that. I would say there was a candid exchange of views, and it hasn't in any way affected my job and my duty as Comptroller to call these issues as I see them and be fully independent, as Congress has expressly provided with respect to my agency and the other agencies up here."
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Bowman?"
"Mr. Bowman","I would agree with both of those statements. And I really think that our opinions of our respective independence from the White House and/or the Treasury, can be found in our respective testimonies both here and in the Senate. And I think that really does speak for our position on where we go and how independent we are."
"Mr. Hensarling","I thank you. Clearly, I didn't hear it was inaccurate, but I respect that you wish to keep it confidential. I understand that. But I do think it is important that this committee hear your commitment to independence. Your opinion, and I have disagreed with your opinions on many occasions, and I assume that on future occasions, I will disagree again. But it is a terribly important opinion. It is a terribly relevant opinion. And this committee needs to know it is an independent opinion. And I am not quite sure how one proves a negative, but with articles like this, you can understand a number of us on the committee remain concerned. Perhaps this will be a bit simpler question to answer. The CFPA, as presently constituted in the Administration's White Paper and in Chairman Frank's bill--and I know we have this memo floating around ostensibly from Chairman Frank to members of his committee. I haven't heard the chairman either verify or deny the accuracy of that memo. So, theoretically, the bill may change. But again, I don't know the accuracy of this memo. My question is this: The CFPA as presently constituted, in your professional opinion, could it or would it lead to less credit and more costly credit for families and small businesses in our economy? Again, I suppose going left to right to make it easy, Chairman Bair? Apparently, it wasn't that easy of a question."
"Ms. Bair","With so many of these issues, it depends on who is the head of the agency and how it is structured, and I think that the structure is in flux: Chairman Frank's observation about placing the focus prohibiting bad practices as opposed to identifying and enforcing good practices may help address that concern."
"Mr. Hensarling","So is it fair to say, potentially yes, but you don't know?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Comptroller Dugan, do you have an opinion on the matter?"
"Mr. Dugan","I think part and parcel of it is this repeal of uniform standards for national banks and for Federal thrifts. And as I testified or mentioned earlier, I do think that could lead to the kind of increased costs that could in turn increase potential litigation exposure, that could in turn result in increased costs to consumers of financial products, but also restricted availability of products and services."
"Mr. Hensarling","So, as presently written, your answer would be yes. Is that a fair assessment?"
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, with the preemption piece in it, yes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Bowman?"
"Mr. Bowman","I agree with both of the responses. It could result in additional costs and a reduction in credit. But we will see what it looks like at the end of the process."
"Mr. Hensarling","Just so you don't get lonely, Commissioner Smith, we will let you answer the question as well."
"Mr. Smith","I will give you the best answer, which is that, when we adopted State legislation to address predatory lending, we were called reverse redliners. It was said we were reducing credit availability at the time we did it. And I wish we had reduced it sooner, because what happened was the result of the loans that were made during the period I am talking about, which was 2005 to 2007, let's say, was that millions of families went out of their homes. So the answer to the question may well be, yes, there would be less credit. The question really is whether that is a bad thing or not."
"Mr. Scott","The gentleman's time has expired. I recognize the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a couple of questions. My primary concern in this regulatory reform is the whole issue really of not so much ``too-big-to-fail,'' but ``too-interconnected-to-fail.'' I am not sure that they are not synonymous. And I am not sure how that is being dealt with. But that is another issue for another committee hearing, I think. It may be important for me to focus on the issue of whether we need a regulator, which is why I think you are here. Do any of you know who Dennis Blair is? He is the Director of National Intelligence. And the reason that he is there is because, after 9/11, we discovered, to our dismay and to our great pain and embarrassment, that we had agencies not communicating with one another. We had the FBI and the CIA, both having intelligence on the 9/11 terrorists, and they were not sharing. And so, in an attempt to correct a problem, we now have a Director of National Intelligence who is the cop, so we don't have those problems again. Any time we have a crisis and we can identify a problem, don't all of you agree, do all of you agree that then we need to make some adjustments? Who believes that we should not make an adjustment?"
"Ms. Bair","We all support reform very vigorously. Absolutely."
"Mr. Dugan","We agree with that. And even though I would say that, in a crisis, it brings regulators more together to have to share than--"
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes, but the question, Mr. Dugan, is what brings them together, the crisis and the declaration that we should come together?"
"Mr. Dugan","I would say, first of all, we have to work together on a bunch of things because we have to put out common rules on things. And John Bowman and I are both on the FDIC Board. We vote on things like the assessment that we were talking about earlier. So we inevitably have a lot of interaction with each other, unlike some other regulatory agencies. And I think the caldron and the crucible of a crisis brings you even more together. But I think it is also true that this crisis has identified issues that need to be addressed through changes in the regulatory framework and structure, which I think we all support."
"Mr. Cleaver","Okay. So how do you think the average U.S. citizen will respond if the chairman of the committee hits the gavel and says, okay, everybody has learned how to function better, we are not going to have any reform in spite of the fact that the world economy almost ran off a cliff? How many of you think that the American citizens are going to say, oh, that is good?"
"Ms. Bair","No one, sir."
"Mr. Dugan","No one, sir."
"Mr. Cleaver","So we need to do something, you would agree. Who would independently move? We have 3 banks controlling 75 percent of the credit card debt in this country. There is something wrong with that. Do you agree? More than 75 percent of the credit card debt held by 3 companies?"
"Mr. Dugan","It is more than 3, because the banks that we supervise, national banks, have about 75 percent depending upon how you count it, and it is more than 3 banks."
"Mr. Cleaver","So Wells, Bank of America, and J.P. Morgan. Who else?"
"Mr. Dugan","Actually, Citi is bigger into credit cards than Wells is. And then U.S. Bank is, and then you have American Express and Discover. It is dominated by a smaller group of providers than other financial services. That is definitely the case. But it is a business of scale. And because it demands such an investment in systems and products, it naturally leads to larger providers. I think you have to watch that in terms of any time you have a smaller number of people providing the same product, you get into questions over time of whether it raises competition questions. But there are certain products that lend themselves to having more or fewer providers in it."
"Mr. Cleaver","One final question: Was it 9 cases in 11 years or 11 cases in 9 years?"
"Mr. Dugan","The latter. Under UDAP. That is right."
"Mr. Cleaver","Is that good or bad?"
"Mr. Dugan","I would say two things. Number one, first of all, we are supervisors. We see these institutions every day. And we get a lot of things done before you ever get to the question of a formal enforcement action. We do it through our normal supervision. We do it through matters requiring attention. We do it through informal actions. And that is the advantage of having supervisors in there. They can get corrective action taken right away when they see things before they turn into enforcement kinds of problems, number one. Number two, as we talked about earlier, some of the practices that people complained about were not illegal. And we couldn't make them illegal because we didn't have the power to write rules with respect to them."
"Mr. Scott","The gentleman's time has expired. Now we will recognize the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Price."
"Mr. Price","Thank you, Mr. Scott. I appreciate that. I want to thank you all for your patience. My friend from Missouri says we have to do something. We have to do something. Is it possible do the wrong thing? Is that possible? Everybody agrees."
"Mr. Dugan","Yes."
"Mr. Price","We can do the wrong thing."
"Mr. Dugan","Right."
"Mr. Price","So the goal of this committee obviously ought to be to do the right thing, and not just do anything at all or something. And I think we need to remember that as we try to devise a system that is more responsive and works better for people as opposed to the one we currently have and also the one we might be reinforcing with some current rules. Mr. Dugan and Mr. Bowman, I want to talk a little bit about, please, the new recent guidance that the OCC and the OTS have put forward, the ban on no-interest/no-payment activity promotions that are done oftentimes by retailers. Some retailers say that their no-interest/no-payment for a period of time comprises a significant portion of their business, sometimes up to 20 percent. The repayment on those is in many instances very, very high. It works well. It works well for people, and it works well for the retailers. Why would you do that?"
"Mr. Dugan","We have something called our account management guidance that applies to all credit card providers. We were seeing some real problems in our portfolio about people not making consumers even pay a very small amount due. This was masking losses over time that they were continuing to report as income. It was a truly unsafe and unsound practice, and it was also resulting in consumers getting deeper and deeper into debt."
"Mr. Price","So the information that I have from retailers that they have a payment rate of over 90 percent, or approaching 90 percent on no-interest/no-payment credit for a period of time, is that not accurate?"
"Mr. Dugan","Well, I have seen the letter that they provided, and we will respond to the particulars of the letter. And I would be happy to do that. I think the particular point we would make is we are treating them exactly the same way we treat other credit card providers."
"Mr. Price","That is my concern."
"Mr. Dugan","We are trying to get indications that the customer can repay the loans. We are not saying that they can't do no-interest. But they have to make some regular payments, repayments to demonstrate the capacity and ability to repay to address safety and soundness."
"Mr. Price","This one-size-fits-all notion tends to result in decreased flexibility and decreased responsiveness to the consumer. And Washington can run the whole show, there is no doubt about it. But it may result in a system that is not as helpful for the American people."
"Mr. Bowman?",""
"Mr. Bowman","I wouldn't add anything more to what Mr. Dugan has said. The attempt is to ensure, first of all, that the consumer appreciates the obligation to repay. Ninety percent of them do, according to the letter that we received. The goal is to keep the examiners mindful of the particular product, the consumer and the institution mindful of what it is they have and the ability to ensure that repayments are provided for."
"Mr. Price","So you both are telling me then that it is possible that this ban isn't an absolute ban?"
"Mr. Dugan","What I would like to do is respond in detail to each of the items in the letter. And I think that can give some color to it."
"Mr. Price","Great. I look forward to that. Chairman Bair, as my friend from Georgia said, we are having awful, awful problems down there. And I am not convinced that the FDIC isn't contributing to the awful problems that we are having. In many instances, the banks that I have talked to that the FDIC has come in and taken over, the consequences of that are real. There are real-life consequences to the people in those communities. Some of these small community banks where they have performing assets, performing loans, they have been asked by the--they have been demanded by the FDIC to increase their capitalization. And they do so. And still they dot every ``i'' and they cross every ``t,'' and then the knock comes on the door on Friday afternoon. The consequences to these decisions that the FDIC takes are massive, and they are not necessarily favorable to the community and to the individuals in those communities. We have had this conversation before. And we have been assured of flexibility and responsibleness and reasonableness by the FDIC personnel. I understand it is a tough job. But we are killing communities. We are killing communities with action that, from many individuals' perspectives, doesn't need to be taken."
"Ms. Bair","The process close a bank is made by the chartering authority. So, for a State bank, it is made by the State bank supervisor. For a federally-chartered institution, it is the OTS or the OCC. There is a dialogue, obviously, with the FDIC, in alerting us to the possibility that a bank could fail, in preparing for the closure and monitoring the resolution process. But, the resolution process is governed by a strict statutory regimen of Prompt Corrective Action. This was an outgrowth of the savings and loan crisis where Congress rightfully felt that there had been too much forbearance. And it is true that once an institution becomes nonviable, the longer you wait for it to be closed and resolved, the higher the costs will be, because it will continue to lose money. Such institutions are not doing much healthy lending anymore, and will continue to lose franchise value. We take this very seriously. I am painfully aware of the concerns and the drama surrounding the closure of an institution. But in these instances, this needed to be done. We make every effort to market and sell the bank in advance of the resolution. And usually for a community bank, we have been successful in selling it to another community bank, another bank servicing that area which is healthier and is in a better position to provide credit services and deposit services to the community. We can't always do that. In most cases, we have been successful."
"Mr. Price","The problem with that is oftentimes those individuals who come in know nothing about the community. There are no relationships. And in the process of doing that--and again people who have dotted every ``i'' and crossed every ``t,'' jumped through all the hoops and thought they were moving in the right direction based upon the FDIC, then they are removed, and folks who come in are from somewhere else, and the local community is without a local lender."
"Ms. Bair","We try to avoid that. We absolutely try to avoid that. If there are specific resolutions which you would like to talk about later, I would be happy to do that. But if an institution has insufficient capital and it cannot raise new capital, there is not much we can do about it."
"Mr. Price","That is not the case. I appreciate that, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Scott","Chairman Bair, and just before I get to Mr. Green, as we both pointed out, we both represent Georgia. There is a particular problem with Georgia. And some of us feel very strongly, as the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Price, has said that there is more that the FDIC can do to help us in Georgia. And there are things that they might not be doing that are helping to cause the problem in Georgia. There are just too many banks closing in the State of Georgia, and we want to put a stop to that. I would appreciate it, and I am sure the people of Georgia would appreciate it very much if the FDIC could review how they are dealing with the banks in Georgia to work with a plan to see if we can't stop this very terrible pattern. Because it is just not fair nor right. Thank you. Thank you for that. I wanted to get that out. I now recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Green","Thank you. Mr. Price, did you get your concern addressed? Because I see that the two of you are very much concerned about this. Would you need an additional 30 seconds? You are good? Okay. Thank you. Let me thank all of you for appearing today. And I would like to first mention to you that ``too-big-to-fail'' in my world is the right size to regulate. Not only is it the right size to regulate, but as you approach becoming ``too-big-to- fail,'' I think you are the right size to regulate. I absolutely think that we must find a way to avoid another AIG. I cannot imagine doing nothing and allowing circumstances to manifest themselves again such that we will have another AIG. It would be unconscionable for us to do nothing. And it would be unconscionable for us to, under the guise of doing something, do nothing. It would be unconscionable for us to allow the paralysis of analysis to prevent us from doing anything. We do have to act. And I think that when Mr. Cleaver, in his defense, talked about doing something, I would hope that it would be presumed that he was talking about doing the right thing, as it has been said. I rarely find him suggesting that we do the wrong thing, in his defense. So having said this, let me just ask a few questions to see if we can agree on some things that are floating around that are not necessarily entirely true. CRA: Did the CRA cause the economic crisis that we are having to contend with? Chairwoman--by the way, I would have had Chairwoman, not Chairman, but if you--"
"Ms. Bair","Just not ``Chair Bair.'' I don't like that."
"Mr. Green","Did it cause the crisis?"
"Ms. Bair","No, it did not. No."
"Mr. Green","Comptroller?"
"Mr. Dugan","No, it did not."
"Mr. Green","Acting director?"
"Mr. Bowman","No, it did not."
"Mr. Green","Commissioner?"
"Mr. Smith","Absolutely did not."
"Mr. Green","Did not. The CRA did not cause the current crisis. And I would hope that would echo through the halls of Congress such that at least we can put that to rest. Did overregulation of the market create the problem that we are trying to contend with, an overregulated market? In words that may not be suitable, but did a lack--did laissez-faire, the lack of laissez-faire create the problem? Chairwoman Bair?"
"Ms. Bair","No, a lack of laissez-faire did not cause the problem, no."
"Mr. Dugan","I agree."
"Mr. Bowman","I agree."
"Mr. Smith","I have already testified that I don't think that is the case."
"Mr. Green","Okay. I just want to build this record, because we continually hear that it was an overregulated market that created the circumstance. We continually hear that it was the CRA that created the circumstance. And at some point, people who are involved, engaged, and who study these things, their opinions ought to count for something. Notwithstanding your opinions, by the way, my belief is that we have entered an era of time where there is no indisputable truth. We will find some person in some distant corner of the world who differs with you, and we will find a way to give this person credibility such that this person will carry as much weight as all of you who study these things quite regularly. And I consider you experts to some degree. Moving along, with reference to a Consumer Financial Protection Agency, whether we bifurcate or consolidate, leaving that aside, bifurcation, the question of bifurcation, should we have a consumer protection agency? Because, and I ask this because, quite frankly, there are some who contend that there is no need for a consumer protection agency, that things will work themselves out if we just allow time to pass, as opposed to do something with the passage of time. Chairwoman Bair, do we need a consumer protection agency?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes, I think we do."
"Mr. Green","Comptroller?"
"Mr. Dugan","To go back and touch on your earlier question, there was a rule-writing gap, and there was an implementation gap so that different firms were treated differently with respect to consumer protection. And I think a CFPA is a way to get at that."
"Mr. Green","I take it from this you would say yes, but I understand that there may be--we all have different opinions about how it should come into being. But are we at a point where we can say we need to do this? Acting Director, please, sir?"
"Mr. Bowman","The answer is yes."
"Mr. Green","And Mr. Commissioner?"
"Mr. Smith","Yes. But I think, in fairness to myself and my colleagues at the table here, that each of us has reservations about the current proposal."
"Mr. Green","I understand. That is why I took bifurcation and consolidation off of the board. My time is up, but as I leave you, I just want to say this: We are charged with the responsibility of, in some sense, being the watchdog for the public. We have a duty to act positively, to try to avoid unintended consequences. But if we don't act, our inaction will become our action. And that inaction is going to create another circumstance that we will have to cope with in the future. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much."
"Mr. Royce",""
"Mr. Royce","Thank you. Let me ask a quick question. This has to do with something that I remember the Federal Reserve bringing to us in, I think it was about 2004, where they laid out a concern they had with the Government-Sponsored Enterprises. And their worry was that, unless they could regulate for systemic risk and have the ability to reduce the portfolios some, they were worried that with a $1.5 trillion portfolio, and a mandate that we had built up over the years that half of it had to be subprime and Alt-A loans and so forth, that it was leveraged 100 to 1, and so they were saying, we could have a systemic risk problem if we don't have sufficient regulation to allow us to address this. Do you think that could have been a contributor to the problem in terms of what happened in the GSEs? If I could ask the panel?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes, I think the GSEs did contribute to the problem."
"Mr. Dugan","I would agree that was a contributing factor."
"Mr. Bowman","Agreed."
"Mr. Smith","Agreed."
"Mr. Royce","And I guess that comes around to one of the problems with the CRA, because under the CRA, there was leverage in order to get to that goal. Those who were pushing the CRA saw a certain advantage in terms of having that subprime portfolio held by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. But in any event, let me go down a line of questions, because with distance comes some perspective on some of these issues. And I wanted to quote from something Ms. Bair said. She said we need to develop a resolution regime that provides for the orderly wind down of large, systemically-important financial firms without imposing large costs to the taxpayers. In contrast to the current situation, this new regime would not focus on propping up the current firm and its management. Now, if we take Treasury Secretary Geithner's reform proposal, it reads, and it comes from a different direction it seems to me, it says the regime also should provide for the ability to stabilize a failing institution by providing loans to the firm, purchasing assets from the firm, guaranteeing the liabilities of the firm, or making equity investments in the firm. And this sounds like you and the Secretary have different ideas on the options that should be available to regulators when it comes to resolving a failed institution. So I would ask if you believe what the Treasury Secretary is suggesting amounts to granting permanent bailout authority, or is there a distinction that I am missing? Because as I read it, it suggests, or he suggests that we grant authority to prop up failed institutions, as we have in recent months, without necessarily moving them through an unwinding process. And here is why I think it is important. I think if there is any ambiguity as to what would happen should an institution run into trouble, then the market is going to view that institution as government-backed, as was the case with Fannie and Freddie. And if that is the perception by the market, then you are going to have a moral hazard problem. And that is why I feel that is something we should avoid going forward. And I was going to ask you, Ms. Bair, about my concern about that."
"Ms. Bair","I agree with you. It needs to be quite clear that shareholders and creditors will take losses if these big firms become nonviable and have to be closed. It should be a wind down, not a conservatorship or Government-run enterprise. It needs to be quite clear what will happen. You will not get market discipline back until this is clear. Recent measures have exacerbated the problem. Some people joke now we have more GSEs because of these. We are part of these programs, and we support these programs, but we didn't really have an option. But going forward we should have a resolution mechanism in place that works for large, interconnected financial institutions that allows them to be closed. It is very important to be able to tell the public: no more AIGs. It just shouldn't happen."
"Mr. Royce","I appreciate that. Now, my last question I would like to ask the panel about the costs associated with the Consumer Financial Protection Agency if we do not do that under the existing safety and soundness regulators, if we go out and set up a separate agency, a bifurcated agency. Who ultimately will bear the costs of creating and funding this agency? I don't think it is hard to imagine that the costs would be passed on by the institutions in a competitive market that those costs would end up going onto the customers. So you increase operating and compliance costs and you increase the eventual costs to the consumer. So it seems to me more logical that you would handle that within the--under the safety and soundness regulator, because you would also have the sharing of expertise that regulator has. And so I was going to ask that question."
"Mr. Dugan","As you said, we do have a regime already in place. We already examine people, we already have a system for doing it, and we do combine our supervision for consumer protection and safety and soundness. It is more efficient and will be less costly to get the same level of coverage than it would be to have a whole separate agency. Now, in terms of who gets assessed for it, it was not entirely clear how that would work in the Administration's proposal. And there are other proposals to have the Federal Reserve pay for some of it. So I don't know how that is all going to shake out. But in terms of the costs to consumers, I think they would be higher."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Green","Mr. Klein is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Klein","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you all for your service. Tough responsibilities right now, but we appreciate you taking this on and sticking with it. I would like to just approach this in a before, you know, before all this occurred and what brought us up to this point, and then currently, what are we doing, and then going forward? Just the before, very simply, back home where I am from, and I think around the country, people are upset. They are anxious. They are frustrated. They know a lot of money went out, and they don't see it translating into bank loans to them, or frustrated in dealing with lending capacity. And I think that--I want to spend a minute on that. The current, of course, relates to, what do we do right now? What can we do to get the economy going? And we all understand it is about liquidity. If we think about the RTC a number of years ago, ultimately we got through that because there was access to capital. And whether a building was worth $1 million and sold for $500,000, there was a market, at some free enterprise point buyer and seller, and they came through that. On a going forward basis, a lot of discussion today, and we do appreciate your recommendations on what is being proposed. Chairman Frank has a number of suggestions which I think are worth considering, but we will have those continuing discussions over the next few weeks. But what I want to focus on for a few minutes is just an echo of what you have heard all day today. And that is--I am from Florida. Ms. Bair, you have heard my comments before on this, and I appreciate the opportunity to state it again. That is the access to capital, the strictness and the rigidity, if you will, the inflexibility of banks dealing with existing loans, and defaults based on covenants. I had somebody come in my office today, he even said I could use his name, Wayne Cotton from Design Flooring Distributors in Fort Lauderdale. He had a little over $1 million line of credit, steady as you go, for all these years. He is a leader in the community on a lot of levels. He has buildings to back up and everything else. And because his receivables are down and he is in the building business, if you will, he does interior work, the bank said, we are calling the loan. He got a letter. It said, pay up. Here is the date you have to pay up, and that is it. It is one of our major banks, a bank that took TARP money. And he is as frustrated as all get out, as you can only imagine. And to me, the question is this. Why is it that some of these concepts of borrower capacity, the individual borrower, personal guarantee, whatever it may be, the idea of substitute collateral, being able to put other collateral in place so maybe his receivables and that commitment is down, but maybe the loan can stay in place if there is some type of substitute collateral that can be applied? Why not the principle, and it is not tangible, but the principle of ``time heals?'' Over time, particularly in real estate, some of this will return to some point. We are not getting the banks to consider many of these principles at all. A little bit of sitting down with common sense across the table and saying, all right, you have a problem here, your collateral base is down a little bit, but maybe if you put near piece of real estate in here that has this amount of equity in it, we can still make this work instead of us calling the loan. And there is no ability to refinance, no ability to find another loan. So can you just share with me those two or three principles why is it that can't be integrated or introduced and the examiners consider that or encourage that kind of behavior with the banks? Start out with Ms. Bair, if you don't mind."
"Ms. Bair","We especially encourage our banks to work with their individual borrowers and provide flexibilities. These are individual credit determinations. I don't know the specific circumstances, obviously, but we do encourage banks to work with their borrowers. This is a very difficult judgment, though, for both banks and examiners to be making because we can't let the banks indefinitely defer loss. If the loan has gone bad, a bank should recognize it now, not later. There are those countervailing pressures, and there are critics on the other side as well. It is a very difficult balance. But, we have a very clear policy. We have said this numerous times to our examiners and to our banks. We want them to work with their borrowers--their commercial borrowers, as well as their residential borrowers. Even if they have some credit distress, banks should try to restructure the loan or provide some relief, rather than just foreclosing or cutting off the loan. Where that makes sense from a loss mitigation standpoint, it needs to be appropriately disclosed and reported. But we absolutely encourage them to work with those borrowers and show flexibility."
"Mr. Klein","And I cannot tell you enough how that is not in any meaningful sense translating into the local Florida market--where I am from. I can just speak to my local market in south Florida. It is just not happening enough. And I am seeing a little bit of movement, but we have 90 percent of the way to go. And it is just holding back everything in the economy from small businesses. SBA loans, we waived the fees. Ninety percent--if I was in a bank, I would say, wow, that is a good quality loan. Why aren't banks taking up SBA loans?"
"Ms. Bair","That I don't know. I have been hearing this. I heard this during my trip to Las Vegas. I am actually going to be in Florida in a couple of months, and I am going to be meeting with some bankers. I am hearing that small business lending is absolutely key. It is an area where community banks in particular are the lifeblood for small businesses. This has been raised with me. I am concerned about it. I am going to be looking into it more. I can only tell you what we have done now. We have tried to convey to our banks the need for flexibility and our support for prudent lending. If there is more we can do, we want to."
"Mr. Klein","Mr. Dugan?"
"Mr. Dugan","I would agree with everything Chairman Bair said. I just spent some time with a group of Florida bankers in a meeting earlier this week and heard some of the same issues. We do not tell bankers not to make particular loans. A banker makes a judgment, and I am pretty sure it wouldn't shock you to know that sometimes the regulators get blamed for loans not being made when--"
"Mr. Klein","More from the borrower's side--"
"Mr. Dugan","We are in a deep recession. Florida is a place where there has been a lot of trouble with commercial real estate. I think there has been a risk-preferring posture that has gone to risk-avoiding, and that is partly due to the economy and to where people are as much as it is due to examination policies. But I quite agree that if the borrower can show ways that they can repay the loan, then that is something we encourage our people to work with. But I do have to caution you that time does not always make things better; sometimes time makes things worse. And we get, as Chairman Bair said, quite criticized, and our resolution costs go up. Our Inspectors General fault us for not acting swiftly enough. You mentioned the RTC; that was all after-the-fact, postclosure stuff, where all that stuff ran through it. So it is a complicated balance. We strive hard to do it. We hear you. We will keep at it."
"Ms. Waters","Mr. Bachus."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. One thing that we have not--I don't think has come up is the effect of the unregulated subprime affiliates of depository institutions, and I know, Comptroller Dugan, you--at one time, the OCC issued a list of how many of the subprime lenders that failed actually were not regulated by either Federal or State regulators. Would you like to comment on that and the effect that has?"
"Mr. Dugan","I don't think there is any serious question that the overwhelming proportion of subprime loans that have caused the worst problems, the highest foreclosure rates were in nonbanks; that is, entities that were not regulated by banking regulators. And we have data, and we--"
"Mr. Bachus","It was very impressive."
"Mr. Dugan","We will be providing some additional statistics. If you look at the worst foreclosure rates in the worst cities, it was not from the regulated institutions. It is the flip side of people who think that the CRA has caused the problems, which is only done in banks, CRA lending, and the data just does not show it. And it is why we believe having a rulewriter that can write rules that apply the same to banks as well as nonbanks, and why the importance of having new Federal attention being paid to nonbanks to bring their compliance level up to the level of banks is so important. That is the powerful part of the idea behind a CFPA."
"Mr. Bachus","And I am not sure it has to be done through that agency. It could simply be that the existing agencies could take responsibility. But someone ought to be regulating that market. And we have passed registration for mortgage originators. But does anyone else want to comment on that?"
"Mr. Smith","I do think the money for those loans had to come from somewhere. Most of the originators weren't banks themselves, they weren't mortgage lenders themselves, they were funded by somebody, so I am interested in those statistics. I do think the power of the CFPA is exactly what the Comptroller says, which is it will apply to everybody across- the-board in the same way the SAFE Act promises to apply regulation, license your kind of regulation across-the-board as well."
"Mr. Bachus","But if you had underwriting standards, and you said, we are going to regulate underwriting standards, you could--"
"Mr. Smith","Whoever was providing the money--someone provided financing to these alleged unregulated subprime originators."
"Mr. Bachus","I understand that, but I think even banks--and one of the problems was not only were they unregulated subprime lenders, but they were also--the depository institutions purchased them. And it was actually Wachovia who did that, Bank of America, Merrill Lynch. You could go on and on."
"Mr. Smith","Somehow the regulated institutions filled with Ph.D.s and so forth were fooled by the people I did deal with, because I do regulate the mortgage market, many of whom hadn't completed high school."
"Mr. Bachus","Right. Also regional banks. We had regional banks that did not do the subprime business because they couldn't originate them, and they didn't buy affiliates who did. And because of that, they were shut out of the mortgage business, and they went into a concentration of real estate. And now they are commercial real estate, and now that is their problem. But it was a problem over here that actually created that problem. Mr. Bowman, the House Republicans have proposed the most sweeping consolidation of regulators under one regulator with different charters, which is a different approach. I do want to say this, and I want to acknowledge your testimony. I think you do make--your argument has merit that you are really not addressing the arbitrage when you just go from 54 to 53, although I guess you could make the argument that you--but it certainly is--I think you do make--your argument has merit. One thing you say here that I think has--I have not heard before, but I think it is something that should be pointed out, the OTS did not regulate the largest banks that failed. The OTS regulated the largest banks that were allowed to fail, and that is one distinction. There were other, much larger institutions that were not allowed to fail. And I do think that there are-- your argument at least--I think it deserves consideration."
"Mr. Bowman","Congressman, thank you. I would like to add that in terms of the concept of arbitrage in general, we also do not believe that financial institutions, depository institutions and their holding companies go out and select a regulator, be it a State regulator or one of the Federal regulators, based upon what they hope to be a series of less than vigorous enforcement supervision. We just don't think that happens. We think it is an argument that doesn't hold a lot of water at the end of the day."
"Mr. Bachus","All right. And you do get facts and figures-- you had people moving from the OTS to the OCC. You had them moving. And they can also move from State to State, which you pointed out."
"Mr. Bowman","That is exactly right."
"Mr. Bachus","So I do think that you make a good point, and I think it is something that as we move forward, we--and as we try to decide that. The OTS has been to a certain extent, I think, maybe the sacrificial lamb in all that, I think."
"Mr. Bowman","Thank you."
"Mr. Bachus","And then there are other arguments that you made that I am not sure that most Members, including me, have considered, and that is many of the members were concentrating not only in real estate, which obviously was a major problem, but were also concentrating in California, those institutions that failed. And that was just as Atlanta--the other earlier conversations--Atlanta was a boom area, and your institutions happened to be in those areas that went up very fast and came down very fast."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Bachus. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes. Let me thank our panelists for being here today. Thank you for your patience. I would like very much to talk about the Consumer Finance Protection Agency, and I would also like to talk about the plight of small banks and regional banks, but I don't have enough time to do so. So I have decided that I am going to spend some time talking about the plight of minority banks, and before I do that, let the record show that my husband is an investor in a minority institution, and also let me disclose for the record that our broker, Merrill Lynch, has been taken over by a systemically important bank, the Bank of America. So I guess I better disclose that also. Now, having said that, the OTS and the FDIC are required to provide assistance to minority-owned banks under section 308 of FIRREA. The law requires banking regulators to preserve the present number of minority banks; preserve the minority character--or preserve the minority character of these banks in cases involving mergers or acquisitions of minority banks; provide technical assistance to prevent the insolvency of institutions that are not currently insolvent; promote and encourage the creation of new minority banks; and provide the training, technical assistance and education programs. The Federal Reserve and the OCC are not statutorily required to assist minority-owned banks, but you do have policies and programs to assist minority-owned banks. This appears to me to be opportunities that may be missed. Given what I have just read, what I have just indicated, I don't understand what you do to assist minority-owned banks in the ways that are described by law. And I would like to ask each of you if you could tell me if this is an area that perhaps you would just like to improve, if you haven't done a lot, or that you have done a lot, and I just don't know about it. I will start with Ms. Sheila Bair."
"Ms. Bair","We have an annual conference for minority depository institutions. We bring together technical experts and sources of capital investment, regulators speak, and we provide technical assistance. We have a program at Historically Black Colleges to help train bank management and to support careers with minority depository institutions. In terms of a resolution function, again, the resolution process is governed by Prompt Corrective Action, which is triggered by capital levels at banks, and is a very strict process. There is not a lot of flexibility there."
"Ms. Waters","What do you do to promote and encourage the creation of new minority banks?"
"Ms. Bair","We don't charter banks, but as part of the deposit insurance application process, we would weigh heavily in the balance of serving unmet needs in particular communities. We have had a few minority depository institution (MDI) failures and have actively recruited other MDIs to bid. We let them know about these situations. Acting Director Bowman and I personally intervened with Dwelling House in Pittsburgh to try to stabilize the situation and made some calls, and unfortunately we couldn't find an MDI acquirer. But it is something I have a personal interest in and a commitment to. And certainly if there are other ways we should be addressing this, I would be open to suggestions."
"Ms. Waters","I would like to know--while I am talking with you, let me talk a little bit about the opportunities that are being created as you dissolve and take over banks. You have some way by which you are selling off or asking the management of assets of those banks. You have other things that you are doing. Is there anything included in your efforts to include minority-owned banks in any way?"
"Ms. Bair","Well, if there is a minority depository institution that will be closed, our resolution staff will get on the phone and actively recruit other minority depository institutions and ask them to review the institution to bid. I think there were two situations where we had an MDI failure and were able to sell it to another MDI."
"Ms. Waters","What about nonminority-owned banks that are being taken over? How do you outreach to banks or organizations that would like to take over failed banks?"
"Ms. Bair","Well, I personally have had several meetings with those who have a particular interest in investing in MDIs. As part of our preresolution marketing process, we actively reach out to other MDIs to bid on MDIs that are going to fail. Somewhat related, we also have a good contractor outreach program. We have a very good record on minority contractors. Through a variety of outreach tools, we do have a strong commitment in this area. And again, if there are other things we can do, I would be open to suggestions."
"Ms. Waters","I think I have heard you talk about this before. This week we have the annual legislative conference of the Black Caucus in town, and we have money managers and minorities and financial services, various financial service organizations, and this is the number one topic because of the bailout, because of the $700-and-what billion that the citizens have made available to save the financially--the systemically important institutions. Minorities are complaining about a lack of involvement and opportunities across-the-board, from the Treasury to the FDIC to--you name it, and I just wish we had something to tell them this weekend."
"Ms. Bair","Congresswoman, we do have a good record. I have gotten a lot of positive feedback on our programs. If there are individuals who are complaining that they don't think there is appropriate access or education, I would like to know that, because I have gotten a lot of good feedback about our programs, and I think we have a very good story to tell on our minority contracts. We are happy to give those numbers to you. Again, if there are other things we can be doing, we are open to suggestions, but I have gotten a lot of positive feedback on our outreach efforts."
"Mr. Bowman","Congresswoman, if I could also add that we at the OTS in April of this year put together the Minority Depository Institution Advisory Committee, which is made up of 12 members, not all of whom are parts of existing minority depository institutions, but are other members of the community, including those that may or may not be a source of financing going forward. We have now met 4 times. We have discussed many different issues, including the very issues that you are asking about in terms of assistance: how to bring minority investors into the system; and how to bring additional capital that they would bring with them. We have going at the present time probably three different fairly active discussions with three groups of minority investors who are interested in looking at all institutions, not just minority institutions that are on the verge of failure or possible failure, but other institutions as well."
"Ms. Waters","If I may, there is a constant complaint about the inability to raise capital with these small and minority- owned banks. And they say, why can't we go to the Fed, why can't we be considered just as the systemically important banks are being considered for capital, for loans? What do you tell them when you meet with them about access to capital other than going out and finding private investors? Of course they are looking for that, and they are simply not looking for it from minority investors, they are looking for capital, period. What do you tell them, and how do you assist them in accessing capital?"
"Mr. Bowman","I think Chairman Bair referred to an instance at one of our institutions in Pennsylvania where she and others worked very hard to assist the minority institution in locating available capital. Ultimately, for a variety of reasons, it just was not there. The availability of capital today for all of our institutions, except some of the larger ones, is very, very difficult to come by regardless of who the investor might be or who the interested parties might be. The ability of any institution to raise capital continues to be a problem."
"Ms. Waters","Well, I guess, again, if I may, what the small and minority banks are saying is just as the bailout assisted the big banks, that are ``too-big-to-fail,'' why can't government come up with a program to assist small and minority- owned banks? And they remind us that they are not the ones that had the subprime meltdown, they weren't doing that kind of lending, yet they stand on the sidelines and they watch as the very people who caused the problem are assisted because they are ``too-big-to-fail.'' What can you think about, what possibly could happen for getting capital for these small and minority-owned banks? What kind of--would you, for example, be an advocate for assisting minority-owned banks with bailout money in different ways than is being done now?"
"Mr. Bowman","Certainly."
"Ms. Waters","Well, why don't you?"
"Mr. Bowman","We can have some of those conversations with the people who have the money, which includes Secretary Geithner and Chairman Bernanke. We can also have conversations with the Congress who can appropriate money."
"Ms. Waters","Well, here is what you can do. You can tell them that there is a law, FIRREA, that you are charged with preserving the present number of minority banks, preserving the minority character of these banks, providing technical assistance to prevent the insolvency, promote and encourage the creation of new minority banks, and provide the training, technical assistance and education; and you can tell them that this is all smoke and mirrors unless you have access to capital, and you think that something different ought to be done. Can we talk about that at some point, how we can assist these banks?"
"Ms. Bair","As regulators, we cannot be a source of capital. The FDIC is specifically prohibited by statute from making investments in open banks. So I think the TARP program is probably the most immediately available source if you are looking for government sources for capital. And certainly we can continue to do what we can appropriately. We have something called bank match where private investors who are interested in investing in smaller banks can go to our Web site."
"Ms. Waters","Let me ask you this, Ms. Bair: Is it possible that when you take over a bank and you have these assets to be managed, is it possible that some of these small and minority- owned banks could be a part of managing the assets of the failed banks? You have to contract it out to somebody, right?"
"Ms. Bair","Well, we sell the assets. Most of these assets are sold when the bank fails."
"Ms. Waters","You sell them rather than manage them; is that right?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes, that is right. So the acquirer will be the manager. We do have some assets that are harder to manage, and I believe we do have minority contractors helping with that. I can get those numbers for you. And we certainly are open to others who have an interest. I have met with a variety of groups who have interest. Mickey Collins, who is going to be talking to your caucus on Friday, has an extensive minority contractor outreach program. We want to make sure they understand the door is open, how the process works, the process of applying, and what opportunities exist."
"Ms. Waters","So you are selling the nonperforming assets or the performing assets of the banks that you take over, and the minorities who have been applying to purchase assets, I suppose there have been some, have been able to access those opportunities at this time?"
"Ms. Bair","It is a competitive bidding process, so whomever has the best price wins the bid. But, yes, I can think of at least two situations where a minority depository institution has been the successful bidder."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you. Are there any other ideas that you would like to share that--about how you can carry out FIRREA for the OTS and the FDIC? Any other ideas that you may have? And for the Federal Reserve and the OCC that are not statutorily required to assist, you are attempting to do something, I am told?"
"Mr. Dugan","Absolutely. And two points. We have a very active minority outreach technical assistance program that we take very seriously, and we participate actively in the conference that the FDIC sponsors each summer. We work with our minority institutions in a variety of ways, including, where appropriate, to try to match them up with other investors. For example, in the post-Katrina situation, we worked to match minority institutions up with potential investors at that time. And it is true we are not technically covered by that provision, but we try to act as if we are. We certainly would have no objection to being included in the same language. So I will be happy to provide more details on exactly the types of things that we have been doing, which, as I said, have been quite active."
"Mr. Bowman","Congresswoman, your question is exactly the kind of questions we are posing to our Minority Depository Institution Advisory Committee, asking them for some additional insight and ideas that might help other minority depository institutions going forward. And we would be happy to share the results of some of those discussions with you if you would like."
"Ms. Waters","Okay. I was just--my staff who works on this just passed me a note about the Temporary Liquidity Program. That is under what, FDIC?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes, that is a debt guarantee program and a transaction account guarantee program."
"Ms. Waters","Would you explain to me how you use this program to guarantee debt? As I understand it, the banks sell debt and raise capital. How does the program work?"
"Ms. Bair","We are winding it down actually. It is scheduled to expire October 31st. This is an emergency program we put in place early last October after the Lehman situation when the market was seizing up. It allowed most bank holding companies and thrift holding companies, for a temporary time period to issue debt, unsecured debt, that was guaranteed by the FDIC for a fee. We have collected over $9 billion so far from charging our guarantee fee. We have had no losses on the debt program. Also, as part of that, we added a transaction account guarantee. This was particularly helpful for the smaller banks. This enables participating banks to cover noninterest-bearing transaction accounts with unlimited deposit insurance-- insurance without caps. That program will go to June 30th."
"Ms. Waters","Should it be extended?"
"Ms. Bair","We have extended it until June 30th of next year. It is Congress' call if it should go beyond that. Congress sets our deposit insurance limits. This is something we did under a very extraordinary systemic risk procedure, which I am advised that we don't have the authority to make permanent. But we have extended it to June 30th of next year, and hopefully we will be stabilized by then."
"Ms. Waters","Is this something we should explore for assistance to the small and minority-owned banks between now and June 30th?"
"Ms. Bair","They have until June 30th of next year. It would be an open question whether they would feel there was a need after that. It does cost; obviously we charge a premium for it, because there are losses associated with that particular program. But, again, our deposit insurance limits typically are defined by Congress. We did this in an extraordinary process. So it really would be Congress' call whether the program should be extended beyond June 30th. A lot of banks are feeling that they will be able to exit it and will not need it after that."
"Ms. Waters","Let me just close by saying I know that you have had a number of seminars around the country. I understand there was one in Irvine, California, and that you have a database of minority-owned banks that invited small banks--that was invited to that conference?"
"Ms. Bair","Yes."
"Ms. Waters","We were not aware of it, and some of our small banks were not aware of it. I would like to--at some point in time, would each of you perhaps meet to talk about how we can perhaps share some information? And I would like to know more about how your programs work under FIRREA in particular, who the people are, how the programs are executed. And perhaps I can visit your institutions and you can have me talk with your people. They can talk with me about how they do this, and how it all works, and perhaps we can see how we can use some of our experiences to advise you about some possibilities for being more effective with FIRREA and other programs that are not necessarily under"
"FIRREA."," With that, thank you very much. The Chair notes that some members may have additional questions for this panel which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. With that, this hearing is adjourned. Thank you very much.                 "
