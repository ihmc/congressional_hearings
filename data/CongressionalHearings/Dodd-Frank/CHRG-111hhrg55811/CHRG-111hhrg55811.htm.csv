"Speaker","Speech"
"The Chairman","The hearing will come to order. The subject today is derivatives. I want to talk a little bit about the process and then about the substance. We are dealing with a set of issues that first came to light when Secretary Paulson set forward an agenda for regulation in April of 2008. Our attention was diverted for a while by an economic crisis. It was early this year when we felt that things had stabilized enough in the general economy in the credit area for us to take this up, and we have been working on it. It is very much a work in progress. Some people have said that we are rushing it. First, we have been studying this, many of us, since April of 2008. It has been on everybody's radar screen. Second--I am sorry, but my clock hasn't started. I apologize, but I meant it in a way that it should come out of my time, so I will cut myself off 30 seconds early. Yes, these things need to be studied. It is also the case though that some issues are not going to be joined until there are pieces of paper out there and people react to them. We have before us a discussion draft, which will and I believe should undergo significant change, but you have to start somewhere. This bill will not, on the best timetable, be signed by the President until December. I hope we can. We certainly will meet a timetable of getting legislation to the Floor in November. And it is a process, as I said, in which we will be putting things forward. It is a process in which a large number of Members participate. On the specific bill today, I agree with some of the criticisms that have been made. And again, I want to make it clear this was a discussion draft. Here is the goal, and we welcome participation in reaching it. It does seem to many of us that there is a distinction between derivatives as ends and derivatives as means. When we first began to talk about this, I expressed some views, for example, about prohibiting naked credit default swaps. I did not expect people in the business of selling these, people in the financial industry, to be happy with that. They weren't. As I said, we didn't expect them to be. We didn't care whether they were or weren't. What we began to hear were objections to some of this from those people for whom derivatives are not an end for making money as they are for the financial institutions, but a means so that they can go about their business of producing goods and services with some stability, with some reasonable expectation about cost. Derivatives are a very legitimate way for producers of end products, goods or services, to reduce volatility, which is very important for them to be able to make the calculations they make. Our job is to find a way to preserve that legitimate function while diminishing the excessive volatility that comes from people who are doing it to speculate, from diminishing the risk that comes when people get overextended in doing it. And it has been a process that is still in place. I notice, for instance, that Mr. Hu said that the discussion draft could unintentionally preserve existing regulatory gaps. He is quite right that it is unintentional. We will look for this expertise to deal with it. Chairman Gensler told me yesterday that he thought that in the bill, it created a presumption against having things go essentially cleared, and that is exactly the opposite of our intention. I want to say at this point that the staff of the Financial Services Committee has, in my judgment, given America this year the best value for its money that it has ever gotten. These are very intelligent dedicated people who work very hard, who put up with a lot from a lot of people, me sometimes included, and all of whom could be making a lot more money doing similar work under less stressful conditions elsewhere. I have been urging them to get these drafts out so they can be discussed. If I thought we were going to get it right the first time, every time, then I guess we wouldn't need hearings, and we wouldn't need markups; we would just take them all up on the Floor. And I acknowledge, and let me just say to my friends in the regulatory area, yes, I acknowledge there are some areas here where there are gaps that shouldn't have been there. There is this, and there may be a distinction here--I do believe that there is a need to distinguish between legitimate end-users and people who are there because this is a profit incentive for them. Now, having said that, it is clear we can't expect financial institutions to be available to help the end-users as a charity. They need to make a profit or they will not be available to provide that liquidity, which is important. But that is the line we want to draw. I have read this over, and I think we have in the first cut--well, this is the second cut because we put something out. I backed off some of the things, listening to the end-users. I think there is some room now to tighten up some of what we are doing. It is our intention to have a push in favor of clearing but a recognition that it won't always be possible. We picked up some things, like to the extent that this collateralization will not have to be cash. The last point I would make is this: If we were starting from scratch, we would only have one person here. There would be an SEC/FTC; there wouldn't be an SEC and a CFTC. But we are not starting from scratch. Trying to merge these two would divert attention. What is important is that we work together, both legislatively and going forward, to harmonize their work, and that is going to be our goal. And next, I recognize the gentleman from Alabama for 4 minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","I thank the chairman. And we do have two gentlemen here with us, so I am not seeing double. I thank the chairman for convening the hearing. And as the chairman said, derivatives are an essential tool used by countless American companies to help them manage risk associated with doing business both at home and abroad. Derivatives allow companies to hedge against risk, deploy capital effectively, lower costs, and offer protection against fluctuating prices. There is nothing inherently wrong with derivatives. It is when they are abused. Congress must take steps to ensure increased transparency and enhance oversight of the derivatives market. However, any new regulation should not hamper the ability of businesses to control costs, manage risk, compete in the global marketplace, and create jobs. Last Friday, the chairman released draft derivatives legislation which represents a significant improvement over the proposal that the Obama Administration submitted to Congress in August. I commend him for that. The chairman's draft wisely omits provisions from the Administration's proposal which would have severely restricted access to the derivatives marketplace and had the effect of magnifying rather than mitigating systemic risk. However, while the chairman should be commented for addressing several of the serious flaws in the Administration's approach, there are a number of issues, I think, that still require careful attention. For example, the chairman's draft would still require that some over-the-counter products be shifted onto venues like clearinghouses and exchanges. I think he has acknowledged today that may not always be possible. The bill also calls on the regulators to classify some actors in the derivatives marketplace as major swap participants. This vague classification could force thousands of companies to divert millions of dollars of capital away from business investment for use as cash collateral. It seems counterintuitive during a recession, with unemployment approaching 10 percent, to leave companies exposed to greater risk, raise their cost to capital, and make economic recovery more difficult to achieve. Another potentially troublesome provision of the discussion draft, and the chairman discussed this, was prohibiting certain swap transactions. Restriction on credit default swap contracts limits the ability of investors to appropriately calculate risk as it has become apparent that CDS spreads are often a more accurate reflection of credit risk than credit ratings. There is nothing inherently wrong with credit default swaps. And even in the last year I think that has been confirmed. It is when they are abused, as in the case of subprime mortgage securities, which were improperly rated and underwritten, that problems arise. It was the subprime loans that made up the securitizations, not the credit default swaps themselves, that caused the problem. Mr. Chairman, as we move forward with regulatory reform, we should make every effort to strike the right balance between maintaining market stability and preserving useful innovations in the U.S. financial services industry. While the government certainly has a role in policing the derivative marketplace, it must be noted that there are private sector initiatives already under way to clear standardized derivative contracts and establish trade repositories that will furnish the information regulators and investors need to make informed judgments about potential systemic risk and counterparty exposures. Legislation in this area should seek to facilitate and, where appropriate, codify these market-based solutions while not subjecting U.S. companies that operate far from Wall Street to damaging new regulatory burden. I thank the chairman, and I welcome our two witnesses."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from North Carolina for 2 minutes."
"Mr. Watt","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And let me try to do two things in the 2 minutes I have. Number one is to applaud the Chair for this whole process that he is going through, because as he indicated, you can go down a road, and then you have to reevaluate, which is what the hearings do, and then you have to redraft. So I just think the process that we have been following is an entirely appropriate and thoughtful and meaningful process to get to the right balance. Number two, it is probably appropriate that I come after the ranking member here because I actually have some strong feelings on an issue that probably counter the ranking member's position, and I think that the most recent draft may have tilted us in a direction that is more contrary to what we are trying to achieve. And I specifically refer to the language on pages 27 and 28 of the chairman's most recent draft, discussion draft, where I think we have perhaps created a loophole that is way, way, way too big for major swap dealers and people who are engaged in major swap participants. So I think we need to look carefully at that language in particular, and I will be, as I go through this bill, am trying to do that in a responsible way, but remembering that our objective here was to create real transparency in this market, and we need to stay focused on doing that."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Oklahoma. I am going to go to the gentleman from Oklahoma and the gentlewoman from Illinois, so we have equal amounts of time. The gentleman from Oklahoma for 1\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Lucas","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing. I think the discussion draft the committee has before it today is an interesting next step in our review of the overall counterderivatives market. Since the Administration's proposal on this issue was published on August 11th, the end-user community has been constantly knocking on my door. As ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, I listened to the testimony of the end-user community, the exchanges and the traders, when they appeared in front of that committee on September 17th. The common theme to the testimony was that the Administration's proposal overreached and would treat many bona fide hedgers as systematically risky financial institutions. Are there problems in the derivatives markets? Yes. What we cannot do is overreach or overregulate. If we do, the impact will be felt far beyond Wall Street and reach Main Street. It will cost jobs, economic development, and ultimately increase the prices consumers pay for energy, food, and manufactured goods. I am anxious to hear from our second panel today if this draft allows effective legitimate domestic risk management better than the Administration's proposal. And I am equally anxious to hear if our regulators still want to regulate everybody to avoid regulatory arbitrage or if they recognize the concerns that we shared when they appeared in front of the House Agriculture Committee that their approach will make risk management too expensive and increase prices and volatility. Mr. Chairman, we need to improve the safety and soundness of our financial regulation, but we cannot do it at the expense of economic development, increased prices, and job losses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Illinois for 1\1/2\ minutes."
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think that the new draft has some troubling things in it. In its current form, I am afraid there is still a one-size- fits-all approach to regulating derivatives and a ``Big Brother'' regulatory model that may stifle innovation, unnecessarily tie up capital, and see owners standards on businesses, exchanges, and clearinghouses. The bill doesn't seem like the right answer to reforming the OTC marketplace at a time when our feeble economy is trying to regain steam and at a time when we need businesses to use capital to invest in their businesses to grow and create jobs for Americans. We all know that there were abuses in the OTC markets. They must be addressed. But to my knowledge, when the entire financial system was on the verge of collapse last fall, the futures markets pulled through. This bill doesn't seem to, in a targeted approach, address those abuses, but rather considers all parties, anti-users as well as end-users as well as exchanges risky and treat them as such. Non-risky market participants may now unnecessarily have increased capital requirements, mandatory central clearing margin requirements, and product approval by bureaucrats in Washington. This doesn't seem like the right answer to managing risk and addressing abuses in the marketplace. We need robust competition, restored investor confidence, and healthier markets. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New York, Mr. McMahon. I would ask unanimous consent that Mr. McMahon be allowed to ask questions out of our 10 minutes. Is there any objection? I hear none. I thank the Minority for accommodating Mr. McMahon. Let me just say, while he is not a member of this committee because by the time he came to Congress, there was no room, and I must say, not to take away from anybody's time, I am glad that the Speaker finally recognized that there is some limit to the size of this committee. I think that she thought that we were infinite. So I regret Mr. McMahon not being able to join us, but I had to accept the principle. But Mr. McMahon is someone whose district is heavily involved in this, has some expertise, and that is why I asked that he be able to ask some questions. And I thank our colleagues on all sides for allowing it. The gentleman is recognized for 3 minutes."
"Mr. McMahon","Thank you, Chairman Frank, and Ranking Member Bachus, and all the members of the committee for allowing me to join you today at this very important hearing. I would also like to especially thank Chairman Frank and his dedicated staff for putting together this balanced discussion draft as an excellent starting point for our deliberations in working with my legislative director Jeff Siegel, who has done an outstanding job as well. I know I can speak for many of my colleagues and the new Democrats when I say that we look forward to working with you constructively to improve this draft in the days ahead. Although the regulation of derivatives is complex, this issue is extremely important to the proper functioning of our capital markets and to almost every business in America, and we need to get this right. We all know the effect of derivatives and what role they played in particular with the credit default swaps in the collapse of AIG and the broader credit crisis. Derivatives amplified the effects of the subprime mortgage crisis and the overleveraging of our economy. There is no doubt that we need much greater transparency and regulation of our derivative markets to be sure that we do not have to face another AIG-type collapse or spend billions of dollars bailing out companies for taking imprudent risks. But we must be sure that any new regulation is smart and rational regulation. We need to target any new rules to directly address the potential for systemic risk without needless imposing of regulations that could have unintended effects. Because derivatives are financial instruments that help all of us, they help keep our energy costs low and stable. They help insurance companies keep premiums low. They help companies complete construction projects on time and under budget. And despite the negative press and lack of understanding of the derivatives market, for the most part, the derivatives market works. We cannot throw the baby out with the bath water. We must work to protect the end-users, good American businesses that are just trying to manage their cash flows and hedge against uncertain risks beyond their control in a cost- effective manner. We should work to require standardized trades between entities that pose systemic risk, swap dealers, and major swap participants to clear their trades. For products that are more unique, those should continue to be traded in the OTC markets but with higher margin and capital requirements for the big players. At the same time, we must increase transparency and disclosure requirements and grant regulators the authority to monitor these important markets for any sign of stress or overexposure. Our derivative markets need more regulation, but we also must be sure not to needlessly tie up capital or increase the cost of credit in ways that stifle economic growth or risk sending our financial services industry overseas, particularly important to the 80,000 people from my district in Staten Island and Brooklyn, New York, who work every day in the financial services industry. In this age of instant global capital flows, if the regulations are not carefully written, any poorly conceived rule here in Washington could have a dramatic impact on our economy. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I again thank you for the honor of being here today."
"The Chairman","I thank the gentleman. He yielded minus 4 seconds. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 1\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. As I look at all the root causes of our economic turmoil, I haven't quite convinced myself that the derivatives market is among them. We all certainly know what happened to AIG's Financial Products Unit with the credit default swaps. I am sure not sure that wasn't a symptom as opposed to a cause. Now, clearly, their behavior in retrospect was reckless, and I for one do not agree that the taxpayer should have been asked to pick up the tab. Be that as it may, it is important to know as we go forward what the history is, and the history is that the relevant regulator did not lack regulatory authority. They may have lacked regulatory expertise, but they did not lack regulatory authority. Now, as we look at the new draft of the derivatives bill, I would like to commend the chairman for significantly improving the Administration's bill. It is only 10:20 in the morning, and I find myself in the unusual position of having agreed with my chairman 3 times now, and the day is early. It probably won't happen again any time soon. But, nonetheless, I think that it is important that all of us realize that ultimately derivatives have a very important function in our market. Many of us have received correspondence from the Coalition for Derivatives End-Users. I would like to quote from that letter, which includes 170 of the largest job creators in America, ``Business end-users rely on OTC derivatives to manage risk, including currency exchange, interest rates and commodity prices by insulating companies from risk; customize OTC derivatives; provide businesses with access to lower capital, enabling them to grow, make new investments and retain and create new jobs.'' We should be very, very loathe to ruin that. Thank you. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman's time has expired. And indeed, I would recommend that the gentleman take the rest of the day off. The gentleman from New Jersey is recognized for 1\1/2\ minutes."
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the Chair. When viewed in the context of the proposal that the Administration previously put forward, the chairman's discussion draft is basically an improvement in many respects. But when we review it in the broader context of exactly what problems we are trying to solve with several new layers of cumbersome bureaucracy over a huge part of the economy that has nothing to do with our financial troubles, the bill really does look less attractive. The bill sets up a dual regulatory regime with the CFTC and the SEC, two agencies that, quite frankly, have a poor record of working together. Not only that, we are essentially setting that up to be prudential regulators, something that they are not equipped to do and which the SEC has already failed at, over non-financial companies that really don't need this prudential regulation. So, to me, that is a fundamental flaw with a basic structure of the bill. Rather than certainty, there is a clumsy sort of multi-regulator approach to the derivative market that will breed widespread uncertainty, uncertainty that will reduce credit availability, hamper risk management, and cost jobs in the broader economy. And while end-users may think that the direction that the bill has headed from is better, this legislation will still set up a regime with the authority to propose mandatory requirements and capital that could have negative consequences on them in the end. There is also a mandatory clearing component that I fear could rush cooperative buy-side and sell- side and regulatory effects to responsibly address the central clearing issue and could increase rather than decrease the potential for systemic risk in the process. I have other concerns as well, and I hope that this committee and the second panel as well can explore it further. Thank you. I yield back."
"The Chairman","We will now begin with our witnesses. We have the Chair of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission. And let me acknowledge, particularly in the presence of the ranking member of that committee, that the primary jurisdiction over this agency is in the Agriculture Committee. And I want to say I am very pleased because I think jurisdictional disputes are Congress at its worst. Egos and pettiness come out. We have worked very closely with the Agriculture Committee, that was in complete agreement, and I thank the gentleman for acknowledging that. We even had an unusual joint hearing on the subject. And we will continue to work with the Agriculture Committee because cooperation between our two committees, as between these two agencies, is essential if we are going to get this job done."
"Chairman Gensler"," "
"STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE GARY GENSLER, CHAIRMAN, COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION"," "
"Mr. Gensler","Thank you, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. I am pleased to testify today regarding OTC derivatives reform and the discussion draft. I also want to commend your staff, Mr. Chairman--David, Peter, Jeanne, Lawranne and others who have worked tirelessly on this, and I agree with that. AIG demonstrates the need for comprehensive regulatory reform. Every single taxpayer in this room, every member of this committee put money into that failed institution. Nearly $414 million per each of your congressional districts went into AIG. Now, I would like to address much-needed regulatory reform in the context of two principle goals: lowering risk for the American public; and promoting transparency of the markets. At the conclusion of last month's G-20 summit, President Obama and other heads of state made these two goals, lowering risk and promoting transparency, key. And I am just going to quote from that statement: ``All standardized OTC derivatives-- this is President Obama and 20 heads of state--all standardized OTC derivatives contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms where appropriate and cleared through central counterparties by end 2012 at the latest.'' It is I think our challenge now, our challenge as an Administration and regulators and hopefully working with Congress, to achieve this goal. We need to lower risk in the system for the American public. That is going to require capital standards explicitly set for the large financial institutions. They already have capital, but we should be explicit about it: margins, so that we lower the risk with the counterparties; business conduct standards to make sure that boring stuff in the back office works; and, yes, importantly, centralized clearing on those products that can be cleared, still accommodating customized products, but central clearing is key. Transparency is the second key principle. And as we discuss proposals of OTC derivatives, I believe it is inherent that we get this right. But, first, strict recordkeeping and reporting requirements should be established and vigorously enforced. Second, that all noncleared transactions should be reported to a trade repository. Third, that the data on transaction should be available and aggregated for the public so the public can address an information deficit they have on these markets. But fourth, very critically, that standardized part of the market, those products that can be brought to an exchange or trading venue be moved onto these facilities so we have the same benefit that we have in the securities and futures markets of transparency. Every economist that looks at transparency, it benefits markets. I will just now briefly turn to six quick issues raised by the discussion draft. First, the discussion draft shifts the Administration's proposals presumption that all standardized derivatives be cleared to one where product will be cleared only if required by a market regulator and then puts the burden on the regulators to possibly do this contract-by-contract. Second, end-users' transactions should be brought to the central clearinghouse to lower risk. End-users should be allowed to enter into individualized credit arrangements with their financial institutions, but the Administration's proposal would still get the benefit of central clearing, again, only on the part of the transactions that can be cleared, not the customized transactions. We think if there is an end-user exception that Congress believes they need to endorse that it be very narrowly defined, as the chairman said, to address non- financial entities that use swaps to hedge actual commercial risk as contrasted to financial entities. Third, the discussion draft widens an exception for major swap participants. It was the goal of the Administration bill to cover major swap participants. We are concerned that it may be an unintended consequence that swaps entered into for risk management purposes would not be covered and as thus the major swap participant category would be so narrowed inadvertently. Fourth, the discussion draft makes trading on regulated exchanges or regulated trading platforms available but not required. And as I said, I think that transparency is critical to the markets and for all of the end-users that have concerns elsewhere in the bill, this actually benefits end-users to have the transparency in pricing. I don't know why we would accommodate it, and it is natural that Wall Street might have a different view of this, but we are trying to recommend things that benefit Main Street and end-users who use these products. Fifth, U.S. regulators must work with international regulators to protect the American public. We just look forward to working with the committee to make sure that any efforts to accommodate foreign regulatory standards do not inadvertently permit market participants to shop for lax foreign regulators. And then, lastly, the discussion draft could inadvertently enable standardized agricultural swaps to be traded bilaterally off exchange. It does not impose the protections that we believe are necessary for the market. In addition to these points, we look forward to working with you in the next several days on other technical thoughts. We look forward to working with the SEC as well. Next week, we are going to be reporting on the request the President made that we look to harmonize our rules, and we look forward to making that available to this committee and Congress to help in these efforts. Thank you. "
"The Chairman","Thank you. Mr. Hu is the Director of the SEC's new Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation. Mr. Hu? "
"STATEMENT OF HENRY HU, DIRECTOR, DIVISION OF RISK, STRATEGY, AND FINANCIAL INNOVATION, U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"," "
"Mr. Hu","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission concerning the Over- the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009 proposed in August by the Treasury Department, and the discussion draft recently circulated by the chairman. I am especially pleased to appear with CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler, with whom the SEC has worked closely over the last several months on a variety of issues. Both of our Commissions are eager to address these issues and ensure that remaining differences are justified by meaningful distinctions between markets and products. As you know, the recent financial crisis revealed serious weaknesses in the U.S. financial regulation, including gaps in the regulatory structure. Both the SEC and the CFTC are fully committed to filling gaps and shoring-up the regulatory system. One significant gap is the lack of regulation of OTC derivatives, which were largely excluded from the regulatory framework in 2000 by the Commodity Futures Modernization Act. OTC derivatives present a number of risks. They can facilitate significant leverage, enable concentrations of risk, and behave unexpectedly in times of crisis. And while some derivatives can reduce certain risks, they can also cause others. Importantly, these risks are heightened by the lack of regulatory oversight of dealers and other market participants-- a combination that can lead to insufficient capital, inadequate risk management standards, and associated failures cascading through the global financial system. Lastly, the largely unregulated derivatives market can also undermine the regulated securities and futures markets by luring participants to a less-regulated alternative. The discussion draft is an important step forward in improving transparency and establishing the necessary regulatory framework. While it would go a long way towards improving the regulation of OTC derivatives, I believe it should be strengthened in several ways. First, to minimize regulation arbitrage, swaps should be regulated like their underlying references. Market participants often view derivatives and the underlying assets they reference as substitutes. Whether the participation is direct or indirect, the same or similar economic effects can often be achieved. As a result, even subtle differences in the regulation of economic substitutes can lead to gaming advantages for any one participant. But that participant's regulatory arbitrage activity, and a general migration to the less-regulated derivatives markets, can undermine the interest of other participants, as well as everyone's interest in minimizing fraud and systemic risk. The easiest way to achieve this goal is to move over the existing securities regime to securities- related swaps. If Congress decides to retain the bill's existing rulemaking framework, it should include these swaps within the definition of securities within the Federal securities laws. This will ensure that existing protections and authority can automatically flow through to these products. Exemptions could be provided where needed. I believe it is better to start from an existing framework for substantially similar products than to start from scratch not knowing what might be missed in some cross reference, not knowing what future financial innovation may bring. Second, it is essential that the legislation address anti- fraud authority matters and provide the tools needed to appropriately enforce anti-fraud authority. The discussion draft seeks to retain certain existing anti-fraud authority over, for instance, certain broad-based swaps, but may have inadvertently weakened that authority over certain other related swaps. The SEC should also have the tools needed to effectively exercise the anti-fraud authority. The discussion draft recognizes the importance of inspections and examinations of swap dealers and major participants to the SEC. We recommend that this authority be extended to central counterparties and swap repositories, so that regulators can have quick access to comprehensive data. Third, the discussion draft should clarify that the definition of ``securities-based swap'' includes not only single and narrow-based credit default swaps but broad-based credit default swaps where payment is triggered by a single security or small group of securities. Fourth, the legislation should narrow the ``risk management'' exclusion for major swap participants. Regulation of major swap participants and dealers is a vital part of the OTC regulatory regime. We do understand that there may be entities that use swaps that should not fall into this new framework. The discussion draft, however, effectively provides an exclusion for major participants who hold positions, ``for risk management purposes.'' The term ``risk management'' is ambiguous and could cause a large number of important entities to fall outside this new regime. Finally, the legislation should direct regulators to adopt stronger business conduct rules to protect less sophisticated investors and end-users. In closing, this proposal makes significant strides towards addressing current problems in the OTC derivatives marketplace. I look forward to continuing to work with this committee, the Congress, the Treasury, and the CFTC to enact strong legislation in this area. Thank you for the opportunity to testify here today. I look forward to answering your questions. "
"The Chairman","Thank you. As I said, I think we appreciate and we are in agreement with much of what you say. There will be some disagreements. Let me start off with two points, though. Some of the points you make, Mr. Gensler and also Mr. Hu, you have to take them to the Agriculture Committee. For example, your proposal--your objection to the swaps between agriculture entities, it would be an intrusion on the jurisdiction of the Agriculture Committee, and we will be working on this together. We will be submitting our bill, and they will be offering some amendments. Where you were talking about a swap between agriculture entities, you have to take it to them. I have said that I think there is a presumption that we have jurisdiction over things that aren't edible, but they are certainly clearly in charge of the edible, not just that, but I guess tangible is a better way of putting it. So, secondly, Mr. Hu, I will say that some of your points similarly are jurisdictional issues between yourself and the CFTC. And that means between us and the Agriculture Committee. There are some substantive issues where I very much agree and a couple where I don't agree, but I do want to say, as I go through your points, some of them will have to go to the Agriculture Committee. For example, Mr. Gensler, your fourth point where you say the discussion draft makes trading on regulated exchanges or regulated trading available to swap dealers but not required. And then, again, that is covered in your sixth point, agriculture swaps. Let me put it this way, for agriculture swaps, you need to deal with the Agriculture Committee. On your fourth point, to the extent that we are dealing with swaps that are not agriculture, we would be inclined to agree with you. So points four and six, you will have to split those. Let me just go through a couple of the other points you make. On the question of clearing, no, we did not mean to have a presumption against clearing. I do think it is appropriate to have the presumption in favor of clearing, understanding when it doesn't happen, so we will work with you on that. And you should, I believe, have the authority to deal with a broad class of swaps, even under that presumption. And again, the two of you together. I assume this is one."
"Mr. Hu","We are good friends."
"The Chairman","That one point appears in both of your statements, so on that one, we are there. On the clearing requirements for end-users, you say you recommend that they all go to a clearinghouse. I don't think you are going to see that happen because of the response that many will have to the end-users. But at the bottom of the page, you say, ``To the extent that Congress decides not to follow this approach, any clearing exceptions for end-users should be very narrowly defined to only include non-financial entities that use swaps incidental to their business to hedge actual commercial risk.'' That is the essence of what we are trying to do. We will work with you to do this. But I do have one question. Obviously, when you mention insurance, people think of AIG, which was a major problem here. But is it possible to make a distinction between insurance qua insurance, and insurance companies that make so much money they won't get themselves in trouble? That is, we generally agree with this financial non-financial. But there is a definitional question about insurance. People who are in the business of selling insurance to policyholders, how would you classify them in this? Obviously, if an insurance company is engaging in non- insurance-related transactions like AIG, they should not be exempted. But what about an insurance company that is selling life insurance or automobile insurance?"
"Mr. Gensler","We would believe that insurance companies should be under, just like other financial firms and bring their standard product, not the customized product, but to the benefit of the clearinghouse."
"The Chairman","We will be working on that one, because there is I think some question that was there. And then both of you, I guess, had this issue. You worry that our exemption for risk management, that could be a huge loophole. I agree that it could be a loophole, and people want to make it one. I would hope you would work with us so that we could define risk management better, both substantively and procedurally. That is, we would define risk management, and you would be the primary deciders of that. And the fact that someone was doing something that met GAAP, we wouldn't be interfering with GAAP, but that would not be dispositive of the issue. They couldn't say, well, this is risk management according to GAAP, therefore, you guys mind your own business. Work with us on that, because, again, there is more common agreement here on the goal, and we would be able to deal with this. Finally, let me say, Mr. Gensler, you say market participants should only be exempt from American regulation where there has been a determination by U.S. regulators that the foreign regulatory scheme is comprehensible and comparable. Agreed, we will do that. So, as I said, I think we will probably still do more for end-users in terms of exemptions than you would like. But in almost every other case, we are in agreement, saving those where you are going to have to take it to the Agriculture people."
"Mr. Gensler","I thank the chairman for that quick review. If I could just comment on two of the points. On exchange trading, I take it that maybe we are closer together that we should mandate the benefits of either exchange or these execution facilities. Accommodating some transactions that are illiquid and too large can come to a mandate."
"The Chairman","Mandate is too strong a word. You talked about a presumption. There would be a presumption that they would be there, and you would have the ability to decide that. I don't know how you mandate them all, and then you say you can't mandate everything except for a few."
"Mr. Gensler","But to require those products that are able to be cleared--"
"The Chairman","Yes, so burden of proof should be on those to show you that they can't be."
"Mr. Gensler","That those would not only have the benefit of clearing but also exchange trading or trading venues."
"The Chairman","Right. Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","Chairman Frank, I truly welcome your remarks about the risk management exclusion."
"The Chairman","It is always nice to feel welcome, Mr. Hu."
"Mr. Hu","A Texas-size welcome. I really welcome it because--"
"The Chairman","Okay. Since you agree, I can't take time to do that. Do you have any--"
"Mr. Hu","Yes. In terms of the exclusion, we are calling for objective, narrow, and verifiable notions of ``risk management.''"
"The Chairman","All right. We will deal with that. I am taking other people's time, and I can't do that. We have a conceptual agreement. We will work with you. The gentleman from New Jersey."
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the chairman. And I thank the members of the panel. The first question, I guess, is for both of you. On page 165 of the draft, it states that margin requirements for swaps set by the SEC and the CFTC for end-users shall provide for non-cash collateral, non-cash assets as collateral. The way I read this is it doesn't mean that they always have to do so, but they have some flexibility in there. Is that the way you read it? And if so, then how will you actually implement the use of those assets? And if not, do you have broader authority than that under this direct proposal?"
"Mr. Gensler","We believe that in working with the committee, we can get this right, but that end-users should be able to enter into individual credit arrangements with the swap houses and the financial entities, and that would be allowed non-cash collateral in that regard. But that which could be cleared could still be brought to the clearinghouse and benefit from that lower risk."
"Mr. Hu","In terms of how we interpret this provision, as we understand it, this provision applies to dealers accepting non- cash collateral. And in terms of non-cash collateral, it could be things like Treasury bills. Highly liquid matters could fall under that rubric. The provision does not, we understand, apply to clearinghouses. In terms of clearinghouses, we are hoping that, in fact, the requirement in terms of collateral would be involving a tighter rein by regulators."
"Mr. Garrett","Through the clearinghouse, then, what is the tighter range--what would potentially the clearinghouses be required to provide if not those assets? Would they require cash assets, cash?"
"Mr. Hu","Well, we allow things like--"
"Mr. Garrett","But could they--under the authority, could the circumstances be that it is not going to be non-cash assets, but they could actually have to require cash?"
"Mr. Hu","In terms of our existing clearinghouses that the SEC regulates, we do allow things like money market funds and other kinds of liquid, high-quality assets."
"Mr. Garrett","And if those are required, could that not cause a deleterious effect upon the end-users at the end of the day? I know the end-users at this point feel, hey, we have been sort of carved out, and we are happy about this, but if the clearinghouse arrangement is not done in that particular manner, the authority is broad enough to actually require, that they may not be as scot-free in this as they think they may be?"
"Mr. Hu","There are two possible ways in which those concerns are alleviated. First, the SEC historically has viewed clearinghouses as public utilities subject to heavy regulation to make sure that there is open access--and that the fees are reasonable and the other requirements are reasonable. The second way is that we really want to do everything we can to ensure the safety and soundness of clearinghouses, a central element to minimizing the AIG interconnectedness problem."
"Mr. Garrett","So it might take away from this, is that is going to be a paramount requirement and concern of you is the systemic risk aspect of the clearinghouses and their soundness of that, and so that will be--that would trump necessarily, under certain circumstances, potentially over the end-users situation. I only have a little bit of time. You also, Mr. Hu, spoke to the issue of trading swaps--I will use layman's terms-- trading swaps, basically, and implementation of the rules with the same manner and such as derivatives, right, in your opening statement."
"Mr. Hu","To have securities-related swaps being treated like securities would help simplify matters."
"Mr. Garrett","Does it simplify matters? In actuality, how does that actually play out in real life? Because under the rules that you would have to apply to them, can they basically implement them and carry them out in the same timely manner that you would necessarily do it with the swaps?"
"Mr. Hu","Well, in terms of that issue, right now there is a distinction, for instance, between broad-based security-based swaps and narrowly-based security swaps. Broad-based security swaps basically fall under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, while security-based swaps and narrow-based security swaps fall under the jurisdiction of the SEC. We feel that because of the arbitrage possibilities from using two broad-based security-based swaps to get targeted exposure to a single company or a narrow group of companies, that it allows for easy gaming. By simplifying things to treat, for instance, all security-based swaps as securities and falling within the parameters of the Federal securities laws simplifies matters, reduces the possibility of gaming of gaps, and facilities more efficient responses."
"Mr. Gensler","We think that the Administration proposal and the discussion draft got this right, and it kept in line the 27-year arrangement where broad-based indices and futures and derivatives on them are regulated by one. And the market regulator and the narrow-based are by the SEC. Of course, the chairman noted, we are two agencies, so there are boundaries."
"Mr. Hu","May I quickly respond to that?"
"The Chairman","No. There is an interagency here. We will have to move on. I will have to tell the SEC, you are up against a pretty high hill if you have the Administration and the Agriculture Committee on one side."
"Mr. Garrett","And that is the uncertainty that I guess we are questioning."
"The Chairman","But it is certainly our responsibility to resolve it. The gentleman brought up an important issue. The gentleman from Pennsylvania."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, allow me to congratulate Mr. Gensler and the SEC. You are certainly a lot closer than you were 2 months ago when we had our opening discussions as to what to do. I do have a question, and I guess the last question by Mr. Garrett really triggers it. What unresolved problems in the jurisdiction between the two agencies have not yet been resolved, and when will it be resolved?"
"Mr. Gensler","We intend next week to report to the President and the Congress on a report of the gaps in our oversight. And in that, we will be having a series of recommendations, some related to enforcement matters, some related to product review, cross margining. It looks across the whole gamut of issues between our two regulatory approaches and makes recommendations, where appropriate, to Congress; some recommendations for ourselves in rule writing."
"Mr. Hu","On September 2nd and 3rd, the SEC and the CFTC held historic joint meetings to seek input from the public on the harmonization of regulation and futures. It was very successful, and there have been ongoing discussions on a wide range of matters, and the talks have been going very well."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Very good. All in all, looking at the discussion draft do you see anything so fundamentally offensive that you would not be supportive of its enactment into law?"
"Mr. Gensler","Congressman Kanjorski, we look forward to working with this committee and Congress to enhance this important step. But as I highlighted, we do believe that the American public needs to benefit from the full transparency that comes from getting the standard part of this market onto trading platforms and exchanges. We do want to narrow this exception for major swap participants and in the presumptions that we talked about in the other areas in the testimony. We think those are important so that we cover this entire marketplace."
"Mr. Hu","We do think it is important in terms of the securities framework that it basically apply to substitutes, to economic substitutes. Otherwise the dangers of arbitrage and gaps occurring are too serious."
"Mr. Kanjorski","Very good. Mr. Chairman, I have had an opportunity to ask a lot of questions in the past. Let me yield back to the Chair so other members may have an opportunity."
"The Chairman","I thank the gentleman. And I apologize, I should have gone directly--I wasn't looking at my list--to the gentleman from Oklahoma who serves on this committee and is also the ranking member of the Agriculture Committee, and so he has been an important part of our trying with the gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott, and some others, Mr. Minnick, to try to make sure that our two committees are at least abreast of what each are doing. The gentleman from Oklahoma."
"Mr. Lucas","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate your observations, and I think we have very good working relationship, the House Agriculture Committee having passed an earlier attempt at this reform concept this year, and now Chairman Peterson indicates that we may well be addressing another series of hearings and potentially markups to have a companion bill. So, let me direct my first question to the Securities and Exchange Commission. SEC has had anti-fraud and anti- manipulation jurisdiction over credit derivative markets since 2000. Could you list for us, please, how many cases the SEC has brought and in what years those cases were initiated?"
"Mr. Hu","There is one very important case going on right now that involves using credit derivatives for insider trading purposes--involving people who learned about certain restructuring events at a company and whom the SEC believes used credit default swaps as a way of betting on that particular transaction. One of the great things about this bill, relating to your question, is in terms of being able to bring more cases by being able to look more carefully at the transactions going on. There is a drastic increase in transparency flowing from the clearinghouses and the swap repositories. With this greater transparency, it would help us ensure a greater ability to detect market manipulation."
"Mr. Lucas","So, in the last 8 years, we have had how many cases brought?"
"Mr. Hu","Congressman, I am afraid--"
"Mr. Lucas","That you are aware of."
"Mr. Hu","Congressman, I am afraid I have been at the SEC all of 4 weeks, and I will have to get back to you and find out about the other cases."
"Mr. Lucas","Since we are talking about, in many cases, some substantial increase in enforcement authority, I think it would be fascinating to know how many have been brought under existing rules in a very complicated time, so I look forward to that, very much, to that response. Now, I address this to both of you. Looking at the way this draft proposal is crafted, tell me what kind of resource increases, both personnel and dollars, would you expect from an administrative perspective you will have to have to implement the language, assuming we ultimately come up with a bill very similar to this draft."
"Mr. Gensler","Congressman, it is good to see you in both committees. We will look forward to working with Congress, the appropriators on additional resources as I believe we will need that. We have not scaled it yet, but it is clear to us that we will need additional resources. And all I can commit to you is to work with this committee and the appropriators and the Agriculture Committee as the scope of this comes together over the next month or 6 weeks."
"Mr. Hu","There will be a material increase in resources that will be needed. Indeed, we at the SEC realize the need for expertise--real-world Wall Street expertise in terms of areas like credit derivatives and the like. And I personally have been involved in terms of recruitment efforts in that respect. And so with a wider jurisdiction over this previously unregulated market, there will be a corresponding increase in resources needed."
"Mr. Lucas","Just as the CFTC's primary focus are these issues all the time, I appreciate that greatly. I also realize that the Securities and Exchange Commission has a wide variety of responsibilities. Over the course of the last so many years, how many people have been committed at the SEC to doing this kind of work already within existing jurisdictions?"
"Mr. Hu","In terms of specific numbers of people, I am afraid I will have to get back to you. I could tell you that in terms of these derivatives-related activities, they cut across Divisions. For instance, the Division of Trading and Markets has been very concerned in terms of certain derivatives issues and the Division of Enforcement in terms of insider trading. The Division of Investment Management has been concerned with mutual funds investing in derivatives and the like--we are seriously concerned about that issue and have asked an ABA subcommittee to look at those kinds of issues. The creation of this new Division is in part a reflection of the need to adopt a more integrated approach to thinking about the benefits and the costs associated with the derivatives revolution."
"Mr. Lucas","The reason I ask those questions, of course, is it appears that we will have another opportunity to visit about this in the Agriculture Committee in a few days, perhaps a few weeks. So preparing information in regards to both, I look forward--because after all, we are not just talking about expanding authority for both agencies and compelling you to work together; we are also reviewing how efficiently you have used the resources and the responsibilities you have already had. That is a key, I think, measure that needs to be taken. With that, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from California."
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Hu, I want you to help me understand something about credit default swaps. From everything that I have learned, I came to the conclusion that they should be banned. So I am very pleased that the chairman has included language which would allow the CFTC and the SEC to ban abusive swaps, including credit default swaps. However, I am concerned with the problem of what I have come to know and I understand of empty creditors. And let me read an article to you that was recently in Financial Times. There have been a lot of articles on this. ``The relationship between Goldman Sachs and ailing commercial lender CIT provides further evidence of the dangers of the credit default swap market. Credit default swaps have become an increasingly contentious issue in debt restructuring, such as one that CIT is now trying to complete. Many creditors who hold such insurance make more if a company files for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection than they make on their debt if the company succeeds in restructuring its debt outside of bankruptcy. In the case of CIT, the market has bought more insurance than the company's $30 billion in debt. These holders include Goldman Sachs, which purchased such a credit protection to hedge against a June 2008 rescue financing of up to $3 billion to CIT, Goldman said. Goldman also held other CIT debt, although the company declined to comment on these other exposures.'' Now, we bailed out Goldman, and we bailed out AIG. We bailed out AIG to the tune of $100 billion, I believe. We--and it appears that they ended up paying Goldman about--I think about $13 billion. Now we see the CIT situation. How will the Commission be able to use this new authority to prevent empty creditors or lenders who are net short their own clients? Would the Commission need any additional statutory authority to address this problem, or does this bill provide you with enough tools to prevent empty creditors from triggering defaults and bankruptcies?"
"Mr. Hu","In the interest of full disclosure, I am afraid I am the one who came up with the term ``empty creditors.'' In particular, the Goldman situation--CIT situation you referred to might be of the ``empty creditor with a negative economic interest'' variety. This variety poses particularly difficult issues relating directly to your broader question in terms of this anti-abuse provision. This anti-abuse provision appears for the first time in this bill in this discussion draft. The SEC is right now just starting to analyze this particular provision. And your particular example of the Goldman Sachs/CIT situation illustrates some of the questions we are thinking about and we are working our way through. For instance, this anti-abuse provision talks about watching out for products that destabilize the system or an individual market participant and possibly banning them. What if it turns out that something--a particular kind of swap--is beneficial to the system in the sense of allowing banks, for instance, to hedge against risks or financial institutions to make loans and so forth, and yet perhaps be harmful to a particular market participant? The bill's provision doesn't answer that. It also raises issues--difficult issues that we are starting to analyze--as to what extent should some of the benefits flowing from a particular product be balanced against the potentially destabilizing effects of the products? Naturally, these issues raise profound questions that we are starting to look at, and we will be engaging in many consultations with other concerned regulatory agencies. But you raise a very, very good issue, Congresswoman Waters."
"Ms. Waters","I yield back. Thank you very much."
"Mr. Watt","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling."
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have no doubt that our derivatives market can be improved, made more competitive, made more transparent. But I usually ask myself a threshold question when proposals are put on the table, and that is, is the cure worse than the illness? I don't think we would be here today but for AIG. Again, I haven't convinced myself they weren't a symptom as opposed to a cause. But if you believe they are a cause, just to ensure what we are trying to protect against, are you gentlemen aware, were there other abuses in the derivatives market or other major economic players besides AIG that bring us here today?"
"Mr. Gensler","Absolutely, Congressman. Derivatives are an unregulated marketplace, and we believe that the dealers, whether it was the affiliates of Lehman Brothers, the affiliates of Bear Stearns, or even the affiliates of the institutions that made it through last year with the support of the government--taxpayers supported a lot of institutions last year--many institutions used derivatives, significantly leveraged up their exposures to risk, and it did it in a nontransparent way. So what we are here about discussing is how do we lower risk to the American public, not just in AIG's case, but lower risk to the American public and also address information deficits? The public knows--"
"Mr. Hensarling","I am sorry. Specifically, which companies do you view as abusing derivatives; and it was a derivative, or was it a problem with the underlying asset being residential real estate?"
"Mr. Gensler","Derivatives allow for risks to be managed, managed well. But also in the aggregate, particularly in the books of many financial institutions, it also allows risks to be accumulated and large leveraged to--"
"Mr. Hensarling","I understand that, but can you name specific companies?"
"Mr. Gensler","I believe that in--many financial institutions have used derivatives to take on significantly extra risk, and so we are saying we need to bring this into the capital regime as a cushion, whether it is any of the remaining 15 large--"
"Mr. Hensarling","Let me try asking a slightly different variation of the question. Are you aware, then, of any other major economic institution in the economy besides AIG that wrote credit default swaps without posting collateral to their counterparties?"
"Mr. Gensler","Yes."
"Mr. Hensarling","Who?"
"Mr. Gensler","We could go straight down the list of the large financial institutions, many of them that still exist today, and recall that of the first $90 billion that went into AIG, $60 billion went overseas to overseas institutions. It gives you a sense of how interconnected we are. The other $30 billion went to many of the other financial--"
"Mr. Hensarling","I understand that. That is the reason why many of us opposed that in the first place. We have had the head of OTS previously testify before this committee, that is the prudential regulator. They had the authority to rein in AIG's Financial Products Division with their credit default swaps. They simply missed it. They didn't lack the regulatory authority. Do either of you disagree with that testimony, which, by the way, was under oath?"
"Mr. Hu","Congressman, to this question you just asked as well as the previous question, one of the key aspects of AIG, and, in a sense, of the involvement of other financial institutions and credit default swaps, is the whole issue of interconnectedness. When markets panic, they sometimes can freeze up. And part of what caused the financial problem and caused the intervention with respect to AIG subsequent to Lehman was the notion that this interconnectedness was spreading, that people were suddenly refusing to deal with each other and so forth. By having these clearinghouse arrangements so that in effect people don't really have to depend on--"
"Mr. Hensarling","Forgive me for interrupting. I see my time is about to run out. With respect to interconnectedness, is it not possible that some type of mandatory clearing, is that not making us more interconnected? Is that not somehow centralizing the risk in one particular location? And if interconnectedness is a critical component of systemic risk, why aren't we arguing--"
"Mr. Gensler","It actually lowers risk, because right now the large swap dealers, there are about 15, maybe generously 20, around the globe are also in the banking business, they are in the securities business, they are in the insurance business, and the leasing business and proprietary trading business, and they are central counterparties. AIG was a central counterparty, not a regulated clearinghouse. What we are trying to do is we are trying to separate out of the large financial houses this counterparty function regulated. I would daresay if this committee--if somebody came here and said, could the large central counterparties today that are regulated go into the leasing business, go into the banking business, go into the insurance business, you would say, no, no, no, we want to keep that separate and make sure that function is regulated and has the discipline of a daily marking to market, a daily accounting, a daily settling up. It is a harsh discipline in a sense, but it works in the futures industry, the largest clearinghouse there. It works well. It works in the options on securities, which is called the Options Clearing Corporation. It works very well, and it is separated out from banking securities and so forth, obviously, with great benefit."
"Mr. Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. And I recognize myself for 5 minutes. Mr. Gensler, I am going to zero in on the part of your testimony on page 10 that deals with exchange trading. And I know that you and the Chair have had an exchange about this earlier, but I want to be clear on where this is likely to lead. It seems to me that the Administration's draft dealt with this, and the discussion draft that has been circulated by the chairman now muddies the water. Is that your assessment? That seems to be what you are saying on page 10."
"Mr. Gensler","The Administration bill, which I fully support, requires that those products that can be cleared also have the benefit of either trading platforms, execution facilities or exchanges, and that benefits all these end-users that we have been talking about earlier on the clearing issue."
"Mr. Watt","And that would be--under the Administration's bill, swap dealers and major swap participants would be required to do a certain set of things, and then everybody else would not be, or would everybody be required to--"
"Mr. Gensler","It requires all of the transactions that can be cleared and listed to be listed on these facilities. Now, some have raised the issue of what if there is not enough liquidity and so forth. And what we have recommended here in this testimony and look to work with this committee on is that through rulemaking the SEC and the CFTC, just as we do in futures and securities, would allow for certain block trading and certain transactions to happen, but still be less--"
"Mr. Watt","But legislation won't accommodate the rulemaking. You can't make a rule that is inconsistent with the legislation."
"Mr. Gensler","That is right. The discussion draft does not allow for this. The discussion draft goes from requiring exchange transparency to just making it optional."
"Mr. Watt","Now, the thing that I wasn't clear on when I read this was whether this--this appeared to me to be as potentially a drafting error as opposed to a conscious decision. I don't want to put you in the position of deciding whether that--is this something that can be fairly easily corrected?"
"Mr. Gensler","Absolutely. My compliments to the dedicated staff of this committee. This could very well just be an unintended consequence. But we think that, aligned with what President Obama and the heads of state laid out, that we should move towards the exchange and exchange venue transparency, get the benefits of the self-regulatory function, the trade affirmation function and all that goes on on these exchange and trading venues."
"Mr. Watt","So just changing it back to making it, at least for major swap dealers and major swap participants, mandatory, is there another category outside swap dealers and major swap participants for which it may be--there may be a different standard?"
"Mr. Gensler","There is a benefit to end-users. If I can tease out--the end-user issue on clearing, which is a very real issue and we are all grappling together on that about posting margin and capital and so forth, is different than on the exchange side. It is all about transparency. This truly does benefit every small utility company, every small user of derivatives to have greater transparency. The only party that would naturally be opposed is Wall Street because they right now have the information advantage, and that is natural."
"Mr. Watt","Talk to us about some of the advantages of greater transparency outside Wall Street. I understand that some people on Wall Street would like to have that kind of advantage, but what are some of the advantages to greater transparency outside?"
"Mr. Gensler","The advantages that economists for decades have noticed is that end-users then get the benefit of seeing that price discovery function. If you are a small hospital in any State, and you are thinking about hedging an interest rate risk, you can see what happened even a half an hour earlier on a standard interest rate hedging transaction."
"Mr. Watt","How does that compare, for example, with the kind of transparency that is currently available on a regular exchange?"
"Mr. Gensler","Well, it would be very close to the transparency that you would see on the regulated securities, exchanges and regulated trading venues. There is also these alternative trading venues in the securities and in the futures world."
"Mr. Watt","Thank you. My time has expired, and the gentleman Mr.--let me see who is next--Mr. Castle, I think, is next."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am impressed by the testimony of both of you and the work you have done on this, including this committee and the Agriculture Committee, which has been referenced. And I just want to get confirmation from you. I assume that you are--this is a positive question, not a negative question. You are working together with respect to the various recommendations which you are working on. I don't see a lot of space between you, and I would assume that is the case, and you are working jointly with this committee and the Agriculture Committee; you are not setting one off against the other is my assumption, based on what I am hearing."
"Mr. Gensler","I thank you for that, Representative Castle, and I believe that would be the case at the staff and Commission and Chair levels."
"Mr. Castle","Let me ask you this, Mr. Gensler. You mentioned earlier in your testimony the need for explicit capital standards. And I am not enough of an expert to perhaps even ask the right question, but I am worried about the liquidity in all of this. Capital is one thing, but sometimes there is capital without liquidity. Is that a factor that is taken into consideration, or am I not understanding it correctly in terms of the capital versus liquidity needs and trading circumstances?"
"Mr. Gensler","Liquidity is fundamental to markets and fundamental to all the users of these products. Capital is that the financial institutions that hold themselves out to the public as dealers have sufficient shock absorbers, so to speak, in their business. One of the key assumptions to regulation is that we were regulating the large financial institutions, and I truly believe the financial regulatory system failed the American public. So that is why we are recommending that it has to be more explicit in writing rules about the capital. These large financial institutions already were supposed to have capital for their derivatives business; not AIG, but the others, so to speak. We think that is just more transparent, go through the usual Administrative Procedures Act and have real explicit rules on the capital on these products."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you. Like everybody here, and I think you are addressing these issues, I obviously believe we need greater transparency and accountability of OTC derivatives, but there are--and we all know this--users out there who are concerned that implementing these reforms will limit the use of derivatives as a way to manage risk because margin capital requirements to participate in these deals may be too costly. And I think I am referring mostly to entities that use the trade and these various derivatives for business, or whatever it may be. So there is some legitimate concern about that. Have you addressed--have we addressed this in the legislation, and are you taking this into consideration as you comment on this?"
"Mr. Gensler","We are concerned that we get this right, the balance is right, and what we suggested is that the end-users be allowed to enter into their own individual credit arrangements with the financial institutions so that the financial institutions still bring the transactions to central clearing. However, if Congress doesn't accept that approach, we think that we would want to work with this committee and Congress just to make sure it is a very narrow exception for end-users that are non-financial institutions that are using swaps not--they are incidental to the business, and it is to hedge particular commercial risk. I should note this is only really a debate about the standard or clearable contracts, because all the end-users, appropriately the Administration, the CFTC support, should be able to enter into tailored or customized products for their particular risks."
"Mr. Hu","I should emphasize that one of the key ways we want to protect end-users is to make sure that the clearinghouses don't overcharge. So what we have done historically in terms of ensuring that is to, in fact, refuse to tie a particular exchange to a particular clearing service. So the result is that we have a single stock or a similar product trading across multiple exchanges cleared through one entity, and that has really redounded to the benefit of the investors. So this public utility model of clearinghouses, we think, is very important. A second aspect in terms of protecting end-users, I think, is that while central clearing and exchange trading are both worthy goals, worthy to think about in terms of improving transparency and the like, but in terms of making exchange trading mandatory, historically in terms of the securities laws, we don't require mandatory exchange trading. We have alternative trading systems to stock exchanges and the like, and study after study have shown they have made things more efficient for the investors."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California."
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We have had quite a number of regulators sit where you gentleman are. Now, every time I hear from regulators, they always want to regulate. They never want to abolish the actual activity that would eliminate the need for regulation. We have a $592 trillion over-the-counter derivatives industry. This makes all of Las Vegas seem like a single grain of sand. For the most part, as far as I can tell, most of these derivatives are just gambling contracts. There is no airline hedging against increases in fuel costs. There is just somebody who thinks they can make money that day by betting on airline fuel. The question--one of the reasons this casino grew so large is that those who are betting believed that if the individual casino got in trouble, the Federal Government would be there to bail them out with regard--there is substantial possibility of that. Those who bet at the Lehman Brothers casino were wrong; those who bet at the much larger AIG casino turned out to be right and haven't lost a penny. The question is can the over-the-counter derivatives industry work without an implicit possible--because we saw sometimes it is there, sometimes it is not--Federal guarantee? If, for example, Congress did not adopt section 1204 of the Treasury proposal and did not provide a mechanism by which the Federal Government could come in with hundreds of billions of dollars and bail out one of these casinos, what harm would there be to the economic institution and to over-the-counter derivatives industry?"
"Mr. Gensler","Congressman, if I--I apologize. If you can remind me of section 1204?"
"Mr. Sherman","Section 1204 is the mechanism by which the Executive Branch can lend unlimited amounts of money or make unlimited investments in any systemically important--which really means top 20--financial institution."
"Mr. Gensler","I thank you. We believe that it is really important to separate out this central counterparty function from these large financial institutions precisely for the reason that you just raised, that they are so large that there is this moral hazard issue of where is the government, what is the government's role in those institutions. So in separating them out, in central counterparties that are fully regulated and have to take an accounting on a daily basis, have to have collateral posted, and it is separated from a lending business, separated from an insurance or securities or proprietary trading business, we firmly believe that lowers--"
"Mr. Sherman","If we separate it out, do you have a system that will work without a section 1204, without an implicit Federal contingent guarantee?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think separated out, the central counterparties should be rigorously regulated and have to have the posting of that daily collateral."
"Mr. Sherman","Sir, I have a limited amount of time."
"Mr. Gensler","It might be better to avoid the moral hazard."
"The Chairman","The chairman yields--it is the Member's time."
"Mr. Sherman","Will your system work if Congress makes it clear that there is no implicit guarantee? Do you need that guarantee to make it work?"
"Mr. Gensler","On the central counterparties, I don't think so, sir."
"Mr. Sherman","So if we were to go with your system and prohibit or at least not provide for future Federal bailout, the system would still achieve its economic purpose?"
"Mr. Gensler","I am referring to just solely the central counterparty clearinghouses."
"Mr. Sherman","What about the rest of the over-the-counter derivatives industry? Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","The chances of needing this kind of emergency backup are so reduced with just fishbowl or a series of fishbowls that we are creating, simple activities that we look at--"
"Mr. Sherman","Mr. Hu, will it work without a code section that provides for this admittedly rare Federal bailout possibility?"
"Mr. Hu","That would call for analysis that we would have to do."
"Mr. Sherman","I look forward to your analysis. Thank you."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from New York, Mr. Meeks."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I want to commend you, Mr. Chairman, for trying to bring far greater clarity to many of the definitions of parties, instruments, and practices. I think the discussion draft brings back the focus to systemic risk, which I think is tremendously important. And, for example, I think the provision of a clear exemption from most of the new requirements for end-users and hedgers who use derivatives primarily for operational risk management. Though we need to be cautious about this, because we don't want to create all these loopholes, it is important, however, for us to be reasonable and responsible to require end-users who pose no systemic risk and who do the right thing by hedging business risks they don't control to be subject to the same capital or margin requirements as financial institutions and market makers who are, in fact, systemically significant institutions. Secondly, I think it was also important that we bring the focus back on proper capitalization and margining of trades by major players and by putting the responsibility of evaluating the appropriate level of capital and margin to a given market participant's functional regulator. Again, this brings the focus back to systemic risk by addressing issues of leverage and safety and soundness. And third, that other forms of collateral be held by independent third-party custodians, which is critical, I believe, in protecting the system from some critical abuses as identified in the past year. And lastly, how we deal with--and I have been talking about this a lot--international transactions, how they will be dealt with, and the criteria which--and a process by which certain international players may be excluded if they pose a systemic risk. However, there are still a few things that I think are out there that we need to--and I would like to get your opinions on this. I think we need more clarity. They include the degree of independence and competitiveness of clearinghouses which may be subject to natural monopolies, and which may have the power to skew the competitive playing field in their favor, particularly if they are predominantly owned by dealer banks. The other area of concern I think that we need to keep a close eye on, and I would like to get your opinion on that, is how our new regulations encourage continued innovation and competition in this space. Specifically, with new powers given to many regulators, particularly the SEC and the CFTC, it would be critical, I think, to hold them to a higher standard of efficiency and responsiveness. I would like to get your opinion on that."
"Mr. Gensler","If I may, we agree with the goal of promoting competition on exchanges, on trading venues and on clearinghouses. What we have proposed is: the clearinghouses be open and accept transactions from any of the exchange venues, and I believe that was included in the discussion draft that we have some technical things just to make it nondiscriminatory; second, that the clearinghouses be open in membership, that they allow some of the nonswap dealers in as long as they meet the membership requirements of these clearinghouses; and third, that the governance be opened, and that governance not just be controlled--as you suggest you would want to avoid as well-- controlled by the dealer community, to help promote competition. Working with this committee, we could also work on rules to make sure, as Mr. Hu said, that the clearinghouses couldn't just demand such charges for their central clearing because of the concerns you say they might naturally end up being single entities."
"Mr. Hu","Congressman, you raise excellent questions. The SEC has historically emphasized very much the public utility model as to clearinghouses so that we actually expect fair representation of people who use these clearinghouses so that there is active involvement in terms of making sure that the fees are not exorbitant, that they don't unfairly burden people. And we have set up this model to prevent exchanges from controlling clearinghouses. We believe that is an essential element as well. In terms of innovation, competition, the discussion draft Treasury proposal recognized both the benefits of financial innovation and some of the costs. And in terms of this balance, these are issues that the CFTC and the SEC, together with this committee and other committees, will work closely on."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California, Mr. Royce."
"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It appears that questions surrounding the idea of a central counterparty still remain, and one of those is the argument that some economists make, and it basically goes like this. They say by inserting this third party into the mix, you end up concentrating the credit risk, and, of course, you weaken the due diligence that would otherwise exist among the counterparties. The line of argument they make, and I would like to hear your response to this, is that while central counterparties do not have market risk, they do have the credit risk to their members. So it appears that the central counterparty idea presents a tradeoff between the benefits of economies of scale and the concentration of credit risk in the central counterparty. So the way it is portrayed by economists is the central counterparty would become systemically significant and thereby will be perceived probably as being ``too-big-to-fail.'' And if the central counterparties' capital and the additional capital it can raise by making capital calls on its members are insufficient to cover losses from defaulting members, then who will bail out the central counterparty? That becomes sort of the moral hazard problem that might result. Who is the lender of last resort, especially when you consider a multinational central counterparty? Do you think there is justification in that concern? Does that erode market discipline and due diligence? Do you think there is an argument there?"
"Mr. Gensler","Congressman, we currently have central counterparties that are called Wall Street financial institutions. Generally, there are about 15 around the globe. There are 5 major ones right now that are 80 to 90 percent of these markets. And they are not being regulated to lower risk as central counterparties, they are being regulated as banks and securities firms. So we think we need to separate out that which we can, put it into central clearinghouses that are regulated, only the product that can be cleared, that has enough liquidity, and then you get the benefit of lowering risk, because there is a daily accounting, there is a daily settling up where collateral is posted, and we truly actually are addressing the same issue those economists you referred to are trying to address, but trying to lower risk, because right now we have a very highly concentrated financial industry, but we are not regulating this activity separately."
"Mr. Royce","Yes, Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","I agree with those. In addition, one of the central points I want to emphasize is that these big derivatives dealers are engaged in a tremendously wide-ranging set of activities, everything from merchant banking to insurance to all manner of activities, much of which may not be transparent. With clearinghouses, in addition to these really tight controls, daily controls, you have a tightly limited set of activities. So it becomes much easier to make sure that they have the right capital and so forth. It is a much simpler regulatory task."
"Mr. Royce","Let me ask you the other half of that equation, because the other part of the concern with that is the weakening of due diligence among the members of a central counterparty. If by definition, the central counterparty then absorbs the counterparty risk of its members, will this structure encourage the outsourcing of due diligence by the members of the central counterparty? And I will give you an example. We saw with the rating agencies the outsourcing of due diligence, right, and the outsourcing to institutions that were perceived to have superior knowledge. And we saw that was a mistake which could result in unintended consequences. Do you think that humans could make the same error here in judgment?"
"Mr. Gensler","Humans definitely are prone to make similar errors, I concur with that. What this replaces it with is rather than another judgment on credit risk, it replaces it with the discipline of actually doing a daily accounting and a daily settling up with margin. So that is the replacement rather than just unsecured exposures."
"Mr. Hu","Two differences. One is that in contrast to merely doing due diligence in terms of other counterparties--that is, that one bank trying to figure out whether another bank is reliable, here we have government actually coming in and saying, you have to do ``X,'' ``Y,'' and ``Z.'' So it goes beyond just the screening, informational element. Very important. The second issue involves flipping it around. We are talking about reducing burdens to end-users and the like, those who use these products that are on clearinghouses. Flipping it around--if you have assurance that, in fact, the central clearinghouses worked, you don't need to spend money investigating."
"The Chairman","Thank you. The gentleman from Kansas. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Gensler, I know you are a proponent for mandatory exchange trading. There are benefits to exchange trading, but I have heard from some end-users, not Wall Street bankers, but a number of small businesses and even Kansas farmers who say custom derivatives provide a useful tool to hedge risks. I am also concerned about mandatory exchange tradings, a blunt instrument, when strong incentives can drive derivative trading to clearinghouses and exchanges. So at a time when credit remains tight and business activities restrained, Chairman Gensler, do you have any concern that mandatory exchange trading could slow the economic recovery underway? Let me ask one more thing, too. Might it have a negative impact on end-users that have used derivatives in a responsible way?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think it is a positive for end-users and a positive for this recovering economy, because it brings transparency and still allows, exactly as you said, the customized product--we are not talking about the customized product, but that which is standard in these markets, which, depending upon estimates, is between 50 and 80 percent of the market, still leaving a very large part of customization. But that 50 to 80 percent would be either on exchanges or on trading venues--people have different words for that--but alternative trading platforms, and then it would be very positive for the end-users to get that transparency and benefit. Even if it is a few basis points, it is large for the economy and for the end-users. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. Hu, what are your views on the potential effect of mandatory exchange trading, sir?"
"Mr. Hu","We differ slightly from Chairman Gensler as to the mandatory exchange trading as distinguished from the clearinghouse arrangements. We believe that clearinghouse arrangements will get you a lot of the transparency and other benefits associated with the two. And in terms of the burdens on end-users, we believe that the enhanced transparency and the standardization of a lot of these swaps that the end-users will be relying on may in some ways reduce costs, in some circumstances, for end-users. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. And, Mr. Hu, something to remember as we consider derivatives regulation is that we are not legislating in a vacuum, and this is part of a broader regulatory reform package. I believe there are some items related to municipal swaps that should clearly remain under the jurisdiction of the SEC in order to be covered by the increased protections for many securities and advisors that are coming out of the SEC and other parts of regulatory reform. But what are your thoughts on the unique nature of municipal finance that often require their contracts to be more customized?"
"Mr. Hu","In terms of how municipalities most directly relate to this bill and these customized products, I think it has been the area of business conduct. And so one of the areas that we think may be appropriate would be, in fact, enhancing the business conduct requirements with respect to less sophisticated participants, some of whom may be municipalities. We have real concerns about that. We have seen issues involving municipalities and their derivatives activities that concern us. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Mr. Chairman, I yield back."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California, Mr. Baca."
"Mr. Baca","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Gensler, when you testified before this committee in July, I addressed my concerns about the initial transfer of the standardized derivatives into the clearinghouse. There was a proposal that initially a few clearinghouses will compete to carry these products. I was concerned, however, that this may create a conflict of interest similar to what we have experienced in the credit rating agencies. The discussion draft now calls for the Federal regulators to determine whether these derivative products are standardized enough to go into the clearing mechanism. In your mind, would this change eliminate any possibility of conflict to exist, or are more safeguards needed?"
"Mr. Gensler","Congressman, I concur with you that we need to ensure that the clearinghouses, through that conflict, don't force things in that ought not be there, and there should be strong oversight of that process. Working with this committee, though, we look forward to making sure that the presumption still is if it can be cleared, it would be in the clearinghouse. But I think that we can get this right working with your staff."
"Mr. Baca","So this would eliminate some of the conflict of interest or not?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think that the regulator should have oversight with regard to it, but that on a first order, the clearinghouses should determine under their risk management guidelines which contracts are clearable. Also, we would not want the burden to go the other way, that we force something into a clearinghouse that they can't properly risk manage."
"Mr. Baca","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","One thing we appreciate about this discussion draft is the ability for the regulators to help determine what should be cleared or not. This way, there is greater likelihood that, in fact, the particular clearinghouse meets the needs of the end-users and other participants. It is a more regulated process rather than the automatic--the much more presumptive approach of the Treasury bill."
"Mr. Baca","Thank you. In continuation, the discussion draft proposes a joint rulemaking between the CFTC and the SEC, and, Mr. Hu, in your testimony, you expressed concerns over his proposal. Instead of referring to Congress to include definitions in the legislation, if the SEC and the CFTC officials are supposed to be experts in these matters, in regulating the abuse, wouldn't it be best interest to agree on definitions rather than Congress so this way you don't wash your hands? And can you comment on why you think this legislation is a better or more effective approach?"
"Mr. Hu","I think perhaps an illustration may be helpful in terms of answering this question. Right now, in terms of the world of security-based swaps, those based on broad-based swaps basically fall within the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's jurisdiction. The narrow-based securities-based swaps fall within the SEC's jurisdiction. In fact, in the real world, with clever hedge funds and others, you can use two different credit default swaps, or two different security-based swaps involving broad-based indices, to get very targeted exposure. So you might have a system where, in effect, one falls within securities law and pure securities law considerations apply. The other may deal with exactly the same kind of concerns and yet be subject to a wider range of perspectives. So you may end up with gaps between the two approaches. And this is one of the reasons why we think that close economic substitutes ought to be treated the same."
"Mr. Baca","Thank you. I yield back the balance of my time."
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Georgia, Mr. Scott."
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome to the committee. I first want to thank you, Chairman Frank, for listening to some of our concerns earlier on and responding in a very positive way with the new draft bill for the increased clearing flexibility for end-users and the situation regarding our foreign board of trade by linking them to U.S. contracts. I still remain somewhat concerned about not overregulating foreign boards of trade, and being wary that they could, and it might invite retaliation by foreign regulators. I think that is something we should keep our eye on. I certainly want to commend you for that and also for--I appreciate your concerns and your response by exempting end-users of derivatives from the clearing capital and margin requirements. But my understanding is that the bill still mandates capital requirements for non-financial dealers, which could very well drive non-bank dealers out of the over-the-counter derivative market and end up concentrating a tremendous amount of power in the hands of the large banks. So, Mr. Gensler, could you comment on that? Are you somewhat concerned about the concentration of over-the-counter swap dealer markets, and do you believe that we ought to be concerned here in Congress that some of the proposals like capital requirements for non- financial dealers will give large banks, which already control 90 percent of this market, even more power? Is that a healthy thing?"
"Mr. Gensler","I share the Congressman's view that there is a highly concentrated market here, and probably 5 or 10 years from now, it will be even more concentrated. This happens in the airline and other industries as well. But I do think on the non-bank dealers, people holding themselves out in dealing in these, that there is an appropriateness to have capital; that we don't want to have something outside the system. These are generally in the commodity swaps area, the oil and natural gas and commodity areas, and many of them have capital. It is not to be additional capital, what they currently have, but just to make sure they have a minimum amount of capital if they are holding themselves out and making markets in these commodity swaps or other swaps as a non-bank dealer."
"Mr. Scott","But are you worried that it may drive some of them out of the market, thereby lessening transparency?"
"Mr. Gensler","Our concern is overall to lower risk in the system and enhance transparency, to promote the competition that you, too, as well want. But we want to ensure that there then wouldn't be some regulatory arbitrage that a non-bank could have zero capital and all the banks have to have capital. So we do think it is appropriate to have some minimum amount of capital if you are holding yourself out to the public as a dealer. This is the dealers themselves. And that is generally only in, as I said, the energy commodity swaps."
"Mr. Scott","Yes, Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","In terms of your specific point about perhaps driving business abroad, one of the things that helps is the extensive financial coordination going on right now: the OTC Derivatives Regulators Forum, IOSCO--indeed, Chairman Schapiro is at an IOSCO meeting in Switzerland today--the Over-the- Counter Derivative Supervisors Group. And among the reforms that have been discussed are things like standardized clearing, encouraging trading on exchanges, a lot of the same kinds of things that are going on here. So the international coordination should help a lot."
"Mr. Scott","Going back to you for a minute, how would the CFTC plan to implement and structure capital requirements for non-financial dealers so that we do not create a bank- monopolized over-the-counter derivative market?"
"Mr. Gensler","Similar in some regards to what we do overseeing futures commissions merchants, we work with other prudential regulators to look at their capital regimes. Where they are regulated by somebody else, we generally have lower regimes at the CFTC than the Federal Reserve or the SEC. I would envision it would be very similar to that, and we would allow the capital they have in their business--it could be in oil and gas reserves, it could be elsewhere--but just at the minimum. It doesn't have to be liquid capital."
"Mr. Scott","I yield back. Thank you again, Mr. Chairman, for--"
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California, Mr. Campbell."
"Mr. Campbell","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will apologize in advance since I missed part of this hearing. If these questions have been asked, or some of this, I will apologize in advance. But if we talk about the standardized clearing and so forth, and then the custom products, which is what I am hearing you call them, either in your opinion or under the discussion draft, other than transparency, would there be any limitations to the creation of and marketing of customized products, either ones that we currently see or ones that haven't yet been developed?"
"Mr. Gensler","We believe that the legislation should cover all of the products, but allow for hedgers to hedge risk, and even if they are tailored in particular and customized, so that they would be able to innovate, and that is part of our important risk management in our economy."
"Mr. Campbell","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","The financial innovation process is critical not only for this country, but the financial services industry and the social wellbeing. This bill does not stop that; it controls it. It tries to confine it so that the externalities of these kind of activities are severely limited."
"Mr. Campbell","Let us get to that, because homogenizing derivative products is not an easy thing. Obviously, everyone even in the bond market you haven't been able to homogenize and make an exchange trade and so forth. How much would fit in this standardized? How much homogenization is there going to be? And is there, then, incentive for me to create products that do not homogenize, because even though there is transparency, there can be more margins in something that is outside of this--well, not exchange, but outside of this clearing than would be inside the clearing?"
"Mr. Gensler","Well, I was going to say it depends on the market today, but in the rates-based various estimates, close to 80 percent of the market is already standard in some regard. In the commodity and the credit default space, it is lower, but still probably 60 or 70 percent. These is anecdotal evidence of that. But we are not trying to homogenize the other 20 to 40 percent. There is no goal in the Administration proposal or in the discussion draft to do that."
"Mr. Hu","The standard process of modern financial innovation involves the OTC derivatives market as being the hothouse for financial innovation. The weird products basically appear there first, the newest products, and they migrate. They get standardized. So right now interest rate swaps are highly, highly commoditized. Back in the 1980's, hardly so. You sometimes still had to argue about documentation. There is a process."
"Mr. Campbell","Okay. So you are saying that 60 to 80 percent of the market today is naturally homogenized simply by the marketplace so that buyers and sellers, people on both sides of the hedge, understand what they are getting, they are used to it, etc., etc., and that they are naturally homogenized not by government action or whatever, and that there is no further homogenization--probably not a word--that either would need to be done or should be done by government or by you or by anybody?"
"Mr. Gensler","Not on the economic terms. There is a desire to have rulewriting for these two agencies in terms of the processing, the netting and the documentation, what I will call the back office terms, but not on the economic terms."
"Mr. Hu","The existence of these designated products, designated for clearing on these clearinghouses under the draft bill, under the discussion draft, makes it very transparent what standardized products are out there, and that with this kind of transparency, various end-users and others can determine, well, gee, do I really need a customized product, or will that standardized product get me 99 percent of the way there? Should I pay that extra markup that you referred to, Congressman?"
"Mr. Campbell","Right, right. But if I do want to have that customized product, I would be able to do that, and there would be some transparency to that, that doesn't currently exist, but I am not going to be limited."
"Mr. Gensler","That is correct. You would not be limited, and you would benefit by seeing where the standard product, the homogenized product, traded 10 or 20 minutes ago when you think about the particular risk you want to hedge."
"Mr. Campbell","And the clearinghouses themselves would be through how, through what--who operates clearinghouses?"
"Mr. Gensler","The clearinghouses would be private entities, but regulated by our two agencies and overseen for risk management."
"Mr. Campbell","How many of those do we think there would be?"
"Mr. Gensler","It is hard to determine. Right now, there are five or six that are trying to compete in this space, and whether that narrows down to be one here in the North American and one in Europe, by product or otherwise. We think it is important, though, that we get full access. If it ends up in Europe, that is all right, but do we get full access as we would think foreign regulators should have full access if it ends up in the United States."
"Mr. Hu","Right now, in terms of clearinghouses for credit default swaps, there have been three or four or five that exist, two or three of which are active."
"Mr. Campbell","Okay. My time has expired. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you both."
"The Chairman","By the way, that is a recess, not a vote, So we hope to be able to finish soon. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green. And then we will go to--I cannot accommodate non-members, I apologize. But this committee is too big, and we can't do it."
"Mr. Green",""
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for appearing. I thank the Administration for its guidance and leadership. And I would like to repeat some things that have been said, but probably say them slightly different. It seems to me that what we have is this: We have a stock market that is mostly regulated, I think you will agree. We have a swap market that is mostly unregulated, and they are at the end zones. And then in the middle, we have this twilight zone of ``swap stop'' or ``stop swap'' market that is somewhat regulated and somewhat unregulated, which is where AIG was in this sort of twilight zone of swap market and stock market. Is that a fair statement, Mr. Gensler?"
"Mr. Gensler","I don't wish to disagree with you, but I think--"
"Mr. Green","Please do."
"Mr. Gensler","AIG was largely in the ineffectively regulated, and the products that they were trading in, the products were not regulated at all."
"Mr. Green","So they had more of a swap market unregulated than they did the stock market that was regulated?"
"Mr. Gensler","That is correct."
"Mr. Green","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","It is a huge gap that this discussion draft helps address. How we get there is a matter that we are all going to work together on."
"Mr. Green","Exactly. And what this proposal seeks to do is deal with that unregulated swap market to a great extent. And in so doing, you have promulgated some rules that we have not had heretofore. One would be a proposal to deal with abusive and--products that would pose a threat, a systemic threat. And in so doing, you can go so far as to declare some products as unworthy of being products in the regulated market. Are all of these fair statements?"
"Mr. Hu","The anti-abuse provision that you refer to is something that we are just starting to analyze, but among the issues is this."
"Mr. Green","Exactly. Now, let me say this: One of the reasons why--there may be a multiplicity, but one of the reasons we are so concerned about this is because of the systemic risk that developed with AIG, and other companies as well, and it is really the systemic risk that we are trying to deal with. We, generally speaking, wouldn't be in this position, wouldn't be here today, if we had not had some systemic risk problems we had to deal with, and taxpayer dollars ultimately had to help us maintain the financial system. So this is why we are here. Now, with reference to products that create a risk that can be deemed systemic by virtue of being pervasive and by virtue of being so risky that they just don't fit well in a regulated market, are there any products at all that you can think of that would be so abusive or so systemically risky that you would not have them in this market?"
"Mr. Hu","In terms of that issue, we have not tried to look for particular products that--"
"Mr. Green","I understand. Let me share this with you: We talked with Chairman Bernanke recently and this question was posed to him, and I think his response was that he thought that no-doc loans just didn't have a place that was one that could be placed in a market, but no-doc loans were just not good. I am asking you because, if there are no products, no products that are so abusive and so systemically risky that we would want to--I don't want to say ``outlaw,'' but say that this is something we really shouldn't have, is this provision going to be effective?"
"Mr. Hu","Congresswoman Waters, earlier on, referred to the Goldman Sachs ``empty creditor with a negative economic interest'' situation."
"Mr. Green","Exactly."
"Mr. Hu","So that--and similarly in terms of Goldman Sachs-- was perhaps an empty creditor as to AIG. So in terms of the Goldman Sachs situation Congresswoman Waters was referring to, incentives may sometimes be created for creditors not to care about what happens to their borrowers."
"Mr. Green","Because my time is going to expire, let me go quickly to this. A part of the problem also was that many of these counterparties outsourcing their risk management to the rating agencies, because if it was a triple-A rating, which is what AIG had, they relied on that, rather than having their own internal risk management. Will this deal with that kind of circumstance wherein you can outsource your risk management to the rating agency?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think it will largely regulate the credit default swap area, which is at the heart of what you just said, because that outsourcing of ratings was also relying on these credit default swaps. So I do believe that the Administration proposal and the discussion draft brings that into regulation, and this last provision that you talked about would add to it."
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back. Mr. Moore of Kansas.  The Chair next recognizes the gentleman from California, Mr. Perlmutter."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Just a comment, and then I want to yield to Mr. Murphy from New York. The terminology, the nomenclature, how we describe these things, changes all the time from swaps to straddles to just different things. It is just different methods of calling how you hedge, how you risk, how you speculate, how you gamble. My goal here, in all of this, is that there not be a risk to the system; that you two have enough resources within your agencies to make sure that whoever is doing this trading has the capital if their bets go south. And really that is all I want to know, because I don't want--I am okay with people trading and trying to manage their risks and doing whatever, so long as it is over here in the corner and can't pull the whole system down; that there is clearing on a daily basis or there is posting on a daily basis, or so that you know what kind of leverage really exists in the market. So at any time, if you don't think you have the resources to manage this stuff, I would like you to just come to this committee ASAP. Otherwise, we are going to spend another $700 billion like we did last fall, and we can't have that. Just a statement. Now I want to yield to Mr. Murphy, who does understand all of the ins and outs. I am looking at the bigger picture. Now I am going to turn it over to him. I yield to Mr. Murphy from New York."
"Mr. Murphy","Thank you, Congressman. A question to you, Mr. Gensler, trying to understand the idea of requiring everything to be exchange traded or through a trade execution vehicle. I am not sure I can get my hands around this. So in the standard market that we are familiar with for fixed floating swaps, some company is going to borrow $10 million and they want to change it from fixed to floating, or vice versa, and they do that transaction with a swap dealer. They want it to start the day their loan is going to close, so it happens to be November 25th, and it is going to last for 10 years or 10 years and 3 months, so there is still some nuance to that. What does it mean to put that on an exchange? I am not sure I really understand, because there is not going to be a big market of 8 other guys who want a 10-year, $10 million fixed floating swap on November 28th. So what does that mean?"
"Mr. Gensler","Right. First, I want to say, Congressman, in view of the time, we are here today saying we don't have the authority and the resources we need--for the record, to make it clear. In terms of bringing it on into this central, transparent trading platform, we have some examples now. They are called exempt commercial markets. An organization called ICE does this in the energy space. And many--over 700 contracts are listed in oil and natural gas contracts. They are swaps. So it would mean they would be listed. In your example, a 10-year interest rate swap would be listed, and it would be quoted, and there would be some bids in office on a regular basis. We would write rules so that if the transaction that you just referred to was so illiquid or specific that, just like block trading today in the futures world and the securities world can be done off-exchange, but you would still get the benefit that you see some listed market on the standard product, the trade is affirmed through the trading platform and then reported. Just as in the futures world, it is within 5 minutes when it is an off-exchange or block trade. It is a little different over here. So we get the benefit of multiplicity and competition of trading venues. It is not all on a fully-regulated exchange. We get the benefit of some self-regulatory function even on the trading venues, trade affirmation, trade reporting; and, where possible, you also get some bids and offers on the standard product that you can see a picture of the marketplace."
"Mr. Murphy","So you would be reporting the trade even if you are not hitting the exact standard. What is the nuance if it is a 10-year trade versus a 10-year-and-2-month? Does that put it in the customized world, or does that still go through the kind of standard? Because everything else is standard and clearable, but yet it is not maybe going to hit something that is listed. I guess my sense is that is going to be most of the transactions, so I am trying to understand that."
"Mr. Gensler","No, actually most of the transactions in the interest rate product area are clearable."
"Mr. Murphy","Absolutely. But I think almost none of them would be exchange tradable in terms of volume or specificity based on what I have always seen in business when we put these trades on."
"Mr. Gensler","And I think we are suggesting a change of a model, that Wall Street dominates this and keeps it close hold, and that small companies or small municipalities can't see a picture of that marketplace. We say that we allow for that. We allow the current inter- dealer brokers, who would register as swap execution facilities. Others that don't even exist today would compete in this area, similar to my example of ICE Atlanta that has over 700 contracts in the energy market, and we would see real competition in this world and transparency for these individual products. But, again, I think it would be appropriate to write into statute that we can write rules for what I would call voice- brokered transactions off exchange. They still then would be brought and affirmed on the platform, reported on the platform. There would be some self-regulatory function of those platforms, as we have in our two regulatory regimes. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair would next recognize the gentleman from Minnesota, Mr. Ellison."
"Mr. Ellison","Well, I am glad we have Congressman Murphy here asking you guys, talking mano-a-mano, sort of. Let me ask this question. The new draft legislation requires dealers to report prices at 5:00 for derivatives not traded on an exchange or electronic platform. Do you think this requirement goes far enough in terms of promoting price transparency in the derivatives market?"
"Mr. Gensler","We think that it may be an unintended consequence, but there are some exceptions in foreign trading, and it leaves it as an optional. But we think we should bring some real-time reporting, hopefully maybe not end of day, but during the day as well. But we think it is the right goal, and we will work with committee staff on this."
"Mr. Ellison","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","Indeed, one of the areas we are looking at is regulators getting real-time information so that we can catch things very quickly."
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you. How does this approach differ from the Administration's bill, which would require all standardized derivatives to trade on an exchange or alternative swap execution platform?"
"Mr. Gensler","In one case, it is required. We are suggesting it be required and allow for some rule-writing for this voice- brokered or upstairs market. And in the discussion draft, it is optional. We would like to work with the committee to close those differences."
"Mr. Ellison","Do you prefer or have any thoughts on which would be better for the public?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think it is better for the public to have the additional protections of the markets, including the trading venues, that it is not always a fully regulated exchange. But I believe the Administration proposal brings greater transparency and protections to the public."
"Mr. Ellison","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","We think that clearinghouses could get you many, many of the benefits of exchange trading, so our views don't quite match up with the CFTC's."
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you. The draft bill provides an exemption for entities primarily using derivatives for hedging and risk-management purposes. However, as you know, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are also major end-users of derivatives which they use to hedge interest rates and other risks. Would the draft language potentially exempt Fannie and Freddie and their counterparts from submitting standardized contracts to central clearing?"
"Mr. Gensler","I believe that the discussion draft would exempt the Government-Sponsored Enterprises. I think this is probably an unintended consequence of the drafting around what are called major swap participants."
"Mr. Ellison","Do you think that is something that should be addressed?"
"Mr. Gensler","We believe it should be addressed, that such major swap participants should come under this regulatory regime."
"Mr. Ellison","Mr. Hu?"
"Mr. Hu","Yes, we believe it is important to have objective, somewhat narrower, verifiable standards in terms of what you mean, in terms of what you count as hedging in terms of this exclusion."
"Mr. Ellison","I have a question to follow that up, but before I do, let me ask you this: Chairman Gensler, you have indicated that any exemption should be limited to non-financial firms. Would that be an artificial distinction, given that some firms wear multiple hats?"
"Mr. Gensler","It is a very good question. But what we are trying to address is a very real issue that end-users have raised about hedging their risk and the posting of collateral. What we have suggested is that they be part of this. But if Congress decides not to have them be part of it, this is an alternative we recommend to address the many people in the real economy who are concerned about posting margin."
"Mr. Ellison","So what should we do about those firms that do have those multiple roles they play?"
"Mr. Gensler","I believe that they should be part of this regime. I recognize the Congress, in grappling with this very real issue of end-users, may adopt some end-user exemption from this. That is not our preferred approach or what I am recommending, but if the Congress does, we would look forward to working with you in trying to get this language narrowed so the exemption doesn't swallow the rule."
"Mr. Ellison","This is my last question. Hopefully, we can get in under the time. In addition to hedging and risk management--both are broad and subjective terms that can cover a wide range of transactions. Given that hedging and risk management are subject to different understandings by different people, different interests, should these terms be defined in the statute and how would you define them? What proposals would you have?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think it would be best not to have the risk management exception in there at all. We have had years grappling with this at the CFTC, and unfortunately, you can drive a lot through those words. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired. We should have done this earlier, but I ask unanimous consent for Scott Murphy, a noncommittee member, to participate. Without objection."
"Mr. Perlmutter","Objection. No, I withdraw my objection."
"The Chairman","Overruled. Next, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Foster. I will say, we have votes coming up. We will probably just have time for one more round of questions here. Then we are going to thank and excuse the first panel and the committee will be in recess for votes on the Floor, and then we will reconvene with the second panel right after votes. You are on, sir."
"Mr. Foster","It is my understanding that the major players in OTC derivatives reduced even their complex derivatives to algorithmic form for jamming into their risk evaluation computer programs. So my question is whether there is a potential benefit for having industry-wide standards for descriptions of even complex OTC derivatives, which would seem to address two concerns. One is that if this is the format in which the repositories received the description of the OTC derivatives, as well as the systemic risk regulator, that there might be a chance for the systemic risk regulator to have an analogous system where their computers would also net out the industry-wide exposure. It also might address Representative Murphy's questions about what it means to be an exchange for very complex derivatives; that what you do is, you have not a listing you can read in the newspaper, but you would have a listing of here are all the algorithmic definitions of all of these complex derivatives and what they have been selling for. So I was wondering if you think that is something that is happening already in the industry, or is there a useful role for government in enforcing that standardization?"
"Mr. Gensler","There is a natural tendency towards that naturalization of the defined terms. The discussion draft and the Administration proposal gives us rule-writing authority to set business conduct standards on processing, netting and, I broadly call it, back office. But I think you are right, Congressman, it can go a little further in terms of also how the computers match up so that the regulators and the trade repositories and the clearinghouses have a consistent format, both domestically and internationally is very critical."
"Mr. Foster","Okay. My second question is whether anyone has written down a draft, even a draft definition, of what is too complex to clear, or maybe a list of things: These are clearly too complex to clear, these are clearly clearable, and these are the gray area. Is there anyone who has just had the courage to write down an operational definition?"
"Mr. Gensler","I don't know if it has been written down, but conceptually it is why we think the clearinghouse should be the first place, if they can manage the risk, rather than a government agency pushing it upon them. But then the government agency should have a role to make sure that they are not so biased to take on risk that they shouldn't, or misprice them and so forth. Generally, it has to have some liquidity to it, that they can manage the risk if the counterparty fails and you can get out of the trade in a several-day timeframe, not a several- month timeframe work. That is the conceptual frame."
"Mr. Foster","But no one has even tried to define that?"
"Mr. Gensler","No, actually the international regulators have, and even we have, received futures clearing, which is a derivatives clearing. We have a very real set of standards in that regard."
"Mr. Foster","Okay. And lastly, do you have any comments on what the European Commission did regarding the credit default swaps based on European entities and requiring them to be cleared on an European clearinghouse? What is the end game on that?"
"Mr. Gensler","I was honored to be asked to speak before 400 people at the European Commission 2 weeks ago at the end of their consultation. And I spoke specifically on this and six other items and said, I think it would be a mistake to have a geographic mandate for clearing; that we should allow the clearinghouses, whether they be in Europe, the United States or Asia, that the international regulators have full and unfettered access, not shortchanged by bank secrecy laws, but full and unfettered access to the information you vigorously regulated. The largest swap clearinghouse right now is in London. That works for U.S. regulators, as long as we can regulate it and have full access."
"Mr. Foster","And you don't see problems down the line with the United States giving up information to any country that might want to see every trade that happened?"
"Mr. Gensler","No. I think we have to have work with those international regulators, the large ones, like the European Commission and the FSA in London and so forth. And we have very good working understandings with these international regulators."
"Mr. Foster","Thank you. I yield back. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. The Chair will finally recognize the gentleman from Connecticut, Mr. Himes."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for being here. Mr. Moore of Kansas. I will remind folks that as you finish here, votes are going to be called and this panel will be excused. Thank you very much."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you. I am gratified that there seems to be an alignment now around the notion of really clearing everything that we can and, hopefully, creating as much of a standardized universe as we can. This obviously imposes quite a bit of burden as a risk manager upon the clearinghouses, and I have a couple of questions and observations related to that. First, there is I think a danger associated with the fragmentation of clearinghouses, both here in the United States and internationally. I would like to ask you about that. But I would also like to ask the chairman for unanimous consent to submit for the record some testimony by the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation, which is just raising the question of whether there should be a central depository for this information that would be available to the regulators, if there is no objection. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. Himes","Secondly, I guess just an open question: Are you comfortable, gentleman, that you have--we heard your comment on resources, but the culture and the intellectual capability within your organizations to really peer deep into the clearinghouses, to form judgments on how they are doing as risk managers?"
"Mr. Gensler","First, I want to say it is really good to see you as a Congressman, because I should disclose we have worked with low-income housing issues at the Enterprise Foundation."
"Mr. Himes","Right, also under the jurisdiction of this committee."
"Mr. Gensler","I do think--one the things I found in coming to the CFTC is tremendous expertise. It is an agency that oversees risk management markets, derivatives markets and clearinghouses, multifaceted clearinghouses right now, and has tremendous expertise. But it is, unfortunately, sorely underresourced. For instance, we are only right now able to go into the Chicago Mercantile Exchange once every 3 years to check on certain rule enforcement, rather than on an annual basis. So it is a resource-constrained, but well-educated, well-dedicated staff."
"Mr. Hu","We also have wonderful staff, very hardworking. In addition, we are hiring new people precisely because we need to better understand the new capital markets, these products, the need to keep up. I am totally confident that with sufficient resources, we are going to be able to make sure--not only make sure that these clearinghouses survive, but make damn sure these clearinghouses survive."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you. Next, one of the concerns I have, and I am sure this is broadly shared, is, we do not want to set up a situation where there is a clear incentive for people who otherwise might use standardized contracts to, in fact, use tailored contracts, perhaps to escape some of the oversight or requirements of standardized clearing. In your review of this legislation and as you think about the rulemaking that comes subsequently, are you confident, based on what you see here, that we will not be creating an incentive to send people into a customized universe?"
"Mr. Gensler","I think there is some incentive to do that by Wall Street, who might want to have a little less transparency. I don't know that end-users would have that, but I do think it is there. The European Commission and the U.S. regulators have come together and think that there should probably be a little higher capital standard if things are less liquid, so that sort of guards against that, if they are truly less liquid and they are not in central clearing."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you. Actually, you anticipated my last question, which is the international dimension of this, European differences between the United States. Again, sort of based on what you see in the legislation and as you think about your institutions and your recent experience internationally, should we be mindful of the risk that there is a flight away from the better clearinghouses, perhaps, abroad?"
"Mr. Gensler","Absolutely. Capital and risk does not know geographic boundaries. It will go globally. I am very optimistic, working with the European Commission, that we can achieve a coordinated approach. But there are different cultures and different political systems. I believe they are making their next key announcement on this on October 20th, and so we should look at that very closely."
"Mr. Himes","Is there a risk that our efforts to see these instruments cleared--if the Europeans move more slowly than we do, is there a risk that we see, in fact, this clearing activity move offshore?"
"Mr. Gensler","Right now, there is some clearing offshore, but it is regulated. Even this swap clearinghouse I mentioned in London is regulated by the CFTC, and then there are some exemptive things that the SEC does. So I think that we can, through legislation in Congress, be able to regulate even if it is offshore. I would rather do it jointly with the Europeans. I think we can achieve that. Their time scale is probably into next year."
"Mr. Hu","The only thing I would care to add to those excellent comments is that we work perhaps especially closely with the FSA, and it has been a remarkable relationship. They have deep knowledge in this area."
"Mr. Himes","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. I want to thank the members of the panel for your testimony here today and for answering questions. The committee will stand in recess for votes on the Floor, and then we will reconvene with the second panel. We are in recess. "
"Ms. Bean","We have the requisite number of members, so this hearing will resume. We will begin with the testimony from Jon Hixson, director of Federal Government Relations, Cargill, Inc. "
"STATEMENT OF JON HIXSON, DIRECTOR, FEDERAL GOVERNMENT"," RELATIONS, CARGILL, INC. "
"Mr. Hixson","Thank you. My name is Jon Hixson, and I am director of Federal Government relations at Cargill. I want to thank you for the opportunity to testify today. Cargill is an international provider of food, agricultural, and risk-management products and services. As a merchandiser and processor of commodities, Cargill is an extensive end-user of derivatives on both regulated exchanges and in the OTC markets. Cargill's activity in offering risk-management products and services to commercial customers and producers in the agriculture and energy markets can be highlighted with the following OTC examples: We offer customized hedges to help bakeries manage price volatility of their flour so that their retail prices for baked goods can be as stable as possible for consumers and grocery stores; we issue critical hedges to help regional New England heating oil distributors manage price spikes and volatility on their purchases so that they can offer families stable prices throughout the winter season; and we offer customized hedges to help a restaurant chain maintain stable prices on their chicken so the company can offer consistent prices and value for their retail customers when selling chicken sandwiches. Chairman Frank's discussion draft is a positive step in addressing comprehensive market reforms of the OTC market. While we have some areas of concern, there are many well- supported elements included in this proposal. The discussion draft would improve transparency with dealer registration and audit trails, the proposal would create a regulated trade data repository and has a stronger focus on reducing systemic risk and more rigorous requirements for inter-dealer transactions. The bill also provides flexibility for end-users and traditional hedgers utilizing OTC risk-management products and clearly establishes regulatory authority to ban any swap deemed abusive. Cargill supports these provisions and appreciates the work of the chairman and other members of the committee in developing this discussion draft. The draft bill represents a significant improvement over many other proposals that, in our view, would overly restrict the use of OTC markets for hedging purposes. Our main concerns with the discussion draft relate to two areas of the legislation: first, the application of capital and margin requirements. The discussion draft gives regulators discretion in whether to impose margining requirements in traditional hedging and risk-management transactions. We appreciate this flexibility. However, we are concerned that, given recent regulatory statements and testimony, the imposition of mandatory margining for hedging transactions would still likely occur. This will make it very difficult, if not unlikely, that firms would be able to affordably and efficiently hedge their flour, heating oil, and chicken risks as described earlier. To ensure congressional intent, the legislation could include a list of factors and in a similar style as the provisions within the discussion draft that provide greater guidance on the clearing requirement. In addition, capital requirements should clearly recognize and reflect the risk- management processes utilized by dealers. When Cargill offers tailored risk-management products to our customers like the bakery hedge, we offset a substantial amount of that risk by taking positions on a regulated, centrally cleared exchange, margined for daily mark-to-market exposure. We also use margin agreements with most of our customers. These steps greatly reduce overall risks in the hedging transaction. Regulators should consider such prudent risk- management actions as they analyze and develop appropriate capital requirements to ensure that the charges are based on actual risk of loss. Regulators are also given much discretion in setting margin and capital requirements for non-bank dealers. The provisions often call for requirements as strict or stricter than those a prudential regulator would establish for a systemically significant financial institution. While we are very sensitive to the role played by a non- banking firm in last year's financial crisis, there should be some recognition that the bakery hedge, for example, did not cause systemic risks for the financial system. Excessive requirements on our segment will likely only result in less competition among dealers within the OTC segment. Surrogation of assets is our second area of concern. We are sympathetic to those who lost initial margin money last year and would like to work with others, including members of this committee, to address this issue. However, restrictions around variation margining will have the unintended consequence of curtailing sound business practices that would otherwise minimize the risks of a hedging transaction. We appreciate the opportunity to testify before the committee to offer examples of our use of OTC products in risk management and to highlight our areas of support and concern within the discussion draft. We look forward to working together as this legislation continues to develop. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. We are going to proceed to the next witness, Professor Rene Stulz, chair of banking and monetary economics at the Fisher College of Business at Ohio State University. "
"STATEMENT OF RENE M. STULZ, EVERETT D. REESE CHAIR OF BANKING AND MONETARY ECONOMICS, FISHER COLLEGE OF BUSINESS, THE OHIO STATE UNIVERSITY"," "
"Mr. Stulz","Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, I thank you for providing me this opportunity to discuss with you draft legislation concerning the over-the-counter derivatives market. I am testifying in my individual capacity as an economic expert in risk management and derivatives. I would like my whole written testimony to be incorporated in the record. In the time allocated to me, I want to focus on two points from that written testimony. First, the legislation should not erect obstacles to trading customized on illiquid derivatives in a way that would make it hard for firms to manage risk. Second, requiring clearing for some derivatives products could increase systemic risk, and it is important for the legislation to make sure that does not happen and that, instead, clearing be properly implemented to make the financial system safer. Let me start with an example of how the use of derivatives can create jobs. Consider a firm in Ohio that exports machinery and considers bidding on a contract to export to Italy where it will be paid in euros. The moment the exporter makes a bid in euros, it takes on currency risk. The euro would depreciate between the time that it is made and a decision is rendered in such a way that all the profits of the exporter are lost. Because of this possibility, the exporter may decide not to bid because the currency risk is too large. With currency options, the exporter could hedge against a possible depreciation of the euro and lock in the profit margin after hedging costs. Hence, because of derivatives, the exporter could decide that it can bid on the contract, in which case jobs would be created as a contract is awarded. In my example, the exporter would have to use the over-the- counter market to obtain the best hedge. The reason is straightforward: The contract would have to be tailored to the size of the bid and reference a date that a decision is made in order to be effective. Often customized and infrequently traded derivatives are the most useful derivatives to resolve specific risk-management problems for non-financial firms. Such derivatives can only be sold on the over-the-counter market, and clearing of such derivatives, if feasible at all, is uneconomical. It is important that the proposed legislation does not make it more difficult and expensive for end-users to obtain customized derivatives by imposing reporting, margin, disclosure, and business conduct requirements that make it unprofitable for financial institutions to sell such derivatives. An important concern from this perspective is the ability of regulators in the draft to impose margins on derivatives that are not cleared. With new or customized products, such a requirement is impractical and could essentially correspond to our regulatory preapproval process. Clearinghouses assume counterparty risk. As long as clearinghouses are well-capitalized and manage risks well, there is no material counterparty risk with clearinghouses. However, clearing is not a panacea. Failure of a clearinghouse could have a much more dramatic impact on the financial system than failure of a derivatives dealer. It is therefore critical that clearinghouses be properly capitalized and that margins be sufficient to ensure a low probability of loss in the event of default. The proposed legislation requires margins that cover risks in the ordinary course of business and requires the clearinghouse to hold capital that would cover the losses resulting from the failure of its largest participant. Neither requirement seems sufficient. The span margining system, which I understand to be industry best practice, is set up so that margins cover stress losses. This requirement should apply to over-the-counter clearinghouses generally. Further, the capital requirement should be such that a clearinghouse should still be able to operate properly if its largest member defaults. The capital requirement in the proposed draft does not appear sufficient for that purpose because such a default is likely to be correlated with other losses. Academic research has shown that clearing could increase systemic risk if there are too many clearinghouses. It is therefore important that legislation does not lead to a plethora of clearinghouses. With few clearinghouses, the collapse of any clearinghouse would have a substantial impact on the financial system. Therefore, with few clearinghouses, the risk management capabilities of each clearinghouse becomes critical to the stability of the financial system. Further is that with few clearinghouses, these clearinghouses will have some monopoly power, and they could abuse that power. It would be beneficial for the legislation to address explicitly the situation where a clearinghouse becomes a monopolist in clearing trades of a given type of derivative. Finally, there has to be clarity for market participants as to when regulators are going to be able to require that a type of derivative be cleared. To make such a requirement regulators should be asked to show conclusively that the systemic risk benefits of requiring clearing exceeds the cost associated with it. Thank you. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. And we are now going to go to Scott Sleyster, CFA, chief investment officer, domestic, for Prudential Financial. "
"STATEMENT OF SCOTT SLEYSTER, CFA, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, DOMESTIC, PRUDENTIAL FINANCIAL, ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LIFE INSURERS (ACLI)"," "
"Mr. Sleyster","Thank you. Members of the committee, my name is Scott Sleyster. I am the chief investment officer of Prudential Financial's U.S. operations, and I appear here today as a representative of the American Council of Life Insurers, also known as the ACLI. The ACLI is a national trade association of 340 member companies who serve as the leading providers of financial security and retirement products for both the individual and group insurance markets. Prudential Financial is a financial services leader, providing compelling asset growth and protection solutions for the ever-increasing retirement needs of individuals in businesses in the United States and abroad. I would like to thank the committee for its invitation to appear today and to present the ACLI's view on the new discussion draft of the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009. In my capacity as Prudential's CIO, I am responsible for asset liability management, a critical function at all life insurance companies. The business of selling life insurance policies and annuities contracts requires us to match our asset portfolios with those of our liabilities so that we have the future cash flows necessary to meet the long-term financial promises that we make to our policyholders. The protections we provide often cover an extensive time horizon that does not correspond neatly to available investments. OTC derivatives allow us to effectively tailor the payment streams of our assets to match those of our expected liabilities. Customized derivatives in particular help to stabilize prices and mitigate risk within our industry's annuity business. For example, Prudential and other life insurers offer annuity products with custom guarantees that protect against downside risks of the underlying equity exposures of our clients. Our ability to provide principal guarantees, which are often accompanied with minimum retirement income guarantees, collectively protected retirees and consumers from an estimated $230 billion in losses during the most recent equity market collapse. Given the critical role that OTC derivatives play in the life insurance industry's asset liability management, the ACLI would like to offer the following six observations regarding the discussion draft released last week. First, we applaud the discussion draft's call for comprehensive Federal regulation of over-the-counter derivative markets. The proper operation of these markets and continued availability of OTC products remains a top priority to ACLI members. We remain concerned, however, that the draft's current definition of ``swaps'' and ``security-based swaps'' could be misunderstood to include certain insurance products such as annuities with optionlike features, which we feel should be explicitly excluded. Second, we appreciate that the draft does not establish a hard distinction between so-called standardized and customized OTC derivatives. We agree that it makes sense for responsible agencies to develop rules governing which derivatives should be centrally clear and those that should remain OTC. Third, we thank the committee for the significant improvement in the draft's new definitions of ``major swap participant'' and ``major securities-based swap participant,'' which now exclude end-users employing OTC derivatives for nonspeculative reasons, such as hedging and risk management. State-regulated life insurers are required to limit our use of derivatives to nonspeculative activity, providing us comfort that we would fall outside of both definitions. This is in sharp contrast to AIG, whose Financial Products Division was an OTC derivative dealer functioning outside the limitations of a State-regulated insurance company. Fourth, we strongly agree with the draft's proposal that non-cash assets should be acceptable collateral for derivatives transactions. As the largest class of investors of debt of U.S. corporations, insurers frequently use corporate securities as collateral subject to appropriate haircuts. The provision of the draft may need further refinement if the intent is to be fully realized, and we would welcome the opportunity to work with the committee on this matter. Fifth, we do remain concerned that the draft bill adopts Treasury's recommendation that the CFTC and the SEC be stripped of their customary authority. Given the complexity of this legislation, coupled with the dynamic aspects of the insurance and derivatives markets, we believe that businesses and consumers will be best served if the CFTC and the SEC have the flexibility to deal with matters as they emerge in real time. Finally, the ACLI endorses proposals to bring greater transparency to the OTC derivatives markets through trade reporting and centralized clearing of standardized products. Likewise, we support efforts to regulate derivatives dealers to ensure sound and efficient markets prevail. We thank the committee for this opportunity to share our perspective, and I look forward to answering any questions you may have. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you very much. And now Mr. David Hall, chief operating officer of Chatham Financial Corp. "
"STATEMENT OF DAVID HALL, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, CHATHAM"," FINANCIAL CORP. "
"Mr. Hall","Good afternoon. It is an honor and a responsibility to participate in this hearing today. Thank you for inviting me to testify regarding the regulation of over- the-counter derivatives. To begin, it may be helpful to know the role of my firm in the OTC derivatives market. Chatham Financial is the largest independent advisor and service provider to businesses who use derivatives to reduce their interest rate and foreign currency risk. A global firm based in Pennsylvania, Chatham has over 1,000 end-user clients in 45 States, ranging from Fortune 100 companies to very small businesses. Chatham is employee-owned and independent. We do not accept compensation from dealer banks. We help our clients hedge risks, not speculate, and we do not advise on credit default swaps. Given the events in the financial markets in recent years, we applaud the Administration and Congress for considering appropriate changes to our financial regulatory system, including the area of derivatives. We believe we should all work to reduce the risk to our financial system should one of our largest banks, insurance companies, hedge funds or any other of our largest financial institutions fail. While prudent policy changes are needed to address the problems that gave rise to AIG's failure in credit default swaps and in other areas, policymakers need to be careful to ensure that such policies do not harm the many areas of the OTC market that are functioning well. OTC derivatives are very important tools for businesses to efficiently and effectively reduce risk. In fact, 94 percent of the 500 largest global companies and thousands of small businesses use derivatives to manage their business risks. The main issue at hand is reducing systemic risk. The business end-users who use derivatives to hedge do not create systemic risk; rather they use derivatives to reduce their business risks, which in turn reduces systemic risk. Therefore, especially since business end-users only make up 10 to 15 percent of the overall OTC market, we believe derivatives regulation should be directed at trading activity between systemically significant institutions. We are very pleased that Chairman Frank and his staff, Members, and others have developed this draft legislation which recognizes and differentiates business end-users from large financial institutions. Specifically, this draft focuses central clearing requirements on large market participants rather than on business end-users. Additionally, it precludes those who would use derivatives to prudently manage risk from being subject to high regulatory thresholds under the definition of major swap participants. We are grateful for the opportunity to offer our suggestions for how the draft bill can be improved following our five recommendations for improvement. Number one, margin. Any requirement for business end-users to cash collateralize hedging transactions would create an extraordinary and unnecessary drain on working capital. This draft appropriately recognizes this cash burden by excluding end-users from the clearing requirement. Similarly, we believe this draft should also recognize this cash burden by excluding end-users from any margin requirement. For trades with business end-users, we believe credit terms should be negotiated by the two parties. To illustrate this point a bank may choose to make a loan without collateral if the business is creditworthy; therefore, it is reasonable that a derivative should be allowed to be offered to a business end- user without margin if the business end-user is creditworthy. Number two, capital charges. This draft calls for higher capital charges for noncleared derivatives. We believe this draft should be clarified so that regulators are instructed to set capital charges based on historical predicted loss, not as a penalty to discourage the use of OTC derivatives. Three, systemic significance. This draft bill recognizes that systemically significant institutions should be subject to higher standards than those that cannot impose systemic risk. However, as currently written, it is possible that nonsystemically significant firms could be subject to the same regulatory burden that applies to large financial institutions. For example, community banks that utilize OTC derivatives to hedge their balance sheet risk and offer risk management products to their borrowers could be deemed swap dealers and be subject to the same reporting, clearing, and margining requirements. Removing the burden for smaller, nonsystemically significant swap dealers will encourage competition and reduce prices for business end-users. Number four, a major swap participant is largely defined by having a substantial net position, a term to be defined by regulators. We believe this term should either be defined by legislation, or, if it is not, we would like to see the intent be clear that this definition should target systemically significant institutions. Number five, exemptive relief. As we make these historic changes to regulate the OTC derivatives market, we cannot now foresee many of the consequences resulting from this regulation; therefore, we should grant regulators the authority to provide exemptive relief where they deem necessary. To conclude, even though we have identified several areas for proposed improvements, we want to be clear that we believe this draft is the most thoughtful proposal for regulation of the OTC derivatives market to date. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. And we are now going to go to Mr. James Hill, managing director of Morgan Stanley, on behalf of SIFMA. "
"STATEMENT OF JAMES J. HILL, MANAGING DIRECTOR, MORGAN STANLEY, ON BEHALF OF THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION (SIFMA)"," "
"Mr. Hill","Thank you. My name is James Hill. I am a managing director at Morgan Stanley, and I am appearing today on behalf of the securities association known as SIFMA. We appreciate your invitation to testify. There is much in the committee discussion draft that SIFMA and its members support, and we believe that it includes many significant improvements over the Administration's proposal relating to over-the-counter derivatives. We appreciate the thoughtful consideration that you and your committee colleagues, as well as your staff, have given to comments that industry participants have provided, in particular those of corporate end-users. I would like to express SIFMA's support for legislative proposals to ensure that systemically significant market participants are subject to comprehensive regulatory oversight. It was lack of meaningful regulation of AIG's derivatives affiliate that allowed poor business practices to lead to a situation in which the Federal Government had to invest tens of billions of dollars in order to avert what would have been a systemically significant business failure. The discussion draft would address this regulatory shortcoming by creating a legislative and regulatory framework that ensures such a lapse would not likely occur again. We also support measures that would improve regulatory transparency and thereby facilitate oversight of the derivatives markets and the activities of individual market participants. The discussion draft accomplishes this by requiring that swaps be submitted to a derivatives clearing organization or reporting to a swap repository. We do, however, have concerns about some of the particular provisions in the discussion draft. I will briefly describe several. Although the discussion draft generally excludes corporate end-users from the provisions that would require exchange trading or clearing of swap transactions, they would be covered by other provisions. For example, the discussion draft would authorize regulators to impose margin requirements on swaps in which one of the counterparties is a corporate end-user. We do not believe that counterparty credit exposure created through a swap transaction should be required to be collateralized when lending arrangements between the parties can be made on an unsecured basis. We believe the decision to require margin and the details of how it is handled should be left to an individual negotiation between the dealer and its end-user client. The provisions of the discussion draft regarding security- based swaps are another area of concern. The draft gives the SEC jurisdiction over these swaps in part by amending the Securities Act of 1933 to include them in the definition of ``security.'' This approach is expedient, but likely would have unintended consequences that would be difficult and time- consuming to resolve. This is because many of the concepts and requirements under Federal and State securities laws do not readily apply to securities-based swaps. A better approach to providing for SEC oversight and regulation of securities-based swaps would be to give the SEC broad authority to adopt regulations that are consistent with the regulatory framework for other swaps. This would enable the SEC to address unforeseen issues without contorting the existing Federal securities laws and regulations to accommodate instruments for which they were not designed. Finally, we have practical concerns about constraints on the SEC and the CFTC's exemptive authority and the Act's short implementation period. The legislation could well have unintended consequences, some of which may be adverse to the market and individual market participants. Rather than having to pass new legislation to address such consequences each time they arise, we believe it would be more practical to grant the CFTC and the SEC authority to create exemptions that are consistent with the purposes and intentions of the act. With respect to implementation, we note the Act's provisions generally would become effective 180 days after enactment. We don't believe this would give derivatives dealers and other market participants, as well as corporate end-users, sufficient time to comply with the Act's complex and far- reaching provisions. We believe the effective date should be no less than 1 year after the date of enactment. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that SIFMA and its members support legislation to address the weaknesses in the current regulatory framework for derivatives. The events of the past year have made clear that improvements are needed. However, the use of derivatives have become an integral part of our economy because they enable corporate end-users to effectively manage risk. As such, it is important that legislation intended to improve derivatives regulation and reduce systemic risk do not unnecessarily impair the usefulness of derivatives as an important risk management tool. Thank you. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you very much. We move to Mr. Stuart Kaswell, executive vice president and managing director, general counsel, of the Managed Funds Association. "
"STATEMENT OF STUART J. KASWELL, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT & MANAGING DIRECTOR, GENERAL COUNSEL, MANAGED FUNDS ASSOCIATION (MFA)"," "
"Mr. Kaswell","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. My name is Stuart Kaswell, and I am the executive vice president and general counsel of Managed Funds Association. MFA is the voice of the global alternative investment industry and is the primary advocate for sound business practices and industry growth for professionals in hedge funds, funds of funds and industry service providers. Our members provide liquidity and price discovery to markets, capital to allow companies to grow or improve their businesses, and sophisticated risk management to investors such as pensions to allow those pensions to meet their obligations to their beneficiaries. MFA appreciates the opportunity to provide its views on the Over-the-Counter Derivatives Markets Act of 2009. MFA's members are active participants in the OTC derivatives markets. As such, we have a strong interest in promoting the integrity and proper functioning of these markets and ensuring that there is no repetition of systemic events, like the collapse of AIG, which required Congress to use taxpayer funds to stabilize markets. Similarly, we wish to prevent another Lehman Brothers- like failure where a large portion of the money lost or tied up in bankruptcy belongs to Lehman customers, including swap customers who posted collateral on OTC swap positions. Both of these events raise significant counterparty and systemic risk concerns for our members and are why MFA is fully supportive of the goals of the committee's discussion draft. MFA appreciates and commends the committee on the DMA. We believe it takes an important step in the right direction and addresses outstanding concerns with respect to the OTC derivatives markets. Particularly, we support: one, reducing systemic risk through the use of central clearinghouses; two, reducing counterparty risk by segregating customer collateral; and three, clarifying the definition of a major swap participant. We would like to offer a few recommendations with respect to these three items. First, we believe that cleared OTC derivatives play an essential role in reducing systemic risk. It does so by reducing the interconnectedness that results from too much credit exposure flowing through a limited number of dealers. Clearing also increases regulatory transparency and market efficiency with respect to cleared products. Because of the benefits of central clearing, we would like to see the DMA go further in promoting the use of clearing organizations by dealers to clear standardized products through capital incentives. The DMA does create capital incentives to clear swaps, but we believe it should ensure that dealers actually use central clearing. We also suggest that end-users that post cash collateral should have access to central clearing either through direct participation in the clearing organization or through a swap dealer. Second, we believe that the DMA takes a number of important steps to address counterparty and systemic risk by first expressly requiring the segregation of collateral on cleared trades, and second by requiring that dealers offer customers the option to segregate collateral for customized contracts. Requiring a clearing organization to segregate customer collateral will protect customer assets and make it possible to transfer swaps out of a failing dealer and into a stable dealer, which should diminish financial contagion in a crisis. With respect to customized swaps, MFA members, as end- users, post collateral with swap dealers as a safeguard for the dealer against customer failure. Currently, dealers are free to use this collateral as their own property. In the event of a dealer default, such as Lehman, customers are at risk of losing their collateral because it is not segregated from the dealer's proprietary assets. We believe the DMA goes a long way in protecting customers by requiring dealers to make segregation of collateral available to their customers; however, we are concerned that Congress' intent in protecting end-users from a dealer failure may not be realized unless Congress makes corresponding changes to the bankruptcy laws, including those applicable to banks that act as swap dealers. Third, we understand that the major swap participant category is meant to prevent a repetition of the AIG meltdown-- entities with a substantial net position. We recommend that the committee provide clarity to the term ``substantial net position.'' The DMA should direct the SEC and the CFTC, in defining the term, to consider the following factors: One, the relative net position of swap dealers, for example, a substantial net position should be measured with respect to the net position of swap dealers; two, a participant's average net position over a relative period, such as a year; three, whether a participant's counterparties have a substantial unsecured credit exposure to such participant from outstanding swaps; four, whether the participant holds assets belonging to retail customers; and five, whether the participant is an existing registrant with either the SEC or the CFTC. These steps could help prevent a repetition of future failures like those witnessed at AIG and Lehman. My written statement provides additional recommendations for the ways we believe the committee draft could be strengthened consistent with its important objectives. For example, we suggest changes to the portions of the DMA that address position limits and reporting. Thank you for the opportunity to testify. I would be happy to answer questions. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. We are now going to move to Mr. Steven Holmes, director of treasury operations, Deere & Company. "
"STATEMENT OF STEVEN A. HOLMES, DIRECTOR OF TREASURY OPERATIONS, DEERE & COMPANY"," "
"Mr. Holmes","Madam Chairwoman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee, my name is Steven Holmes, and I am the director of treasury operations for Deere & Company, also known as John Deere. Thank you for inviting me today to testify at this hearing on reform of the over-the-counter derivatives market. I am here today in my capacity as an executive of Deere & Company. My testimony reflects the views of Deere and the views of the Business Roundtable, of which we are a member, and which represents leading companies with more than $5 trillion in revenues and more than 10 million employees. Deere is a major U.S. company with significant overseas sales. We raise capital, manufacture products, and sell in the United States and in foreign markets. These international activities subject us to economic risk. To manage these risks, we use derivatives. We do not use them as speculative investments, but instead to convert transactions that carry inherent risk into ones that produce predictable cash flows. This enables us to offer competitively priced products and financing to our customers. Let me give you an example of how we use foreign exchange derivatives to manage currency risk. Australian farmers are important producers of agricultural commodities. Deere has sales and credit operations in Australia, but no manufacturing. The products we sell there are manufactured mostly in the United States and Europe. Australian farmers place orders for equipment well in advance of the use season to ensure they will be ready for the spring planting or fall harvest. There is a significant lead time to manufacture a tractor to the farmer's specifications and ship it to Australia. Since our sales are in Australian dollars and our manufacturing costs are in U.S. dollars and euros, we are exposed to exchange rate risk. Without hedging this exposure with derivatives, we would not be able to offer a reasonable fixed price to the Australian farmer, and we would lose sales. Let me provide one more example, this time of how we use interest rate swaps. We provide financing for our customers on a significant percentage of our sales. We offer both fixed- and variable-rate financing to meet the various long- and short- term needs of our customers. Derivatives enable us to match the interest rate characteristics of the funding available in the capital markets with our customers' requirements. This was especially critical during the credit crisis as capital was scarce. John Deere's volume of new loans increased during the credit crisis as we stepped in to replace other financial institutions that curtailed lending. We were able to issue long-term, fixed-rate debt and use interest rate swaps to match the shorter-term fixed and floating loans our customers required. Many investment-grade companies like Deere have debt covenants that prohibit the posting of collateral for derivatives. If existing derivative contracts are not permitted a grandfather exemption from the clearing and collateral requirements of the regulations, we will have to terminate these transactions at significant cost. Your bill takes key steps that accommodate the needs of derivative end-users like Deere. For example, your bill recognizes that many companies use derivatives for prudent risk management purposes. Your bill does not rely on clearinghouses to determine which transactions are accepted from central clearing. And your bill does not prohibit the use of non-cash assets to satisfy margin requirements. At the same time, we have concerns about the derivatives legislation that the committee plans to consider next week. I would offer the following three observations. First, we are concerned that regulators will be ceded too much authority to determine which companies are subject to higher regulatory thresholds and higher margin requirements. Second, we are concerned about the capital requirements for noncentrally cleared transactions. We believe that capital charges should be levied solely based on risk of loss and not as a means of forcing companies to centrally clear transactions. And finally, while your bill does not rely on a hedge accounting definition to determine which end-users are major market participants, we are concerned by the bill's open-ended definition of ``substantial net position,'' which creates uncertainty and again gives the regulators too much authority to determine which end-users are covered. Deere & Company is committed to working with this committee, the Administration, and other congressional bodies to enact thoughtful derivatives regulation that facilitates, not hinders, well-functioning capital markets. At the same time, the regulation should not be a disincentive to companies to enter into prudent hedging transactions. Thank you, and I am happy to respond to any questions you might have. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. And now, we will hear from Christopher Ferreri, managing director of ICAP, on behalf of the Wholesale Markets Brokers Association. "
"STATEMENT OF CHRISTOPHER FERRERI, MANAGING DIRECTOR, ICAP, ON BEHALF OF THE WHOLESALE MARKETS BROKERS ASSOCIATION"," "
"Mr. Ferreri","Madam Chairwoman, members of the committee, thank you for inviting me to testify today on the reform of the over-the-counter derivatives market. My name is Chris Ferreri, and I am testifying today in my capacity as chairman of the Wholesale Markets Brokers Association, Americas, an independent industry body representing the largest wholesale and interdealer brokers operating in the North American markets across a broad range of financial products. I am also managing director at ICAP, one of the founding member firms of the WMBA. Interdealer brokers serve as intermediaries for broker- dealers and other financial institutions that facilitate access to a full range of OTC and exchange-traded products and their associated derivatives forms. For relevant markets interdealer brokers are registered broker-dealers and are regulated by numerous agencies, including the SEC, the Federal Reserve, and the CFTC. It is estimated that each day, IDBs handle on average 2 million OTC trades globally, corresponding to about $5 trillion in notional amounts across the range of FX securities, interest rate, credit, equity and commodity asset classes in both cash and derivative form. Mr. Chairman, the WMBA is supportive of the efforts to more effectively oversee the OTC markets for derivative financial products. We believe that our current practices will integrate smoothly with many of the requirements in the discussion draft as well as the Treasury Department's proposal. We support the efforts taken thus far by the Administration and Congress to broaden the roles of the CFTC and the SEC in increasing the safety and soundness of the OTC markets. Today, we would like to focus on two particular issues: the characteristics and responsibilities of the swap execution facilities; and the protection of open, neutral, and nondiscriminatory access to central clearing. It is clear that the interdealer brokers would currently fulfill many of the criteria of the swap execution facilities described under the draft legislation or the alternative swap execution facilities under the Treasury Department's proposal. Much of what is contemplated for these facilities is already well within the capabilities of our member firms. Our technology-based reporting systems can provide the relevant regulators with real-time trading information. The WMBA is concerned with the requirement that swap execution facilities must undertake certain SRO enforcement- type responsibilities, including discretionary supervision and approval of particular swap contracts as suitable for trading and the general oversight of the trading activities of our customers. This is not to diminish the capabilities we currently possess to monitor for suspicious or manipulative trading activity and to report such activity to regulators. This is consistent with our concerns about the requirements set forth in the Treasury Department's proposed legislation for alternative swap execution facilities to adopt position limitations or position accountability for our customers. We therefore appreciate the committee not including such a provision in the chairman's discussion draft, recognizing that each WMBA member firm can only monitor the activities taking place within its own execution facility. Multiple and competitive execution platforms have demonstrated their ability to create efficient, liquid and innovative markets. Yet with the expansion and requirement of central clearing, there is serious risk that central clearinghouses will create, modify, and ultimately favor their own execution facilities over competing execution facilities by access fees, access technologies or cross-subsidization of execution and clearing fees. The WMBA would respectfully ask that you consider whether this is sufficient to promote and protect competition among execution platforms. As the Justice Department observed in a 2008 comment letter to the Treasury Department, a vertically integrated derivatives market, where a central counterparty providing clearing services also provides trade execution services, will limit competition, increase costs, and ultimately hurt end-users and larger market participants. One only needs to look at the securities and options markets compared to the futures markets. The WMBA is encouraged that this is consistent with CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler, who remarked at a House Agriculture Committee several weeks ago that, ``A clearinghouse should not be vertically integrated in such a way with an exchange or trading platform so that the only product they accept is from that exchange or trading platform.'' Frankly, if the clearing entity also provides execution services, there is not only an opportunity, but also an incentive for them to structure their services to squeeze out competition. The WMBA would ask that the legislation include language to protect against such behavior. In closing, Madam Chairwoman, we congratulate you on your work on the discussion draft and the Treasury Department's proposed legislation. The WMBA looks forward to working with you to achieve these goals. Thank you for the invitation to participate in today's hearing. "
"Ms. Bean","Thank you for your testimony. And our final witness is Rob Johnson, director of economic policy for the Roosevelt Institute in New York, on behalf of Americans for Financial Reform. "
"STATEMENT OF ROB JOHNSON, DIRECTOR OF ECONOMIC POLICY FOR THE ROOSEVELT INSTITUTE IN NEW YORK, ON BEHALF OF AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM"," "
"Mr. Johnson","Thank you, Congresswoman Bean, Chairman Frank, Ranking Member Bachus, and other members of the committee for including me here in your proceedings regarding derivatives reform. First off, when I worked in the Senate Banking Committee years ago, the derivatives regulation was solely the province of the Agriculture Committee. But I believe in the current circumstance where derivatives regulation is really the centerpiece of financial reform, and that is because of the current market structure, I want to applaud you for undertaking this endeavor, because I believe in the challenge that you face following the crisis, this is the essential ingredient to restoring confidence in our financial system. The upshot is that we have roughly five large financial intermediaries: Goldman Sachs; Morgan Stanley; Citibank; JPMorgan Chase; and Bank of America. About 95 percent of the derivatives activity undertaken by the largest 25 bank holding companies, according to the Comptroller of the Currency, takes place within the walls of those five firms, who are very likely to be categorized as Category 1 or ``too-big-to-fail'' firms. Ninety percent of their activities, according to the OCC, are OTC derivatives. Bloomberg and others have estimated that this year, those 5 firms will make roughly $35 billion in the OTC derivatives market. The reason I feel this is the centerpiece of reform is the ``too-big-to-fail'' policy is eminently intertwined with derivatives reform. The American public is quite demoralized by what we might call the induced forbearance of the bailouts that we experienced last fall. And I know one other dimension that the financial committees are working on has to do with resolution powers so that financial services holding companies, insurance companies, and others can, in fact, undergo prompt corrective action, as the FDIC could do with a bank now. But in a world where the opaque and deeply intertwined and entangled derivative exposures are present, it is very, very difficult for me to imagine someone like Secretary Geithner or Lawrence Summers considering anything other than forbearance when these entanglements are present, because it is unknown; it is like sailing in the fog. You could really hit the rocks if you decide to resolve these institutions, yet the discipline of market capitalism requires that insolvent institutions be restructured and resolved not just in the financial sector, but across the entire spectrum. The concern that I have is also that markets understand when things are too difficult to fail and unwind, and creditors of those firms, the people who hold the bonds, will actually diminish the amount they charge when they know that the firm can't go bankrupt; the so-called default risk will be diminished. What that does is it creates a very nasty feedback, because these large firms get a funding cost advantage, and they can drive competitors out of the market and increase their market share by virtue of being too complex and entangled to be able to bankrupt. And I think that is very distorting for our capital markets. One goal, therefore, of policy, and as we come back to your particular work on derivatives, is to figure out ways to contribute to ending this ``too-difficult-to-fail-or-unwind'' regime. When we look back at the market crisis, two things really occurred that I thought were quite prominent. One was what you might call discontinuous pricing. When you had opaque or complex instruments that were not readily traded, and margin or capital and pricing were not readily measured, it set up the system for violent discontinuities in price. People talk about many things that were carried on the books, particularly collateralized debt obligations, being in the neighborhood of 100 cents on the dollar and then instantly 20 cents on the dollar. What this tends to do when it is opaque and when many large institutions are intertwined is it makes them afraid of each other, it makes them very, very anxious, and that compounds the fear and the breakdown of the capital markets."
"Ms. Bean","I am going to have to ask you to wrap up, because we are running out of time."
"Mr. Johnson","So when I hear the testimony today that are largely two financial institutions and end-users, I believe that I represent a third group that comes to the table, which is the taxpayers, the working people of the United States. And while I expect if you put a proper structure in place in the derivatives markets, it will impose burden or cost at the margin, because we have had too much incentive for private risk-taking relative to public risk-taking--"
"Ms. Bean","I do need a final comment."
"Mr. Johnson","What I will do, I was just called to this hearing last night, so I will provide detailed comments on your bill and a statement for the record that will finish my comments. Thank you for including me."
"Ms. Bean","All right. Thank you for your testimony. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes to begin questions. First, I would like to thank Chairman Frank for working with myself, and with the gentleman from New York, Mr. McMahon, permitting the new Democrats on the task force who have been studying derivatives and initiated a number of the ideas that were ultimately incorporated into the draft bill that we are discussing today. My first question for Professor Stulz would be with the emphasis towards mandatory clearing, what is your expectation that the clearinghouses can handle the additional capacity?"
"Mr. Stulz","My expectation is that with proper regulation of the clearinghouses, they should be able to handle the capacity. The worry is that it will be an operational challenge for them, and that the regulatory authorities will have to be monitoring their ability to do so very carefully. I am not sure that the current draft gives them enough power to do so, and I think it will be helpful for them to have those powers."
"Ms. Bean","Thank you. I also have a question for Mr. Kaswell. A company stock price can be responsive to changes in CDS spreads for their company. There have been allegations that some market participants bought CDS credit protection, and at the same time took large short positions of the same referenced company stock with the intent of increasing the cost of credit to and credit risk of the company, ultimately causing the stock to fall significantly. Congress is exploring how to root out that type of manipulative and predatory behavior. Is it workable to ban short sales of a company stock when one is simultaneously purchasing CDS on the same referenced entity, or do you have some better ideas about deterring predatory or manipulative practices?"
"Mr. Kaswell","Thank you for that question. I think that it is important to think about the CDS market in conjunction with bankruptcy. As far as anybody has been able to show, we think that when companies have failed, they failed on the merits; that companies went out of business because their fundamental business model was not working in the economy, and therefore we think that to suggest that the CDS somehow was related to that, I don't think that there is evidence to demonstrate that. We think that CDS performs important functions in the economy. It helps provide an indication as to the value of the company. The price of CDS, I think, is a better indication than rating agencies, for example. It provides liquidity to market participants, and it also helps with the ability to hedge. And so we think that the benefits of CDS are important, and we don't see evidence that the bankruptcy scenario that you have described actually can occur."
"Ms. Bean","Also for Mr. Kaswell, does the draft legislation provide an effective medium to resolve the differences between the SEC and the CFTC?"
"Mr. Kaswell","I think it is a good start. I think that there has always been a tension between these two agencies. We operate in multiple markets. A product may fall on one side or the other legally, but as an economic matter, these products are often traded together with different trading strategies. So I think it is critical that if there is a joint regulatory responsibility, that there be joint rulemaking, joint interpretation. I think in some instances, interpretation can be as critical as the rulemaking itself, and I know that it can be a cumbersome process, but we think that the bill is a step in the right direction."
"Ms. Bean","I had a question for Mr. Hall. Do you think corporate end-users contributed to systemic risk in the economy at all?"
"Mr. Hall","I think my simple answer to that is no. Business end-users use derivatives to manage risk. They reduce their business risks, which reduces the likelihood that they will fail. And to the extent that any failure of a business would contribute to systemic risk, on a small scale, a business failing is tragic for that business and maybe for its customers, but it does not create systemic risk."
"Ms. Bean","Mr. Holmes, would you concur?"
"Mr. Holmes","Yes, I would concur. In the cases where companies are using derivatives to hedge when the derivative reaches maturity, there is an offset in cash flow. For a liability position, we have a cash flow coming in to settle that position. Actually, what could be a problem is if the company has to come up with cash in advance of the termination date, which would happen if collateral was required to be posted, and that can create a liquidity event for firms that aren't able to access the capital markets and raise the margin."
"Ms. Bean","Thank you. My time has expired, so I will recognize Mr. Bachus."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. I received testimony from all of the witnesses except, Mr. Johnson, I didn't receive yours. You worked in the Senate prior to--"
"Mr. Johnson","I worked for Senator Pete Domenici of the Senate Budget Committee when they were in the Majority until 1986. And then I worked with Senator William Proxmire when he was in the Majority in 1987 and 1988 on the Senate Banking Committee."
"Mr. Bachus","Now, you testified at the request of the White House; are you aware of that?"
"Mr. Johnson","No, I am not. All I am aware of is that the committee members called me last night at 6:00 and asked me if I could join this panel today. So I am not aware of what the inspiration was."
"Mr. Bachus","The White House requested you testify, which is fine. I didn't know if you had--have you looked at the White House proposal as opposed to the chairman's draft?"
"Mr. Johnson","Yes, I have looked at the White House proposal in great detail. I have only looked at Chairman Frank's proposal in a cursory manner this morning."
"Mr. Bachus","The White House proposal, there has been a lot of testimony from these witnesses that the White House proposal as it was offered would have actually made things a lot worse, I think is maybe a characterization I would use from some of the witnesses, not all. Do you agree?"
"Mr. Johnson","No I don't. Well, let me say I do and I don't. If forced to choose between the current discussion draft and the White House proposal, I would still prefer the White House proposal, but I can understand why the gentlemen on this panel with me who are describing primarily the impact on them rather than the overall impact on the market system--"
"Mr. Bachus","Well, Cargill, Deere, manufacturers, all sorts of companies in transportation, it would increase their cost. You understand that?"
"Mr. Johnson","I do understand that, and I believe that is accurate; it would increase the cost."
"Mr. Bachus","That being accurate, if it increased it substantially, they would either have to lay employees off, or charge more for their products or take actions like that, right?"
"Mr. Johnson","Yes. But I think that has to be put into balance with the costs that we have incurred because we have had a malfunctioning capital market."
"Mr. Bachus","Also, it would also reduce profits, which would reduce government revenues, which would put us further behind. So there are some real downsides to the proposal. But you are saying there is an upside, too. And the upside is that, what, we would avoid an AIG?"
"Mr. Johnson","I believe by creating more discipline in the derivatives market in terms of pricing and margining, we would improve confidence, diminish volatility in many of those markets as well as other market segments, and we would also bail out fewer banks."
"Mr. Bachus","We didn't really have any problem with commodity derivatives. What we had problems with was basically the subprime market, that it was junk, and they put junk in derivatives, and if you put junk in, then the derivative is junk. And so if you regulate, if you put rules which the Congress has on subprime loans, and you--we have regulations on underwriting, and we had unregulated subprime lenders, but if we regulate those, and we try to have some credit-rating reform, and we have had subprime lending reform, that wouldn't be repeated hopefully, would it?"
"Mr. Johnson","I would agree with you that those reforms would be helpful and meaningful and that they were the triggering episode, but I believe that the opacity of the large intertwined markets which included a lot of derivative exposures added to the fear and the depth and the severity of the downturn. Another trigger could cause that."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. I appreciate that. Mr. Hixson and Mr. Holmes, would you tell me if this bill passed as the President constituted and maybe as if it passed as proposed by the White House, what would be the effect on Deere and Cargill as far as your costs? And I am sure that-- what is your best estimate?"
"Mr. Holmes","It would be fairly material. It would affect us in a couple of ways. Our credit operations has the largest share of our derivatives outstanding, roughly $18 billion of derivatives, which sounds like a large number, but in the context of the loans we make to customers in excess of $20 billion, it is reasonable. Many of those derivatives we would not be able to execute under the proposal, and that means our cost of funding would go up substantially, and we would have to increase those loan rates to customers, and there would be probably loss of revenues, loss of sales in that situation."
"Mr. Bachus","So either cost to farmers and those who bought industrial equipment more, or it would--their costs are borne--"
"Mr. Holmes","The cost of acquiring equipment, the cost of financing it would increase and it would also make us less competitive in the international markets."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Mr. Hixson?"
"Mr. Hixson","For us, we have estimated it would cost approximately about a billion dollars depending upon market conditions, an additional amount of money we would have to borrow. For some local context, one of our largest investments--we have two members from Kansas City sitting here. We built a brand new oil facility, our largest in the United States, in Kansas City. So for us we would have to choose whether you put that money in margin or do you continue and build that plant. That is the type of thing we have to decide."
"Mr. Bachus","It would certainly impact the number of employees you have. Thank you. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, is recognized."
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you. The over-the-counter derivatives market is a $592 trillion casino. By comparison, Las Vegas is just a grain of sand. And it worked pretty well up until last year in large part because everybody at the casino thought that if the casino went under, the Federal Government would be there to bail them out. Those who played at the AIG casino were right. Those who played at the Lehman Brothers casino turned out to be wrong, they were surprised, the whole world was surprised, and we had people running for the exits when they discovered that the implicit Federal guarantee wasn't absolutely there. So the question going forward is whether we want to recreate a system that works only with some sort of implicit Federal guarantee. Now, if you look at the Treasury draft, it provides for unlimited, permanent TARP and when the Secretary of the Treasury was here, I asked him whether he was willing to limit that power to merely $1 trillion and he said no. So the question we have is, not does this system help business, but is it worth multitrillion dollars of risk to the taxpayer to keep it going or alternatively, is there a way to design it that would allow it to work without any kind of implicit Federal guarantee? Mr. Holmes, you have used derivatives. Could you make it work if it was clear that your counterparties did not have an implicit Federal guarantee, that the taxpayers were not part of the system?"
"Mr. Holmes","I believe so. You have to understand the counterparties that you are dealing with. We deal with the large commercial and investment banks that we have had relationships with for on average 30 years. Some of those relationships go back 100 years. Having said that, we still have credit limits that we place on our exposures with those counterparties. And when we approach those limits, we curtail our activity. Certainly during the credit crisis we were concerned about some of those counterparties, but the failure of any one of them would not have been a major financial problem."
"Mr. Sherman","So if we don't adopt proposed Section 1204 providing the Treasury with that unlimited bailout authority, you will still be okay? Mr. Johnson, you are the only person here representing a public interest entity. Do over-the-counter derivatives do this economy so much good that in order keep them going, the taxpayer should give to the Executive Branch unlimited bailout authority to bear whatever risk future Administrations decide is necessary under whatever exigencies occur in the future?"
"Mr. Johnson","The answer to your question is no."
"Mr. Sherman","Okay. I would point out, I believe, you are here at the request of the Administration and you are helping me illustrate how that one section of the Administration's proposal is not helpful."
"Mr. Johnson","Let me say that I was unaware that I was here at the request of the Administration."
"Mr. Sherman","I know. Yes. And I should make a further comment based on the ranking member's comments. His comments seem to be on the order of, well, the old system was working just fine except for subprime. I would point out it was working fine because it had an implicit Federal guarantee and the market was shocked when Lehman Brothers was outside of what people thought was that umbrella. So it is hard to say the old system was working fine when it only worked with an implicit Federal guarantee that I think most of our colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted against. Mr. Hill, can Morgan Stanley do just fine without a code section that allows the Administration to bail you out without consulting Congress in the future?"
"Mr. Hill","Thanks for the question. I respectfully disagree with the characterization of the market as a giant casino, though. I would like to say that a healthy and robust financial market--"
"Mr. Sherman","Let me interrupt. Do we have any proof that a majority of the debts or derivatives placed were placed by people who had real business reasons as opposed to just folks who thought they could make money because they could guess which way the price of orange juice was going to go?"
"Mr. Hill","The foundation of any financial market is both hedgers and speculators. That has been the case for over 200 years with the advent of the futures markets, as well--"
"Mr. Sherman","Do we know how many of each we have?"
"Mr. Hill","I, off the top of my head, cannot tell you what percentage of the market is comprised of hedgers versus speculators but I assure you there are both."
"Mr. Sherman","In Las Vegas, it is 100 percent speculators. And derivatives seems to be close. I yield back. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. The gentleman from Illinois, Mr. Manzullo, is recognized."
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you. Let me ask probably the most simple question. I ask the same question just as Mr. Sherman asks the same question every time we have somebody talking about these instruments. If the subprime market had not gone sour, would there have been any problems with the derivative markets? I know you are all anxious to jump into that one."
"Mr. Sleyster","I would just pass along the experience that within the life insurance industry, we are restricted in the use of derivatives to two things: We can either replicate an asset that we could have otherwise bought, which is restricted in and of itself; or we can use it for hedging purposes. And I think we would say that our experience as people who use these for risk management and hedging tools was that even through this extraordinarily difficult cycle, derivatives served us very well and, in fact, served as significant risk mitigants so that we could stand behind the promises that we made while we have significant counterparty exposure risk that we have to manage. As Mr. Holmes noted, we think about the credit exposure, the potential credit exposure that we can have with counterparties and we, in fact, post collateral and limit the amount of business that we do. So I think we would say it actually worked quite well for this cycle for most of the end- users, and certainly for the life of insurance companies."
"Mr. Manzullo","Mr. Holmes, and then Mr. Johnson. Go ahead."
"Mr. Holmes","Yes. Certainly our major concern through the credit crisis was the health of our counterparties. And it certainly didn't appear that any of the interest rate swaps in which end-users were participants or foreign exchange transactions were the things that created financial difficulties for our counterparties. It was the subprime market, as you indicated."
"Mr. Manzullo","Mr. Johnson?"
"Mr. Johnson","I believe that the subprime market was the catalyst, the trigger in this episode and the opacity that was associated with the collateralized debt obligations. The funny ratings from the rating agencies played a very large role. But I do not think that is the exclusive source of opacity in this very large scale derivatives markets. Nor, by the way, do I think that derivatives are--I think they play a meaningful role, but they have to be structured so that as the gentleman speaking before me said, counterparties can assess each other and not become afraid and not withdraw credit in times of crisis or shock that emanates from any source, domestic or foreign."
"Mr. Manzullo","Okay."
"Mr. Ferreri","Could I add some insight to that, please? As an inter-dealer broker, when we hear stories from end-users, our customers are not end-users as the dealers that they deal with. The interest rate swap market, even during the crisis, the height of the crisis, operated very effectively and very efficiently. The foreign exchange market that our members operate, operated very effectively and very efficiently. The London Clearing House, in a report to the European Commission, made a case that after Lehman failed, $9 trillion in interest rate swaps with Lehman as a counterparty were in the Clearing House, more than 60,000 trades. Those trades settled through the Clearing House without a single dollar lost of member funds. So although there may be underlying problems in a certain aspect or a certain area, the breadth of the marketplace and the ability for the dealers to participate as market makers instinctively for the inter-dealer market was certainly proven to be strong."
"Mr. Manzullo","Mr. Hill?"
"Mr. Hill","Yes. I would agree with what has been said. I think the key thing here is that with respect to all the markets we have been talking about, interest rates, currencies, and the corporate credit default swap market, the underlying instrument on which the derivative was based was a relatively liquid and transparent market. For example, with respect to the corporate CDS market, the underlying corporate credits were typically 34 reporting companies. So people who are transacting in the corporate credit default swaps understood the risks they were taking because the underlying credits were reporting companies that had financials, had to file periodic reports as their material events changed, and therefore the corporate credit default swap market actually performed very, very well during the financial crisis. In fact, it was far more liquid and far more transparent than the bond market. The problem with the subprime credit default swap market was not with the credit default swap itself, but how the underlying instrument that people were basing their derivatives on--"
"Mr. Manzullo","Was crap."
"Mr. Hill","Was misunderstood. Not only was it that--"
"Mr. Manzullo","It was."
"Mr. Hill","It was misunderstood. People assumed that borrowers disclosed their incomes correctly, people assumed lenders checked, people assumed the real estate appraisals were done accurately. And it turned out that a lot of those things weren't the case. So I have always felt the focus should be less so on the derivative and more so on what is the derivative on and is that market performing correctly. And I think in this case of the subprime, it clearly wasn't. In the case of the corporate bond market and the corporate CDS market, it certainly was."
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you. Mr. Moore of Kansas. I have been asked by Chairman Frank to clarify for the record that the White House did not invite any witnesses. All the invitations came from the chairman. I have just been asked to state that for the record and I have done it. Thank you, Mr. Manzullo. And next, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Meeks, is recognized for questions."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you. And I yield to Mr. Watt."
"Mr. Watt","I thank the gentleman for yielding just long enough for me to apologize to the members of the panel for having to run out and not being here to ask questions. That is probably a blessing to you. But also second, to ask unanimous consent to submit for the record a statement of Shawn Dorsch, who is my constituent and the founder of Blackbird Holdings, Inc., on the subject matter of today. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Without objection, it is so ordered."
"Mr. Watt","I yield back to the gentleman and I thank him profusely."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you. One of the issues that I have been very focused on is what is taking place right now with the money that is still caught up in the U.K. with Lehman Brothers. And a lot of foundations and institutions and you are talking about money that is really caught up there. So I was wondering in looking at the draft--but I guess I will address this to Mr. Kaswell--that if the key pillars of the discussion draft had been in place at the time of the Lehman's bankruptcy, how would things have--would things be the same? Would they have evolved differently? And particularly, I am interested in the two key pillars of the independent third-party custodians and the central clearing of trades by major-market participants. Would it have made a difference?"
"Mr. Kaswell","Thank you for your question, Congressman. I want to commend you for your leadership on this issue. The Lehman situation in the United States and the United Kingdom has been an unmitigated mess. And by focusing attention on it, shining a bright light on it, we think you are helping to resolve these issues. For my constituency, we are investors and we represent other investors, pension funds, college endowments and so on. And their money is tied up in Lehman, LBIE as they call it in the U.K., and also in LBI in the United States. And the most recent effort to resolve it did not work out. I understand there is going to be another effort starting tomorrow perhaps. But this is our investors' money that is sitting there. So again, we appreciate the efforts you have made in that regard. The bill would go a long way toward addressing some of the concerns because of its protection of collateral by segregating it off into a central clearing facility, in some cases, if it is a centrally cleared derivative, or in the case of an OTC product, providing customers with the option of having it segregated. So putting collateral and margin aside in a segregated account would have made a substantial difference in LBIE. And so that is one thing that we think is important. The Lehman administration, I think, is another issue. There are different approaches to that, and I think we could talk about that more at another time. Another issue I think is important is portability, the ability to move assets from a failing clearing member, if there were such clearing member, to another clearing member and to move those positions over quickly and efficiently. This would make a tremendous difference in avoiding the kind of nightmare we have had with LBIE. So thank you for the question."
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you. Let me jump now to Mr. Hall. The bill provides an exemption for swaps that did not involve dealers or so-called major swap participants, likely excluding anyone that uses swaps for hedging operational risks. This may mean that it is primarily contracted between dealers or between a dealer and fund managers that have to be cleared. Could you comment, if you will, on the amount of outstanding trade that this likely represents and whether this level of clearing will be enough to make a meaningful reduction in the level of systemic risk associated with the derivatives."
"Mr. Hall","Sure. I would be happy to. Approximately somewhere between probably 85 and 90 percent of transactions are between major-market participants. So as this draft allows and can require, is that those transactions would need to be, first of all, cleared if the regulator requires that they would be cleared; and then second of all, it allows the regulators to set margin requirements. So that would address the vast majority of the--that would address the systemic risk in the system. And we have some concerns with the definitions and the definition of major swap participants. The language around substantial net position is undefined. We are actually concerned that threshold could be set too low so that it could require normal businesses who are using derivatives for risk management purposes, maybe they have other transactions that wouldn't qualify, they could get caught up in that definition. But to answer your question specifically, this language would catch the largest counterparties. In the previous panel--I should point out in the previous panel, it was pointed out that Government-Sponsored Enterprises such as Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac that are doing transactions that might broadly fall under the range of risk management may avoid being captured by this language. So we think there is still some work to be done on these paragraphs, but I think it is definitely moving in the right direction."
"Mr. Meeks","I am out of time already? Mr. Moore of Kansas. Yes, you are. The Chair recognizes Mr. Manzullo for a unanimous consent request."
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you, Chairman. I ask unanimous consent that the statement of John Hollyer, principal and head risk management of strategy analysis at Vanguard, be made a part of the record. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Without objection, the statement will be made a part of the record. And I recognize myself for a unanimous consent request, a statement on proposed reform of over-the-counter derivatives markets from the electric power and natural gas industries. Without objection, this will also be made a part of the record. Next, the Chair recognizes Mr. Garrett from New Jersey."
"Mr. Garrett","Thank you. And I thank the panel. In the last comment--we have heard before actually that this is a step in the right direction. We have heard a lot of people say that. The Administration had their plan here. The chairman has come out with his plan here, which is a step in the right direction. I guess as I hear that, I often think that had you all the opportunity to push that proverbial reset button on this debate--and we haven't passed legislation yet and we haven't had a markup yet--is the legislation or even the draft legislation that we have really the type of legislation that you think we need in order to address the problems that we need to have addressed here? I will open that to anyone who wants to. In other words, if you had your druthers, would this be the legislation even with the definitional changes and what have you that you have here if we do all those? Is this the legislation that you hope to have in place come January of next year to regulate the industry?"
"Mr. Hall","I will take a crack at it, if that is okay. I think the way we view this is we have been reviewing the issue and reviewing the situation. And we have been thinking about this ever since AIG, certainly as many of you have. The key issue in our minds is systemic risk. The way to address systemic risk is to identify who are the systemically significant institutions, require that when the systemically significant institutions trade with one another, they fully collateralize their trades. They can fully collateralize their trades either through collateral arrangements or clearing or exchanges. So that would take care of the systemic risk issue. Now to the question of transparency. And if the regulators need access to information, certainly let us give regulators the access to information. One of the provisions in this bill talks about central data repositories where trades can be reported. We think that is a very sound idea. So those two elements should be the key elements, the core elements. Then there should be a question of anything added to that, I think, should be examined for both of it costs and benefits."
"Mr. Garrett","I appreciate that. And I take it as significant when I said does anybody think this is what you want to have in the market and note there was no waving of hands saying, this is it. So I will ask Mr. Hixson. When you look at your company and industry, basically what you have is a Byzantine system of regulation that this draft is coming up with to address mainly just non-financial derivative dealers such as yourselves who don't have a prudential regulator out there already. So we are creating this massive regulation just to address this one little area basically. It goes with the other carve-outs that have now come in for the end-users and what have you. Couldn't we have done this in some other ways? And you addressed--Mr. Hall addressed some of it by dealing with the repository. And I guess even before that--here is a seminal question. Are you so systemically important and risky that we would have the same problems that we have dealt with over the last 9 months if we didn't do this, and you had a problem in your company?"
"Mr. Hixson","I think as the first panel kind of mentioned and certainly in the statistics on the notion of outstanding derivatives, we are tiny. So I don't think--"
"Mr. Garrett","Hoping to grow bigger, but still tiny."
"Mr. Hixson","Certainly a very small player. I would not think there is any systemic risk in what we do. And particularly given the nature of our transactions, we are providing hedges for our customers. So in essence they already have the risk on their books. They need to buy flour to run their operations, they are going to be selling the heating oil in the examples I used. So we are just trying to help them provide a product to manage that risk. So, no, we are not particularly viewed as systemic in nature. And we have a regulator. We certainly report all of our large trading positions that we do, both over-the-counter and on the exchange to the CFTC currently. That system exists for any large data amounts of transactions, we do provide that already."
"Mr. Garrett","It seems to me as we begin to get into this-- maybe I am wrong--that you can deal with the transparency issues that I came in here to hear you talk about by the repository, you can deal with the other aspect that is in this draft that Chairman Frank has put in and that is dealing with the Lehman situation regarding the segregation of funds and what all brought us to that situation. We already know what is going on in the marketplace right now is that we are moving to this clearinghouse arrangement. We don't have to get into all the definitional problems I think Mr. Hall was raising by this Byzantine structure doing it because we are already moving in the right direction. So if you did just a couple of those things, you seem like you would address a major portion of the problem. We will not, even if we pass this bill, or I think even if we pass the Administration's bill--correct me if I am wrong on this--deal with what got us here by some argument with the AIG situation because--will the AIG type of instruments be covered and be forced to be cleared through a clearinghouse? No, right? Because they are--Mr. Hall?"
"Mr. Hall","If I could. This bill does require that if you are deemed a major swap participant or if you are a swap dealer, then regulators can compel you to trade--do certain trades on exchange or clear and for other trades post margin."
"Mr. Garrett","But it wouldn't require for those types to actually go through it because they would be the unique type of product that wouldn't go through it, correct? Mr. Moore of Kansas. The gentleman's time has expired."
"Mr. Garrett","You can do a quick nod."
"Mr. Hall","If it is a unique product, they still could require margins."
"Mr. Garrett","Margins only. Thanks. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The Chair next recognizes the gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver."
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. How many of your associations or agencies are related to other associations or agencies at the table? How many of you are connected in any way?"
"Mr. Kaswell","I am not sure I understand the question. I represent the Managed Funds Association, which is the trade group."
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes, I understand. And so what trade groups that you represent are also connected with any of the other associations or groups that are represented at the table?"
"Mr. Kaswell","I don't believe we are connected."
"Mr. Cleaver","None of you are related in any way, not connected in any way? The people you represent are not--don't have any relationship at all?"
"Mr. Hall","An affiliate of Prudential is one of our clients, but that is the only connection I have."
"Mr. Kaswell","There may be cross membership."
"Mr. Ferreri","I was just going to add that. My company, ICAP, is a member of the WMBA and also a member of SIFMA."
"Mr. Cleaver","So if we really took a little time, we could probably come to the realization that most--there is some kind of connection with those companies you represent and others represented at the table? Am I right about it? We just took a little short period--we haven't taken lot of time. We have already seen that there are some crossovers."
"Mr. Kaswell","Right. But there are different perspectives. We are--"
"Mr. Cleaver","I understand. That is not where I am going. I wanted to just see what the relationships would be."
"Mr. Holmes","Certainly as an end-user, I am not aware of any direct relationships I have with these other associations, yes."
"Mr. Cleaver","No. That is not what--I am not saying you have a relationship with them. I am saying that in the industry that you represent, some of those members would have relationships with the members of the agencies represented at the table. Is that clearer?"
"Mr. Kaswell","Yes."
"Mr. Johnson","In my case, there are no cross affiliations."
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes. You are segregated. Earlier today, Mr. Gary Gensler, the Chairman of the Commodities Futures Trading Commission was here. He actually delivered a speech last month. And in his speech, he said that he believed that institutions are becoming ``too-interconnected-to-fail'' and not ``too-big- to-fail,'' that the real problem is that we are developing a pyramid financial system in this country and so everybody is connected and so if one block falls it could conceivably knock down all the other blocks because of their connectivity. None of you agree with that, do you?"
"Mr. Sleyster","If I could. As representing insurance companies, we believe very strongly in diversification and we believe in posting collateral and the kinds of things that can protect you from concentrations. But clearly as the world gets smaller, as financial institutions, for example, merge--if you had holdings in two of those bonds and there is a merger, then suddenly your exposure to a single firm has gotten much larger and you have to work those down. So I think certainly we are concerned about concentration and about using things like CDS and derivatives and OTC contracts quite frankly to help us mitigate and spread out that risk when those kind of events occur. But certainly they are real risks and real concerns."
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes, I appreciate that. You and I are on the same wavelength. That is a concern. When he expressed that, I have frankly thought a great deal about that and wonder whether or not the ``too-big-to-fail'' is really something we are concentrating on. And that even if we conclude that we have come up with a solution to that, we still have a problem because of this interconnectedness. And I think my time is running out just as I was--all right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. The Chair next recognizes himself for a question. As we consider where to draw the line of jurisdiction between the SEC and the CFTC, I think Chairman Frank has a very interesting perspective. If you can eat it, it should remain the CFTC and the Agriculture Committee that has jurisdiction; but if it is a financial matter, it should remain with the SEC. In the grey areas like interest rate swaps and currencies I would like to hear from the entire panel whether the SEC or the CFTC should have jurisdiction of these items. Are interest rate swaps and currencies a financial matter that should be under the SEC's jurisdiction? I will start with my fellow Kansan, Mr. Hixson, and just go down the line if we could, please."
"Mr. Hixson","We have really not waded into the jurisdictional dynamic if you will. We have really tried to focus on the use of the instrument and if you are a hedger and focus on kind of exemptive language and clarifying that segment. So I don't know that we really have a lot to offer on the dynamics of the various agencies. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Very good. Professor?"
"Mr. Stulz","I don't have much to offer on this. I was concerned this morning about the lack of selectivity of the CFTC to end-users. I am much more concerned about focusing on exchanges and that would be a concern to me. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Very good. Next, sir, Mr. Sleyster?"
"Mr. Sleyster","The ACLI did not express a view on that, but I would reiterate our concern that we would like those agencies to have the ability to deal with issues as they emerge on a real-time basis. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Very good. Mr. Hall, sir?"
"Mr. Hall","We don't have experience with either agency. So this will need new--I think our concern is that the testimony this morning, they clearly want to move towards clearing and exchanges. So to the extent they have latitude, we are concerned at the implications of our clients. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Mr. Hill?"
"Mr. Hill","The system is agnostic under this jurisdiction. But I will point out that there are some unusual aspects of the way the current split is set up. So, for example, in the case of corporate credit default swaps, where if you do a single name corporate credit default swap, it would be with one agency. But if you did a corporate credit default swap of 25 names which is effectively just 25 of those single names combined, it is a different agency and that seems like an odd result to me. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. Mr. Kaswell?"
"Mr. Kaswell","We don't have a formal position on the issue. We think it is a decision for the Congress. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Right. Mr. Holmes, sir?"
"Mr. Holmes","We have not done any exchange traded transactions that would give us experience with either organization, so we don't have an opinion at this time. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Mr. Ferreri?"
"Mr. Ferreri","As an operator of a marketplace, we are regulated by both the SEC and the CFTC. What we would hope would happen--the company I represent, ICAP, is a London-based company that operates under a single regulator. We operate regulated derivatives platforms. I think if there is enough harmonization between the trading transparency rules, between the two commissions, it would go a long way to making this an easier goal to achieve. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you, sir. Finally, Mr. Johnson?"
"Mr. Johnson","I tend to concur with Mr. Ferreri, that making things easier and more harmonized would help market participants. In this particular year, I have had very good experience with Mr. Gensler's work. So as one particular chairman at one particular time, I think he is making a great deal of progress. I have less familiarity with the SEC. Mr. Moore of Kansas. My thanks to the panel. I yield back the balance of my time. Next, the Chair recognizes Mr. Adler of New Jersey."
"Mr. Adler","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, thank you for your patience this afternoon. I was struck by a line of questioning by Mr. Garrett, my colleague from New Jersey, a few moments ago, who I think was trying to bait you into criticizing this legislation. My sense sitting by the previous sponsor of a similar bill, Mr. McMahon, is this particular piece of legislation recognizes the good aspects of derivatives, is trying to avoid some of the systemic risk problems, offers an opportunity for greater transparency and relieving some of the opacity which was, I think, hurting but maintains the prudent risk management tools that all of you need and particularly the end-users here--I heard from Mr. Holmes and Mr. Hixson in particular talking about how this is a positive thing to preserve the good aspects of derivatives. So I guess I would like to have the flip side of Mr. Garrett's question to you. If you could briefly tell me that this is good legislation that I should support, that by and large will preserve the good aspects of risk management for end-users, but also protect the American people from some of the disasters we heard about, even from your own testimony about AIG. And I welcome any of you jumping in on that one."
"Mr. Ferreri","I would love to take the first shot at it. These are comprehensive bits of legislation. There are a lot of components, to them. I will speak to the components that my association would focus on, those being central clearing and transparency. We have the ability today in real-time to send trades between major financial institutions and the OTC derivatives market to a central repository in real-time. The U.S. Treasury market is an over-the-counter centrally cleared market. Trades are novated in milliseconds between counterparties hundreds of thousands of times a day. There are components of the bill that strengthen that on the derivatives side. Our association is fully supportive of those aspects of the bill. With regard to central clearing and the risk that mitigate, again centrally cleared products with a nondiscriminatory access to the clearinghouse gives us an opportunity to get these transactions done, get them into a clearinghouse and move onto the next trade. There are components that our association supports of the bill."
"Mr. Adler","And before you go, I also heard testimony or read testimony about your legitimate ongoing concerns about capital requirements and margin requirements and the segregation of assets for collateral. So you can reiterate that, but I at least have heard that clearly. But I would welcome other gentlemen speaking."
"Mr. Holmes","Well, I would like to comment on one really positive aspect, I think, of the regulation and that is the reporting and information gathering. There is quite a bit of information about derivatives that are disclosed by corporations today in the aggregate, but not at the transaction level. That information will be very useful in determining whether companies are truly hedging underlying risks or speculating. So I think that is very helpful. The margining and collateral requirements being a real concern for our particular firm."
"Mr. Adler","Understood. Mr. Johnson, you were patient."
"Mr. Johnson","What I feel is that you are faced with a tension between wanting to standardize, harmonize, make things more transparent on the one hand and preserve the capacity for customization for end-users on the other. I think this is a real entrant into the dialogue, along with the Administration's bill and some of the work that Gary Gensler has done. But I think at this point, the danger of this particular draft after my first reading within the last 18 hours, is that some of the definitions of nonmajor market participants and so forth could end up spilling over to create unintended what you might call laxity or benefit for some of the major ``too-big-to-fail'' financial institutions. And I would urge the committee--and I will put a written submission in on how to tighten that language."
"Mr. Adler","I would desperately urge you to do that, because we are going to be doing something on this measure very, very soon. So your written comments would be very helpful. I know Mr. Hall would like to comment that we want to make sure that we preserve the customized nature of derivatives as much as possible."
"Mr. Hall","I think the question is, what is good about this bill and what do we like. I think you addressed some of the concerns, the margin and the capital. There is a couple of other kind of more definitional concerns that we had in our testimony. But I want to emphasize that we believe that this bill is the most thoughtful bill to date. And I think it has a lot of hope of trying to balance the needs for end-users with addressing the systemic risk issue."
"Mr. Adler","Since I am sitting next to a previous sponsor of a derivatives bill, I think the previous bill was also very thoughtful."
"Mr. Sleyster","If I could. One observation with sympathy to sort of the expressed view, we felt like derivatives actually worked very well as a risk-management tool through the cycle. And when we reported to our own board about experiences of the cycle, that was actually one of the items we noted that worked well. The reason we think it worked well for the life insurance industry is that we already have a restricted use from our own State regulators that we can only use derivatives for hedging a replication. And so one of the observations I think I would make is that we don't think it is necessarily--we don't see why we would need to be regulated by the CFTC or the SEC on that. Thank you."
"Mr. Adler","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you. I would ask unanimous consent that Mr. McMahon--who is not a member of this committee--be permitted to ask questions. Mr. McMahon, you are recognized sir."
"Mr. McMahon","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and to the ranking member and also to Mr. Adler for not objecting to allowing me to ask a few questions. I appreciate that very much. And also for the shout-out on the many portions of our bill which are part of the chairman's draft for discussion. We are very pleased about that. And we thank you for your great efforts in that regard as well. Again, with the new Democrats, this for us is a very important issue and it is--all politics is local. So for me back home, as I mentioned this morning, so many people from my district work on Wall Street and for the City of New York. It is just an integral part of the City's budget. It is about policemen on the street, firefighters in the fire houses, teachers in the schools. And one of the things that we have tried to--have had to make clear with the meltdown at Lehman and AIG is when it comes to derivatives, is that--and you have done that very well, many of you today, that this is not just about speculation and people sitting around in a conference room or on a trading floor somewhere on a computer on a trading platform. This is a very important part of America's economy because we are able to produce fuels or things from grain or tractors that go around the world. And that is very important. We are glad you are here. I would ask you--especially Mr. Hixson and Mr. Holmes but the others as well because I heard what you said to Mr. Adler, that we are in a pretty good place in a lot of the parts of the bill. But as end-users--and we need you to continue this dialogue so that people understand it is about the end-users, what that means to the American economy, not just for those who are using credit default swaps to speculate. As end-users, could you give us your perspectives? I know you talked a little bit about how the Administration's proposal requiring the end-users to clear and the post-margin obligations would specifically impact your business. If you would maybe start, Mr. Holmes. Tell me about the farmer in Australia and what would happen then if you had to then--if your credit was tighter and what that would mean to your business. And I know you just touched on this, but we have been in and out during the day. So if you could just for the record."
"Mr. Holmes","Well, if we weren't carved out as a nonmajor swap participant and we had to clear all of our transactions and post initial and variation margin or collateral, we would have to curtail significantly our hedging activities because-- in my testimony, I indicated that our credit operation, which executes the majority of our derivatives, is prohibited from posting collateral under its indentures. And that prohibition will last as long as the debt is outstanding for up to 10 years. So we would have to curtail our hedging activity and that would increase the volatility that we experience and ultimately the price of our goods that we sell internationally, as well as the cost of our financing for our customers both domestically and internationally."
"Mr. McMahon","So the derivatives, the ability to hedge your risk is sort an oil in your tractor, so to speak, that allows it to run of your company, allows it--we are always looking for metaphors that we hope some reporter will write down. But it is your ability to function, to allow the goods and services to flow worldwide ultimately, right?"
"Mr. Holmes","Absolutely. It helps us to smooth out our cash flows, which enables us to invest on a consistent basis. And that is a really important aspect."
"Mr. McMahon","And there are some who think that you could-- instead of using derivatives, you could do that by getting credit from a bank to--in lieu of--or at least post a margin by getting credit from a bank. What would that mean to your business?"
"Mr. Holmes","Well--"
"Mr. McMahon","Could you get that credit in today's market? And what would it mean?"
"Mr. Holmes","Certainly, credit availability and cost has changed since the credit crisis. So it would be very costly. We would have to raise hundreds of millions of dollars and keep cash on our balance sheet to meet margin requirements that instead could be productively employed in building factories and employing people."
"Mr. McMahon","Thank you. Mr. Hixson?"
"Mr. Hixson","I appreciate the chance to discuss this. In a local kind of example, maybe in your background or at least for your upstate brethren in their backyards. One, we have a large export grain facility in Albany, New York where we ship wheat out. Certainly when we ship wheat to Egypt out of there, we would want to hedge the currency risk and the cost of doing that could be dramatically higher. And I think at times, we forget there are consumer benefits as well, particularly for the type of program I described in our kind of a distributor product for where we do a hedge for a heating oil. Well, if you figure a small job where I may sell $1 million worth of heating oil in the northeast, the initial margin on that contract would typically be somewhere around 10 percent or so. So you have to post $100,000 of margin if you are that little guy out there doing this and you have the margin all the way through there. That would be expensive for that small business."
"Mr. McMahon","Thank you very much. And thank you for your patience today. And just a shout-out to Mr. Ferreri who is a constituent of mine from Staten Island. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your indulgence and allowing me to be here today. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Thank you sir. And the Chair at this time recognizes Mr. Manzullo for a unanimous consent request."
"Mr. Manzullo","I ask unanimous consent that a statement from the International Swaps and Derivatives Association be made a part of the record. Mr. Moore of Kansas. Without objection, it will be received in the record. And I would like to thank each of the panelists for appearing here today and giving us your testimony, the benefit of your expertise and information on this subject that we are discussing here. The Chair notes that some members may have additional questions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. Again, thanks to our panelists. And at this time, this hearing is adjourned.   "
