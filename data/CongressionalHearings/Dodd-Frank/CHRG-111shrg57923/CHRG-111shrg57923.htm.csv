Speaker,Speech,Type,Comments
"Senator Bayh","Good afternoon, everyone. I am pleased to call to order this Subcommittee for the hearing entitled ``Equipping Financial Regulators with the Tools Necessary to Monitor Systemic Risk.'' I want to thank my Ranking Member, Senator Corker, and Senator Reed, my friend and colleague, and their hard-working staff for requesting this hearing on an issue that may seem technical to some, but will prove critical as we work to reform and modernize our regulatory structure for the future. I would also like to welcome and thank our able witnesses who are here today and thank our staff who have been instrumental with regard to technical aspects of this analysis. I am so happy to continue the dialog that we have already begun on how to equip our regulators to move beyond examining individual institutions and toward monitoring and managing systemic risk across our financial system. To our witnesses that will appear on two separate panels, welcome and thank you for appearing before the Subcommittee to give an outline on regulators' current capabilities to collect and analyze financial market data and, most importantly, what additional resources and capabilities are necessary to provide effective systemic risk regulation. I understand very well that the weather in Washington the last few days has not been ideal. As a matter of fact, some of our witnesses have been stranded here for several days. So I appreciate the dedication you have shown in making it here today, and we promise to be, accordingly, most merciful in our questioning. Before I turn to Governor Tarullo--and, Dan, thank you again for appearing before the Subcommittee; you have been here very ably on other occasions--I would like to submit a few comments for the record. I have a somewhat lengthy statement given the technical nature of the subject matter. I would like to submit that for the record, but will not read it. Is that all right with you, gentlemen? Very good. Hearing no objection, I will go ahead and do that.",Speech, 
"Senator Bayh","Before introducing Governor Tarullo, first, Senator Reed, perhaps you would have some comments you would like to share.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Very briefly, Mr. Chairman. I would like my statement submitted to the record also. I want to welcome Governor Tarullo also. I want to thank you for holding this hearing at the suggestion of Senator Corker, and this is a vital area and could, I think, be overlooked. But it is incredibly important. What we all witnessed over the last several years is not only great market turmoil but great market uncertainty. My impression of a lot of the problems with Lehman, with Bear Stearns, with AIG is the fact that regulators and other banking institutions had no idea where their liabilities, their risks, their counterparty exposure lay, and there was no systemic way to calculate or aggregate that information. And as a result, I think the regulators were flying blind, essentially, doing the best they could, trying to work things out, but a lot of it was just sort of flying with instruments that were not working in bad weather. It was more seat-of-the-pants than systemic regulation. So one of the things I think we have to do is create a repository of information available to regulators, available to the public with appropriate delays, so that the system is much more understandable and that, when there is a shock to the system, markets do not react out of fear, they react with some knowledge. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED 
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Senator Reed. Now, we have on this Committee become accustomed to something we call the Corker rule, where violating--or not violating, actually a breathtaking, refreshing difference from senatorial custom, Senator Corker is known for his brevity in opening statements. But since you request the hearing today and I know this is a major priority of yours, perhaps you would have some opening comments you would like to share.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I will be very, very brief. Number one, thank you for having this hearing. I know it is Friday afternoon. It has been snowing, and a lot of us are trying----",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR BOB CORKER 
"Senator Bayh","We have been trying since Tuesday to have this hearing.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Right, but I thank you so much, and I want to thank Governor Tarullo for always being available and helping us think through these complex issues. Our second panel especially, Governor Tarullo, has, I know, been holed up on hotels and hanging around for several days to cause this testimony to actually occur prior to recess. I think everybody knows we are hopefully working toward a regulatory reform bill. It is important to get this testimony into the public record so we can potentially act upon it. So we thank you all for being here, for your ideas, and with that, Mr. Chairman, as you walk out the door, thank you so much for having this hearing. I appreciate it.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, and on behalf of Senator Bayh and Senator Corker, let me introduce our first witness, Daniel K. Tarullo, who is a Governor of the Federal Reserve Board. He is an expert in international finance. He received his education beginning at Roxbury Latin School, and then he went on to Georgetown University, Duke University, and graduated with his law degree from Michigan. Prior to assuming his responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, he was a faculty member at the Georgetown Law School and prior to that served in the Clinton administration as Assistant Secretary of State for Economic and Business Affairs and other important responsibilities. Again, Governor, thank you for your presence, and we look forward to your statement.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Senator Reed and Senator Corker, and thank you both for your attention to a subject whose importance to financial stability is, as Senator Reed said a moment ago, often overlooked in the broader debates about reform. Good information is crucial to the success of any form of regulation as it is to the success of any form of market activity. But many features of financial activity make the quality and timeliness of information flows even more significant for effective regulation. Most important, perhaps, is the interconnectedness of financial services firms. In few other industries do major players deal so regularly with one another, as a result of which major problems at one firm can quickly spread throughout the system. The financial crisis revealed gaps in the data available to both Government regulators and to private analysts. It also revealed the relatively undeveloped nature of systemic or macroprudential oversight of the financial system. With this experience in mind, I believe there are two goals toward which agency and congressional action to improve data collection and analysis should be directed. First, to ensure that supervisory agencies have access to high-quality and timely data that are organized and standardized so as to enhance their regulatory missions, including containment of systemic risk; And, second, to make sure such data available to other Government agencies, to private analysts, to academics, in appropriately usable form so that the Congress and the public will have the benefit of multiple perspectives on potential threats to financial stability. My written testimony details some of the initiatives at the Federal Reserve to enhance the type and quality of information available to us in support of our exercise of consolidated supervision over the Nation's largest financial holding companies. I would stress also, though, the importance of using that information to regulate more effectively. The Special Capital Assessment we conducted last year of the Nation's 19 largest financial firms demonstrated how quantitative, horizontal methodologies built on consistent data across firms could complement traditional supervision. It also showed the importance of having supervisory needs and knowledge determine data requirements. We are building on that experience and adding a more explicitly macro prudential dimension and developing a quantitative surveillance mechanism as a permanent part of large-firm oversight. While there is much that the Federal Reserve--and other agencies such as the SEC--can do and are doing under existing authority, I do believe we will need congressional action to achieve fully the two goals I stated a moment ago. There are a number of specific areas in which legislative changes would be helpful. Let me briefly mention three. First, it is very important that Government agencies have the authority to collect information from firms not subject to prudential supervision, but which may nonetheless have the potential to contribute to systemic risk. Without this ability, regulators will have a picture of the financial system that is incomplete, perhaps dangerously so. Second, it appears to me that greater standardization of important data streams will only be achieved with a congressional prod. This objective of standardization has for years proved elusive, even though most observers agree that it is critical to identifying risks in the financial system. Third, there will need to be some modifications to some of the constraints on information colleague by Government agencies, such as authority to share that information with foreign regulators or to release it in usable form to the public. Since privacy, proprietary information, intellectual property, reporting burden, and other important interests will be implicated in any such modifications, it is most appropriate that Congress provide guidance as to how these interests should be accommodated in a more effective system of financial data collection. Finally, as you consider possible legislative changes in this area, I would encourage you to consider the relationship between the authorities and responsibilities associated with data collection and the substantive regulatory authorities and responsibilities entrusted to our financial agencies. Generally speaking, regulators have the best perspective on the kind of data that will effectively advance their statutory missions. Indeed, without the authority to shape information requirements, their effectiveness in achieving these missions can be compromised. This is all the more important given the current state of knowledge of systemic risk in which there are as many questions as answers. In these circumstances in particular, the insights gained by supervisors through their ongoing examination of large firms and of markets should be the key, though not the exclusive determinant, of new data collection efforts. This does not mean that agencies should collect only the information they believe they need. The aim of providing independent perspectives on financial stability means that other data may be important to collect for the use of private analysts, academics, and the public. The agencies can certainly be asked to collect other forms of information that are important for independent assessments of financial stability risks. But I think this relationship does counsel considerable symmetry between regulatory responsibility and data collection. Thank you for your attention and, again, for having this hearing. I would be pleased to try to answer any questions you might have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM 
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you very much, Governor Tarullo. Let me first ask the question that this need for better information is not exclusive to the United States. Could you comment on how other G-20 countries are trying to deal with this and the need for not just a national approach but an international approach?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Certainly, Senator. A number of other regulators and overseers around the world have already begun to address the issue of information, among them the various organs of the European Union and the United Kingdom, the Bank of England. The G-20 itself has issued a couple of recommendations that are particularly salient to this question on developing a template for reporting of information of the large internationally active financial firms. Now, this is, of course, not an easy undertaking for any one nation much less for the world as a whole, but it is something which the Financial Stability Board has taken on as a task. There have been some preliminary discussions on how to organize the work of trying to see if we can come to agreement on a template for reporting of the largest, most globally active financial institutions. It is far too early to report progress there, Senator, but I can say that the effort has been launched.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you, Governor. As you know, as we are proceeding down, and I think appropriately so, a legislative path which we hope will incorporate this systemic collection of information, I have got legislation in--and, in fact, I want to thank Dr. Mendelowitz and Professor Liechty for their assistance and help. But this is going to have to be an effort that goes beyond the United States to understand that, but I think it is important that we begin here. Another aspect of this international question is the issue of sovereign behavior. The Greek Government now is in a very serious crisis which is rattling the markets. There also is some indication that another one of our favorite topics, derivatives and credit default swaps, have come into it. Apparently, there are reports that investment banking firms have helped them legally avoid treaty obligations under Maastricht, et cetera. But the long and the short of it is, do we also have to include sort of sovereign entities in terms of data collection?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, I think that one of the lessons that the international community drew from some of the sovereign debt crises of the late 1990s and the very early years of this century was that there needed to be more transparency associated with a lot of sovereign debt issuance. And the International Monetary Fund undertook to create special data dissemination standards which would provide more such information. Generally speaking, I would distinguish between the sovereign information and private financial system firm information since we as regulators obviously have a mandate over private firms rather than certainly over sovereigns. It is relevant, though, for us in thinking about systemic risk because, to the degree that our large institutions have significant exposures to sovereigns which may conceivably have difficulty in servicing their debt, that becomes a matter of concern for the private financial regulators as well.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","One of the issues that repeatedly is made-- points, rather than issues--is that, you know, too big to fail is the first chapter, but the second chapter is too interconnected to fail. And that raises the issue of a focal point on large institutions might miss small institutions that could cause systemic risk. In fact, you know, there is the possibility that multiple failures in small institutions could have a systemic problem. So how do we sort of deal with that in terms of these interconnections? I mean, traditionally, it is easy for us to go to a big financial institution and say report X, Y, and Z.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Right.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","How do we capture everybody, not in a pejorative sense but in a data sense?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Sure. So let me distinguish while trying to address both the data collection and the regulatory supervisory side. I think with respect to data collection, there is little question, in our minds, at least, that the data collection authorities of U.S. Government agencies need to extend beyond the universe of firms which are subject to prudential or even market regulation. For the very reasons you suggest, a large number of intermediate size firms can themselves have a substantial amount of financial activity, which, although not necessarily associated with systemic risk in any one firm, in the aggregate can define an important phenomenon or trend or development in the economy as a whole. So we do think there needs to be that kind of authority in our financial regulators to gather the necessary information to round out the picture. When it comes to supervisory or regulatory authority, the three of us, at least, have been in this room on a number of occasions talking about the choices that we have in front of us, and one of those choices is going to be how broadly to cast or to draw the perimeter of regulation. Will it be only firms that own banks? Will it be firms beyond that which are thought to be themselves systemically important? Or will it be some broader set of firms above a certain size? And I think those issues are probably going to be more difficult to resolve than the data issues, where I personally, at least, think there is little argument against the proposition that you need to gather this information.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you. And, Senator, I want to thank you for raising this up. I do not think we would have met with our next panel without you having brought this forward, and I think you are actually responsible for all of this being brought to our attention. So thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I appreciate that. Governor, I think you are probably familiar with the National Institute of Finance, as it has been proposed, and they have discussed certainly it being done in an independent way. I think you maybe would allude more to that happening at the Fed itself. But I am wondering if you could talk to us a little bit about the pros and cons of what you know their proposal to be from the Fed's standpoint.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Certainly, Senator. So this will not surprise you to hear that I think there are some advantages and disadvantages to each of the different organizational options that you would face. One such option would be the creation of a single, free-standing agency that would have overall responsibility for all the financial data collection and a good bit of the analysis. On the other end of the spectrum would be presumably just giving more authority to a single U.S. Government--existing U.S. Government agency and saying why don't you fill in the gaps? As I suggested in my written testimony, there is probably an option in between as well, particularly as you go forward with thinking about overall reg reform. To the degree that a council emerges, as I think it might, as an important center for coordinating the oversight of systemic risk in the United States among all the various U.S. Government agencies, we may want to lodge some of the data responsibilities in the council as well. The basic advantage, I think, of the single agency is what one would infer, which is you have a single group. They can take an overview. They can say let us try to prioritize, let us try to figure out where the most important unknowns are, and we will devote our activities in that direction, and we will do so in a way that we are not always stumbling over one another because we are just one agency. Some of the costs associated with the single agency--quite apart from out-of-pocket costs, which are nontrivial, but costs in the sense of non-immediate monetary costs--would include, I think, some risk that you detach data collection from the process of supervision, the process of regulation. And I do think it is important and I think our experience over the last couple of years has borne out the importance of having those with the line responsibility for supervising and regulating being able to shape the kinds of data collection that they feel are necessary in order effectively to regulate or to supervise. In the middle of the crisis, for example, it became apparent to some of the people at the Fed that getting information on the kinds of haircuts that were being applied to some securities repurchase agreements was a very important near-term piece of information in trying to assess where the system was at that moment. If that capacity had been lodged in an independent agency, with some of its own priorities perhaps and having to go through a bit more of a process, there may--and I emphasize ``may''--have been some delays in getting to that end. So I think that, as with everything, there are going to be pluses and minuses. It will not surprise you to know that from a somewhat--from the perspective of 20th and Constitution, there would be concerns about losing the capacity to shape and act quickly on informational needs. But I hasten to add that here, as with systemic risk generally, I do not think anybody at the Fed believes that the Fed should be the sole or even the principal collector and analyzer of data. This has got to be a governmentwide priority.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","The information that you receive now, the data, how realtime is it? And I would assume during a crisis it is very important that it is daily. And then how granular is it today?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","So that varies considerably, Senator, from data stream to data stream, and I think the subject--let me be clear just that when some people say ``realtime,'' some people mean ``immediate'' by that; that as a trade happens, the data, the information about the trade is immediately available to regulators and possibly the public. For most of our supervisory purposes, that kind of literally realtime data is not critical to achieving those supervisory purposes. And, of course, as you all know, true realtime data is a very expensive thing to put together. But timely, meaning in many instances daily or end-of-the-day trading, is very important for making an assessment on a regular basis as to the stability of a firm that may be under stress. One of the things that became clear, I think, during the crisis--and for me became particularly evident during the stress tests last spring--was the substantial divergence in the capacities of firms to amass, to get a hold of their own data, to know what their own trades were, to know what their own counterparty risk exposures were. So one of the things that we have actually been doing in the wake of the Special Capital Assessment Program is placing particular emphasis on the management information systems of the firms, requiring that they themselves be able to get a hold of the data on trades or counterparty exposures or certain kinds of instrument--certain kinds of involvement with certain kinds of instruments, because if they can get a hold of it for their own internal purposes, we will be able to get a hold of it pretty quickly. So right now it is actually not so much a question of our telling them, ``Send us something you have on a daily basis.'' It is in many instances as much a matter of making sure they have the capacity to derive that information from their raw computer records and then to send it to us.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","May I ask another question, Mr. Chairman?",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Yes, sure.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","You know, of course, we all tend to try to find a solution that is unique and maybe alleviates a lot of just the daily work it takes to be good regulators, right? And a lot of what happened this last time could have been prevented with the tools we had if we just maybe had been a little more effective in regulating the way that we should have and Congress overseeing the way that it should have. But there were certainly lots of issues that caused this last crisis, if you will, to unfold. So we have had this wonderful presentation that we are going to hear next, and, you know, we envision having all this, at the end of the day, realtime type of data so we know positions throughout our country, so that regulators have the ability to know if something that is putting our country in systemic risk is occurring. What should we be concerned about there from the standpoint of having this thing that sounds really neat and costs money, how do we prevent it from being something that really is not that useful but is collecting a lot of data that I imagine takes place throughout this city that is not utilized? And then, second, I would imagine that data like that collected in one place could be used for pretty nefarious purposes if it got into the wrong hands. If we actually have it and collect it, what should be our concerns in that regard?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","OK, so with respect to your first question, I mean, I do think that the efforts of the group of academics and others who have been promoting the NIF and certainly the efforts of the National Academy of Sciences in convening that workshop have been very valuable in drawing attention to and moving the debate forward on the data needs that we really do have. And I think, Senator, just to underscore something I said earlier, the absence of data from the shadow banking system was certainly problematic in retrospect. I think that the degree to which the tightly wound, very rapid shadow banking system was channeling liquidity around the financial system and, thus, the rapidity with which it came to a screeching halt once things began to break down, is something that was at least underappreciated by even those who foresaw problems ahead. So I do think that there is--and I do not think it is a coincidence, by the way, that some of the names I saw on the list of participants in that workshop that the NAS held were the names of scholars who have written, quite insightfully, I think, on the substantive causes of the crisis and of the way in which adverse feedback loops began when things moved into reverse. So I do think we need additional data sources. Now, how to make sure that every dollar of governmental funds spent on this are spent most wisely and how to make sure that we do not demand a lot of private expenditures that are not going to useful purposes is the kind of question that I think we all confront all the time in any Government regulatory or data collection effort. And I guess I would say that that is where some of the principles that we suggested in my written testimony I hope will be of some help. Keeping the regulator and supervisory agencies closely involved and, I would hope, the prime movers of these data collection efforts I think will help because whether it is the SEC or us or the CFTC, we are going to be most concerned in the first instance with achieving our statutory missions. And so for us that would be the consolidated supervision of the largest financial holding companies and also, obviously, our monetary policy and financial stability functions. That I think is one way to do it. I think a second way would be to make sure that there is some thought about new requirements coming forward. This is why OMB has the rules they have. And as you know, we think maybe some of the Paperwork Reduction Act features need to be changed around the edges. But there is a good reason why that act exists because you do want to put the brakes on people just willy nilly saying we would like new data sources. I think actually the council, if a council of regulators were created or the President's working group could formalize such an effort, I think it would be useful to have different agencies actually thinking about what new data sources may be important and having a debate precisely to guard against any one maybe going a bit too far afield from its own regulatory mission. On the protection issue, obviously there are, as I mentioned, these important interests, proprietary interests, IP interests in some cases where vendors are involved, privacy interests where individuals are involved, a little bit less, obviously, with some of the things we are talking about. We ought to continue to have those protections. But it is also the case that our country I think wants to be protected from financial instability, and my conclusion at least is that the efforts to identify potential sources of financial stress and risk throughout the economy is not something that one or even a whole group of Government agencies should be the sole actors in. I think we do need to enable analysts, private analysts, finance professors, people who have expertise but are not in the Government, to look at what is going on in the economy to offer their views to you, to us, to the American people, and let us all filter through how much of that may be well grounded and where we might disagree. If we are going to do that, we have to figure out how to get this data into a sufficiently aggregated form so as to protect proprietary information, but to make sure that it is really useful to somebody out there who is trying to do an analysis and have some insight into what is going on in the subprime mortgage market or over-the-counter derivatives or anywhere else.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you, Governor Tarullo, and you have reminded me, I have to thank also the National Academy of Sciences because we asked them to convene that meeting and I am pleased that it produced positive results in your view and other people's view, but thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I thought maybe you were going to ask another round. If I could just ask one more question----",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Yes, and I might have one, but go ahead. You go first.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","No, go ahead. Absolutely.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, it sort of--no, why don't you go, because this is not Abbott and Costello, but you are ready.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So a number of us have been looking at speed bumps, ways for us not to be faced with resolution. We obviously, if we have resolution, want to ensure that this whole notion of too big to fail is not part of the American vocabulary. But we have had numbers of entities in recently-- today, yesterday, the day before--talking about contingent capital and the ability to take unsecured debt in an institution that is moving into problem areas and converting that immediately to common equity. I know that is a little bit off topic, but there is a lot happening. We are going on recess next week. I just wondered if you might have some comments regarding that. It is something that I think is gaining more and more attention.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Sure. Actually, Senator, we have been paying a good bit of attention to that in the Federal Reserve. I got together a group of Board staff and staff from some of the Reserve Banks to try to think through some of the potential options here. So let me first begin with a little taxonomy because different people mean different things when they talk about contingent capital. There are at least a couple of concepts here. One is a concept under which a firm would issue a specific kind of instrument which would have debt-like characteristics under normal circumstances, but by the terms of the instrument would itself have a conversion to equity when some trigger event happened. The concept behind that tends to be the following. There is a period during which a firm may still be somewhat healthy, but is beginning to deteriorate, and if capital levels go down to a certain level there will be a loss of confidence within the markets and counterparties with respect to that firm. So if at that point the trigger means that all of a sudden there are X- billion dollars more of common equity in the firm, that might provide a reassurance and stop a slide downward, and I will come back to that in a moment. A second concept is really one which is as much about the potential insolvency of the firm as it is stopping the slide. So some have proposed, for example, that all subordinated debtor all forms of debt other than specified senior tranches of debt would, at some moment, which would probably be the equivalent of when you are on the verge of insolvency, convert to equity, thereby, in effect, helping to move forward what would be a resolution process under another name, because now you have way less debt on the liability side of your balance sheet and more equity. The first is, I think, the concept that has intrigued some academics, some regulators, and, I must say, some investment bankers who probably see the opportunity to create some new forms of investment. The big issue there--there are a number of technical issues, but I think probably the biggest is what is the trigger going to be. If the trigger is supervisory discretion, you probably have an issue because everybody is going to be wondering whether the supervisor is going to pull the trigger for exogenous reasons, or when the supervisor would pull the trigger. It would create a good bit of uncertainty in the markets. A second option is that you have the trigger tied to the capital levels of the firm. Now, that still involves some supervisory discretion, but it is within the context of an ongoing regulatory system. The problem there has been that, as you know, capital tends to be a lagging indicator of the health of a firm. Many firms, 2 months before their insolvency, looked like they were adequately capitalized, and so unless we get a quicker adjustment of capital levels, that probably wouldn't do the trick. A third proposal is to have a market-based trigger, a trigger that might, for example, be the relationship between common equity and assets or something of the sort, or the market price of the--a lag market price of the firm related to assets, something that gets the market in as the trigger so that nobody can manipulate it in any way. The concern that one hears from a lot of people about that approach is that it can induce a kind of death spiral in the firm, whereby people begin trading against--when they see the price go to a certain level, they begin trading against it. So my personal--and this is really personal, this is not the Board--my personal view is that all three of these approaches have significant problems. I personally just have excluded full supervisory discretion as a real option. But I think it is worth pursuing the technical challenges around both the market-based trigger and the capital trigger and that is what we have asked our staffs to do within the Reserve Banks and the Board, to see if there is something here which can be-- and this is important--which can be a less expensive form of capital for the banks. I don't want to create anything that costs more than common equity for the banks. That is kind of a feckless undertaking. But if we can figure out a way to have a capital instrument which is there in the exigent circumstances but which costs less than common equity on a normal basis for the firms, I think that is something worth pursuing. I am sorry I was long-winded, but as you can tell, we have actually been analyzing this.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. It did give me time to think of a question.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","No, just a comment, because I think Senator Corker, as always, has raised a very interesting point, and this is a comment. When push came to shove, all the varieties of capital, risk-based capital, were essentially disregarded, the stress test, the tangible capital, or am I overstating or misstating?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","So our focus--so here is what happened, what I found so interesting during the crisis itself. During the crisis itself, private analysts, who are operating on the basis of less than full information, of course, and regulators both found themselves focused on common equity. Now, some of the market guys called it tangible common equity, but basically, it was common equity. And I think that what all of us, if we didn't already believe it, and some of us did, but if we didn't already believe it, what all of us concluded from this exercise was that common equity needed to be an even more important component of the equity of financial firms going forward. The stress tests, the SCAP, were conducted with the assumption that--or under a set of standards that looked to the common equity levels as well as the traditional tier one levels, and I think, Senator, that regulators around the world whom we talk to in the Financial Stability Board, market analysts, and the financial institutions themselves have all converged around the proposition that common equity really and truly is far and away the most important--not the only, but the most important component of regulatory capital. Why? Because if it is adequate, it allows the firm to continue as an ongoing institution. There are some forms of equity, tier two--excuse me, capital--tier two capital, which will be available to protect the Deposit Insurance Fund or senior creditors, but not to keep the firm going on an ongoing basis. And since I don't think any of us relish the thought of another go-around of major challenges to major financial institutions, I think we are all focused on finding the best way to maintain higher levels of common equity--when I say all of us, I don't just mean regulators. I think that is a market imperative, as well.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. We had a sidebar which we don't need to continue about Basel II. I think we do have to spend some time thinking hard about the rules of capital going forward. But just two quick comments about the issue at hand. I don't want to trivialize this, but essentially, this center would be on patrol for bubbles in the economy, things that could cause, you know, not in one forum but throughout the economy, real problems. Is that too simple, or is that----",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","No, I don't think it is too simple, and if I-- so if I can hearken back to a sidebar we had in a different hearing where you and I were talking about--I mentioned several times in the written and oral testimony the need for independent views of things, and this is something which I have always believed, but my conversations with you have reinforced it in this context, that no matter how good a job I think the Fed can and will do, or no matter how good a job in market regulation I think the SEC can and will do, the uncertainties around financial stability are always going to be significant because stresses and problems arise in new ways. And so I think it is important for us to foster within the government but also outside of the government the ability of multiple agents to make a judgment on this. Now, I guess I think that this is something which is best-- within the government is best pursued in a collegial fashion, which is why the council occurred to me. I think if we are doing our analyses and the SEC is doing its and Treasury is doing its, bringing those together in council discussions and determining whether there needs to be a different kind of analysis or initiative seems to me to make a lot of sense. It may also make sense--again, responding to something you suggested to me a while ago--it may also make sense to have a council have at least a smallish staff of people who themselves are dedicated to looking at all of this and maybe doing some heterodox analyses. So I think I am all in favor of that, and actually not all in favor of it in the sense of we wouldn't oppose it. I personally think it is an affirmative good.",Speech,

I would like for you to, in writing, maybe respond, just so we can get something on the public record, regarding how--going back to the collateral or the capital we were talking about a little while ago, using maybe a quarterly stress test that was made public, thinking through how something like that might help us.

"Mr. Mendelowitz","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you,",Statement,STATEMENT OF ALLAN I. MENDELOWITZ, FOUNDING MEMBER, THE COMMITTEE TO ESTABLISH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF FINANCE 
"Senator Corker","I am really very pleased to be here today as a representative of the Committee to establish the National Institute of Finance and to bring the recommendations and findings of that committee. The Committee to Establish the National Institute of Finance is an extraordinarily unique group, based on my three- and-a-half decades of experience in Washington. I have actually never seen anything like it. It is a committee that has raised no money. It is a committee that represents no vested interests. It is a committee where no single member has any personal financial interest in the outcome of our recommendations. It is a committee where we have covered our expenses, what they are, out of our own pockets, and because we never organized as a 501(c)(3), we don't even get the tax benefits associated with those expenditures. What it is, is it is a group of extraordinarily talented and, in many cases, very distinguished members, all brought together by the commonly shared view that the Federal Government and the regulatory communities lack the data and lack the research capability to effectively monitor and regulate systemic risk, and for that matter, to effectively monitor and regulate financial institutions and markets. We have come together to propose a solution to that inadequacy in the Federal Government's capability and that solution is the National Institute of Finance. And we view the National Institute of Finance as addressing the weaknesses, both respect to data and research and analytical capability, and I can't stress the importance of the research and analytical capability enough. A lot of time was spent with the earlier panel discussing data and there was far less mention of the analytical capability. The reality is, we do not have a particularly good understanding of how financial markets work because we have never had the kind of sustained research effort that would yield those insights. Despite the fact that there are research departments at large financial institutions, there is a lot of good research being done by very talented people in academia, there are research departments in the regulatory agencies, but at the end of the day, the research efforts never had access to the appropriate data or to the sustained funding to do the kind of work that would provide the analytical tools needed by regulators given the challenges that we face today. And that is why in our proposal for the National Institute of Finance we would have two key components: One, the Federal Financial Data Center; and the second, a Federal Financial Research and Analysis Center. We think the structure of the institute should be set up in a way that ensures that it can, in fact, play its key role. It would be, as we indicated, an independent agency, ideally. It would be an independent voice on issues of financial risk, regulation, and policy. It would be independent for several reasons. One, it hopefully would be free from political influence. Second, it would be free from having to investigate its own decisions and actions. As long as the institute is not a regulatory agency, it is untainted by the fact that if it were investigating itself, it would be given an impossible challenge and an impossible task if you are looking for really truly independent, high-quality assessments of what is going on. Third, the institute would be self-funded, and it would be self-funded for a couple of important reasons. One, fairness. It is our understanding, based upon the research that we have seen and the discussions we have held that adapting the common data standards associated with the Federal Financial Data Center would produce a significant reduction in operating costs on the part of financial institutions. Because it would get this benefit, it is only fair that some small share of those savings would be used to fund the operations of the institute. Second, given the burdens placed on the taxpayer and the taxpayers in this most recent crisis, it is not appropriate that taxpayers should be asked to pay for the monitoring of an industry which has already imposed a tremendous burden on the taxpayers. And third, there are certain benefits in the ability to compensate staff and attract folks that go with being funded with non-appropriated funds that would make it more competitive. All of this is critical and it, of course, would yield multiple benefits. It would yield substantial benefits in terms of improving the efficiency and effectiveness of financial regulation. It would reduce the likelihood of a future systemic event. It would make U.S. markets safer and more competitive. It would reduce the operating expenses of financial institutions. And the kind of standardized data that would be required would go a long way toward addressing one of the problems that Governor Tarullo mentioned when he commented on how he was surprised to find out that financial institutions actually didn't have a good handle on what their own exposures were and they didn't have ready access to that kind of data. Last, I just want to say how pleased we are that we learned last week that Senator Reed introduced S. 3005, the National Institute of Finance Act of 2010. That Act is structured in a way that creates a National Institute of Finance along the lines that we think would be essential to making it effective and we were really very appreciative to see that legislative measure. That concludes my oral comments and I will be happy to answer any questions you or the Committee may have.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Doctor. Professor Liechty, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Corker. I appreciate the opportunity to be here and to again also speak about or on behalf of the Committee to Establish the National Institute of Finance. I would like to just give a little history. The Committee to Establish the National Institute of Finance started a little over a year ago at a workshop that was jointly sponsored by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the National Institute of Statistical Sciences. As an academic and a professional statistician, I was really interested in the topic of the workshop, which is exploring statistical issues in financial risk and in bank regulation. I consult with some of the big investment banks, specifically helping them with issues related to modeling and valuing many of these complicated credit derivative securities that played a part in the recent crisis and I was hoping that the workshop would focus on systemic risk. But it was primarily focused on Basel I and Basel II and assessing the safety and soundness of individual institutions. And focusing on the safety and soundness of individual institutions is important, but that in and of itself will not ensure the safety and soundness of our financial system. In some ways, this approach is similar to ensuring that a group of cars going on a freeway or around a racetrack are all individually safe and sound, but then ignoring the larger dynamics of the traffic, for example, whether the cars are bunched together, they are observing safe stopping rules, or going too fast as a collective group. Now, because there was a broad collection of regulators, academics, and practitioners at this workshop, I asked a very simple question in my mind. Does anybody have the data necessary to monitor and measure systemic risk? And the informal consensus I got from that workshop is the same consensus I have heard over and over again as we have gone forward with this effort. The regulators do not have the correct data, and in addition, to get the data they need, it will probably require additional legislation. Now, I spent the bulk of my professional career developing methods and systems to go from data to information and I know that just collecting data is not enough. We have to have the appropriate analytic tools if we are going to turn that data into the useful information to be able to really monitor and measure systemic risk, and it will not only take more than data collection, it will take more than just building the models itself. In my view, in some sense, it is a fundamental scientific problem, that we have to put forward fundamental research efforts in order to be able to understand the frameworks, be able to frame the metrics, be able to get the models in place and then know what data we need. In some sense, I echo the finding that came from the National Academy of Sciences workshop which was that we really don't actually know all the data and we are not going to know until we have an iterative process, which is the fundamental part of the research process. Let me illustrate with an analogy from the weather, which is very appropriate given our last couple of days. This focuses on hurricanes. When the financial crisis of 2008 hit, the regulators and policymakers charged with keeping our financial system safe were taken by surprise. Although there were some indications of uncertainty, this financial storm hit with the same unexpected suddenness as the New England Hurricane of 1938. The Martha's Vineyard Gazette noted at that time, this tragedy was not the loss of nearly 10,000 homes and businesses along that shore. It was the psychic destruction of summer for an entire generation. Earlier hurricanes had brought structural responses from the U.S. Government. The Weather Bureau was formed in 1870 under President Ulysses S. Grant with a mandate to gather data on the weather and provide warnings of approaching storms. Even though the Weather Bureau was in place, it was not able to offer any warnings for the Category 4 hurricane that hit Galveston, Texas, September 8, 1900, and it only offered a few hours of warning for the hurricane that hit Miami September 18, By 1938, the Weather Bureau had better models, it had better data, but as the New York Times observed regarding that hurricane, the Weather Bureau experts and the general public never saw it coming. I would ask, are our regulators and policymakers any better equipped today than the Weather Bureau of 1938? In 1970, President Richard Nixon created the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, with the mandate to do three things. One, collect data to document natural variability and support predictive models. Two, to develop new analytic and forecasting tools. And three, to conduct essential long-term research to underlie these models. Now, NOAA's current real-time data collection and analysis infrastructure is very impressive. It is significant. It continues to bring substantial benefits to our society. But they were made possible mainly through and largely through the research efforts of NOAA. At this point, I would like to offer an observation and a question. Clearly, I put forward to you that our financial markets are at least as important and as complicated as the weather. If that is the case, why don't we have the equivalent of NOAA for the financial markets? When it comes to safeguarding our system, our goal should be bold, our expectations realistic, and our dedication to the task substantial. Although it will take time, the benefits will far outweigh the cost, just as they have done for hurricanes. This concludes my oral remarks. I would be open to any questions you might have.

"Mr. Engle","Thank you. It is a great pleasure to be here today. I appreciate the invitation from the Committee. Mr.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ROBERT ENGLE, PROFESSOR OF FINANCE, STERN SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, NEW YORK UNIVERSITY 
"Chairman, Mr","Corker, Mr. Reed, it is a pleasure to be here. I am here because I recently co-authored a report of the National Research Council that summarized a workshop on Technical Capabilities Needed for the Regulation of Systemic Risk. The Research Council is the operating arm of the National Academy of Sciences, the National Academy of Engineering, and the Institute of Medicine, all chartered by Congress to advise the Government on matters of science and technology. The workshop and its report were sponsored by the Sloan Foundation and were actually in response to a letter from Senator Reed. After I summarize our report, I would like to give you some personal opinions on the National Institute of Finance and the questions that were in the call. Our 1-day workshop, summarized, came to the following set of conclusions, I think. First of all, we were all convinced that with better data and better analytical tools, the problems of reducing systemic risk were actually solvable. Research necessary to accomplish this goal is already underway in both academic and regulatory settings, but it is now being carried out with purely market- based data and, therefore, does not have access to the full range of information that would be needed to make these models as accurate as possible. Additional data collection across asset classes with counterparty, position, collateral, and valuation information would be extremely helpful. Nevertheless, it was clear at the meeting that many participants were unsure exactly how great this--what data would ultimately be needed. There is an important question that keeps coming up: whether the total range of everything that you can think of is required or there is a subset that could be required, and how would you select the subset of data that is really needed. The first step in this process would be the standardization and classification particularly of the OTC contracts, and this would be, I think, a substantial benefit to the industry as well as to the regulators if this could be accomplished, and it is one of the goals of the NIF. But even more important, as Allan said just a moment ago, than the data are the models, because data alone will not tell us about risk, it will not tell us about liquidity, it will not tell us about bubbles and other features which are necessary in order to understand the risks that face our financial system. And so the analysis is extremely important as well. So that concludes my brief summary of the meeting the National Research Council had. The full summary I would ask be attached to the record.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Without objection.",Speech, 
"Mr. Engle","Now let me say a few other things in my remaining time. Data gathered by supervisory agencies is already being used in attempts to try to calculate and evaluate systemic risk. This data, however, is often available on an as- asked basis. In other words, it does not flow regularly to the agencies. They need to request it from the agencies they supervise, and this gives them only a partial picture, in any case. There is additional data within clearinghouses that is available to regulators, but, again, regulators cannot get this on a regular basis, and there is difficulty with sharing it across regulators. The same thing is true of risk reports. Risk reports are reported by financial institutions on a daily basis, but these, of course, discuss the risks of the firm, not the risks of the system, and do not have important kinds of counterparty information that we would really want to us the networks of risks across the system. So, in summary, regulators do have a substantial amount of information available, but it is not on a systematic basis, and it cannot easily be shared across regulatory agencies. Let me make just a couple more points on more general topics. It seems to me there is a question of the independence of the National Institute of Finance. I am a supporter of the proposal for the National Institute of Finance. The idea that it is an independent organization is important because it needs to be insulated from pressures from corporations and from Government. However, this independence could also be achieved if it were housed, I believe, within regulatory agencies who were already independent in that same sense. There could be substantial cost savings from such a location of NIF. The international effects of this are extremely important, and the location of the National Institute of Finance would necessarily--it would be very important that it be able to collaborate and share data and analytical tools with sister agencies around the globe; otherwise, we only see a partial picture of this financial system. Then one final comment. The security of the data is extremely important to preserve, but I think--and I think that an ultimate goal would be to make as much of this data in a delayed and aggregated form available to the public as possible. Transparency in financial markets is a great supplement to regulation. It is cheaper, and it may be more effective in many ways than much of the regulation we consider, and so an ultimate goal, I think of the National Institute of Finance would be to disseminate as much of this information as possible, and that would require congressional guidance. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Professor Engle. Mr. Horne, please.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","Thank you. Thank you, Senator Reed, Senator Corker. Thank you this afternoon for spending time with us. My name is Steve Horne. I am Vice President of Master Data Management for Dow Jones, as Senator Reed introduced me earlier. I have spent over 30 years building very complex databases and transforming highly complicated data into usable information. I have testified many times over the last year on the impact of the financial meltdown and the need for comprehensive analytic databases designed to capture the appropriate realtime information necessary to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of the IPSA Act--and ``realtime'' I think was discussed earlier-- including those of the TARP program to ensure that the American taxpayer's money is being used as intended. Legislation that would create such a database has been introduced by Senator Warner--it is S. 910--with a companion bill that has already passed the House, H.R. 1242, by a vote of 421-0. These bills have been strongly endorsed by organizations such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, OMB Watch, and the Center for Democracy in Technology. Using the same basic infrastructure of the database that would be created under the legislation that I have described, we at Dow Jones have identified over 400 leading indicators that, when used together, can identify potential systemic risk within the financial system, but also, I want to add, many other parts of the economy, which expands upon what our esteemed presenters have presented today. And the challenge is to combine this disparate data into a structured database to be able to make informed decisions and judgments about the risks that are inherent to the system. Systemic breakdowns that impact individual geographic markets in this country are caused by a combination of factors, including unemployment, bankruptcy, foreclosures, commercial real estate failure, and other factors. For example, in Las Vegas, a huge influx of different socioeconomic groups moved into this market in the past 10 years. One of these groups is retirees. And when the financial meltdown occurred, these Americans were mostly living on fixed incomes: savings, retirement investments, and their Social Security. They bought retirement homes either with cash or with mortgages that were smaller than many, but they still incurred new debt. Over the last 3 years, the income from their retirement accounts went negative. They have had to dip into principal as the only way for them to gain cash. As the foreclosures generally grew around them, the retirees saw the value of their homes decrease in half as well. Those who had mortgages were now upside down, those who did not saw the major investment they had spent a lifetime building dwindle in value. Now, these senior citizens face a much more difficult situation. With a major portion of their principal gone, they cannot afford to live on their fixed income and now may have to go back to work. In Las Vegas, 16-percent unemployment does not bode well for anybody looking for a job. If they own their home, new mortgages are very difficult to get. Reverse mortgages are not an option because of the reduced availability of these programs. And the combination of these factors shows the market for retirees in Las Vegas is in systemic failure right now. So I am expanding upon the concept of systemic failure to talk about the markets as well as the financial systems that support those markets. The example of this process is known in statistical terminology as the ``Compounding Effects of Multiple Indices.'' If we can integrate this data into an actionable database, regulators can quickly implement surgical solutions that will apply the appropriate programs and/or funds to the most serious problems. The database can be applied for potential systemic failure of the commercial real estate market that has been highlighted by the Congressional Oversight Board report that was issued just 2 days ago. And, in addition, we are currently observing markets in North Carolina and Tennessee that are at risk of systemic failure. If the proposed database were in place, the Government would be in a better position to confirm, quantify, and tackle these problems proactively. Unfortunately, the data is in disparate systems that cannot talk to each other. The value of the database that is proposed in S. 910 is in its ability to combine and analyze this data to predict and prevent systemic risk. The transformation of this data into actionable information is neither easy nor inexpensive. However, the implementation of the proposed database will save significant taxpayer dollars in three ways: first, through more efficient targeting of resources and serving the areas of greatest need; second, by enabling the Government to ensure that the appropriate actions are taken before systemic failure occurs; and, third, by helping prevent waste, fraud, and abuse of taxpayer's money. The database proposed should not create additional security concerns. The security methodologies under the IPSA Act and the contractual controls for the use of commercial data are sufficient to protect this information. In addition, language included in H.R. 1242 that passed the House provides for even greater protections for non-public data. The system being proposed is designed to expand to cover global data. Although some of the data from overseas may not be accessible due to laws of specific countries, other international data is in better shape than our own and can be built into accurate analytic systems because of the early adoption of XBRL technology by many countries. In summary, the data and technology exist today to equip financial regulators with the tools necessary to monitor systemic risk. The only thing lacking is Government action to make it happen. I want to thank you again, Senator Reed and Senator Corker, for your time and attention, and I am happy to answer any questions you may have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF STEPHEN C. HORNE, VICE PRESIDENT, MASTER DATA MANAGEMENT AND INTEGRATION SERVICES, DOW JONES & COMPANY 
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Horne. Thank you all, gentlemen, for excellent testimony, and let me begin with the comments you made, Dr. Mendelowitz. It is very difficult to review objectively your own decisions and actions. I think that is a very strong rule in every type of human endeavor, and particularly in these endeavors. And that argues, I think, strenuously for some type of independent agency. You can also factor in that there are particular cultures in agencies that obscure--illuminate and obscure analysis of data. Again, I wonder if you might comment on this issue of independence, and I would ask all you gentlemen to do so. Could you please turn your microphone on?",Speech, 
"Mr. Mendelowitz","Yes. I have got it. I am a little rusty on this. It has been a while since I have been in this hearing room as a witness. Senator, you have highlighted--there are handfuls of critical things associated with the NIF proposal, and independence is one of those absolutely essential ones. If someone has the control over the purse of the NIF, they are not independent. If the NIF were to have to investigate its own actions, it certainly could not be unbiased. And so we feel very strongly that this is absolutely an essential component, and no matter how and where the institute is placed or structured, unless it has those absolutely essential independent safeguards, it cannot be effective. It is one of the reasons why we proposed that the Director of the NIF be a Presidential appointee, Senate confirmation, with a fixed term so that he or she would not serve at the pleasure of the President. And it is interesting because not only is this independence critical with respect to backward-looking on past decisions, it is actually also critical sort of going forward. One of the reasons why our proposal includes the fact that the NIF would not have any regulatory authority, except to set data standards and compel the provision of data, is the fact that if the NIF not only had to do the analysis and then act on the analysis, its ability to report clearly its findings would be compromised. The example I like to give is a provision in law that I was involved with a number of years ago which requires the Treasury Department to make an annual report to the Congress on foreign countries that manipulate their exchange rates for trade advantage. Now, those of us who at one time or another have followed this issue know that over the years a number of different countries have clearly manipulated their currencies for trade advantage. There is ample evidence. The most obvious example currently is the value of the Chinese RMB. And despite all the evidence that has been there, I do not believe the Treasury Department has ever been able to conclude in a report to Congress that any country was manipulating its exchange rate for foreign currency advantage. With the case of systemic regulation, I have to say that if a systemic regulator took the data and analysis and used it correctly and acted appropriately, that regulator would only be subject to criticism, because if he is successful, if she is successful, we would never see the next systemic event because it would have been prevented. But the actions of the regulator definitely will have taken some profits away from someone and slowed down the good times. If a systemic regulator--if the NIF had regulatory responsibilities, they would reach conclusions, the time would come to present the conclusions publicly, and I could just hear the sort of wheels turning in the minds of the Director, and he or she might say, ``Gee, I do not know. If we release this, I act on it, I am going to get a lot of criticism. Let us wait a little while and see what happens.'' So the answer is whether you are looking backward, whether you are looking forward, whether you are looking at budget issues, whether you are looking at the position of the Director of the institute, this issue of independence is central and critical to the ability of the institute to do its job.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Your comments sort of--there is a relationship with CBO that has a degree of independence from us that sometimes we appreciate and sometimes we disparage.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","But I believe that Director is appointed for a term of 5 years.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mendelowitz","Five years.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","And serves independent of us. They have proven that the last few months rather aggressively. I wonder if anyone else has a comment on independence. Professor?",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","I would be happy to. I will echo what Allan has said, what Dr. Mendelowitz has said, about in the importance in terms of political pressures that the institute is able to act in a way that it feels is in the best interest for the country. I have five reasons for being here: Joseph, Jacob, Sam, Matt, and Tom, my five boys. I want them to have a safe, secure financial system that gives them the same opportunity as I had when they grow up and get into the real world and start providing for a family. I think you need to have somebody who has the ability to speak the truth in the middle of a crisis or in the buildup to a crisis and can have the protection. There are really two roles that you think about in terms of systemic regulation. One is advisory, seeing and understanding the risks, and then speaking about them. The second one is the actual regulatory implementation, the different actions you might take in terms of how capital requirements--or how the institutions themselves are regulated. And I think it is very important to separate those two, and making the National Institute of Finance independent would do that. A second point that you want to consider in terms of why you want to keep the National Institute of Finance independent and why you want to also have somebody of high stature involved who is a Presidential appointee, who is going to be able to serve not at the will of the President but for a fixed term, is that if there is a crisis, again, that does happen and the National Institute of Finance is in place, all eyes will turn to the National Institute of Finance. And it needs to have absolute credibility. It needs in some sense to be like the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. When it speaks, it is not speaking because it has some political agenda or because it has to worry about whether its budget is going to be cut or not cut. It is speaking because it is trying to serve the best interests of the Nation.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I want to invite the other panelists to comment also, but one other factor that I think strikes me is that it goes to your point about surprise, and I thought the analogy with the hurricane of 1938 was--I will borrow it. It seems very compelling. But part of this was this was never seriously discussed at a national level--``this'' meaning the growing housing bubble, the national characteristics of it, the growing derivatives trade from a notional value of X to 200X. And as a result, it sort of got lost in the shuffle, and I think one of the purposes of having an agency like this is to get critical topics on the agenda of Congress and the regulators. Then it is our responsibility. But if you do not have an authoritative institution supported by data doing that, then the problem I think you will have is that the next time it will be something different. It will not be a housing bubble and subprime mortgages. It will be something we are not even thinking about, and it will come up. Regulators will talk about it. I am sure the Fed debated internally about the housing bubble. I am sure that the OCC and everybody did. But it never broke through because there was no one tasked with saying this is a serious systemic risk or should be considered at least at this juncture as such. So that is my two bits on the point. Dr. Engle, please, and then Mr. Horne.",Speech, 
"Mr. Engle","Well, I was just going to say I think an independent NIF would be very effective, but I think it could also be effective if it is within a systemic regulator, housed within a systemic regulator, because a systemic regulator has exactly the same target, has the same goals that you have both phrased, and it would, therefore, give more of a tool for understanding which data series need to be examined, which institutions can be ignored for the moment and would have to be studied later. Without having that being decided by the NIF itself, who would not--since it is responding to multiple regulatory inputs but no authority, would not actually be able to coordinate those decisions.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Dr. Horne?",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","Thank you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Go ahead.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","I appreciate it. Well, I think the words come to my mind, and it is probably words you have been hearing often over the past few months in particular, and those are the words ``moral dilemma.'' And I think this is what it is all about, and, again, my esteemed panelists here have brought up the concept of what I think is a moral dilemma. You know, if you are inside of an agency whose job is both to support the financial markets in terms of being directly involved in assisting them in growing and expanding and at the same time regulate them, there is a moral dilemma. If you are inside of an institution whose goal is to make as much profit as possible and at the same time you want to stick within regulatory bounds, you have a moral dilemma. So the issue that we have--and I can only speak for my company--is our goal is if we do not get the data right, we are dead in the water because people will stop buying our data. So our moral dilemma is getting the facts correct, and there is no dilemma. We either get it right or we get it wrong. And if we get it wrong, we are not in business very long. So part of the issue that I have is that I do believe that there is a need for an independent agency inside of the Government to deal with these issues without having to face the moral dilemma. I believe that there are issues that have to be faced by Congress, and it is going to take a little while for that to gel and come together. In the meanwhile, I do not think you can go and continue moving forward with the state of the economy as it is and the current what I call systemic bubbles that are occurring all across the country to continue to occur without having the information necessary to at least in the short term provide information above where you currently are today. And you are in very many cases at a point of stone chisels and knives, I might say, from a data standpoint, turning it into information in comparison to where the commercial market is and the commercial sector is in terms of managing their own information, although I have to say many of these companies, as was mentioned earlier, that I know of personally--because I worked with them in building some of these systems or trying to build some of these systems--are now all of a sudden spending hundreds of million dollars revamping their own internal risk management and analytic systems, including probably all of the top 20 banking and investment firm organizations, have incredible plans moving forward for building their own infrastructures, which in the long run the Government actions relative to what should be done in terms of capturing this data will probably improve their capabilities and, therefore, improve the trade of information and exchange between the two parties. But, again, I think you have a long-run situation where you need to get away from the moral dilemma. I think you have a short-run situation which is you have got to get the information in the hands of the people who can do something about it sooner rather than later, because there are other bubbles on the horizon that could pop, and unless you know that they are happening, unless you understand them, unless you address them, and unless you spend less money than just throwing it at the whole market, you spend it at the appropriate places, you are going to have greater pushback from the taxpayer in terms of being able to have the tools in your possession to be able to do the things that you want to do.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you. Senator Corker.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank each of you for outstanding testimony. There is something very appealing about the presentation which is--and we thank you for spending so much time in our personal office talking about it. I know Senator Reed feels the same way, I am sure. And then there is a piece of it that is almost kind of an eerie feeling. On the other hand, it is sort of the chaos of the market system and the companies you are talking about, Mr. Horne, investing that money to figure out ways of getting a tenth--just a little tenth of a point off, and they are taking advantage of anomalies that exist to make money, and I mean that in a positive way, OK? And then, on the other hand, we are talking about Professor Liechty creating models, if you will. You talk a little bit about NOAA, and NOAA is an interesting analogy except that NOAA is sort of talking about what is going to happen with the weather, and there is nothing you can do about it. I mean, it is just going to happen. On the other hand, you are talking about setting up models to keep anomalies or huge systemic risk occurrences from happening, and I guess how do you, when you are designing these models, keep yourself from sort of interfering from this chaos that can be positive or actually sort of creating self- fulfilling prophecies in some ways by virtue of the modeling that you set up?",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","That is an excellent question. It really is, because it comes to the heart of--this analogy does break down when you start thinking about the financial system because it is not a bunch of pressure systems and equations that you can model. It is just much more complicated than that. It is a game, really, is what you are thinking about, a very large- scale game. And I think if you borrow from the general scientific tradition, the first thing that you try to do in science is understand and explain. The second thing you try to do is predict. And then, finally, you see if you can have any level of control. It is kind of this progressive improvement that happens in your ability to gain scientific knowledge and understanding about a system. I am not sure how far we can go in terms of that path. I really--I am not certain because we haven't gone down that path in the research sense. But I think there are a lot of things you can borrow because it is a game, and if we begin to study it from a number of different perspectives and build a competing set of models. I want to just kind of echo what Governor Tarullo said and what Professor Engle said, is that you really do want--even to have this independent, you do want to have multiple people contributing to it. You can take, for example, kind of the hurricane modeling approach. There is not one model that is used to model hurricanes. When they start looking at hurricanes, they use a collection of competing models that then give them a multiple set of perspectives about how that hurricane is approaching and the impact. Now, would we potentially impact--I mean, would the National Institute of Finance or a systemic regulator potentially impact the path of the economy if they interceded in certain ways? That is a very hard question for me to answer. I am not sure. But I do believe that we can start to find answers to those kind of questions if we set up this kind of analysis. And we can at least, if we do no more than we do with the weather and begin to understand when there are really serious risks, when we learn how to potentially prepare ourselves better for those type of events that are occurring, then I think we will have made important progress in this arena.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","If you are setting up models, though, to try to ensure that a systemic risk does not occur and information is being made public, do you not automatically in some ways affect the economy or affect at least financial markets? I mean, how can you not do that if that information is being made public? It seems that is self-evident that that is going to occur.",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","Well, I think that for the large--when people approach the financial markets, they typically approach from the statistical perspective. Even though it is a whole bunch of individual agents interacting with each other, it is too complicated typically to really model effectively. There are some folks at Los Alamos and there is a really big simulation study over in Tokyo. I know there are IBMs involved with where they are trying to do Asian-based modeling. But typically, you have to sit back and look at aggregate summaries and model it from that perspective. Now, we have a lot of information that is already about the financial markets that is widely disseminated and we would be talking about adding additional information on top of that. I think where you start to begin to have problems or people begin to influence is if you have people all doing the same type of behaviors, so lots of people are making mortgage-backed securities and securitizing them and selling them off to pension fund, and there are lots of similar behaviors happening and then a shock comes through and everybody has to respond in a similar fashion. Then, in some sense, the model collapses down to a much simpler system because everyone is forced into a corner in the way they are going to have to behave. For the most part, I think giving more information and trying to model it is not going to have an impact, because I don't know that anybody is going to really have the ability to nudge the system one way or another. But what you hope you will find is when the system gets to a point where there, in essence, are bubbles that could be collapsing and what might trigger those bubbles, how you respond to that is going to be very carefully thought about, and is going to have to be very carefully thought about by the systemic regulator and the other regulators when they have that information. Do they want to talk to banks quietly? Do they want to make a public announcement? These are things that you are going to have to think very carefully about, and I am not prepared to lay the guidelines out right now.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So you are not really thinking about creating a world full of elevator music or anything. We would still have some degree of chaos in the marketplace.",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","Yes, sir. It would be very complicated.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","OK. Professor Engle, it sounds like you want to respond to this, and you are welcome to do that, but you also mentioned about making information available. Just for laymen like myself that obviously are at a whole different level as far as mathematic modeling and all that, what would be--for other Senators who might be tuned in, staffs or whatever--what would be the first three pieces of public information you think that might come out of an institute like this that would be helpful for people to know?",Speech, 
"Mr. Engle","Well, I think what I was going to say before is also related to this. The systemic regulator is going to have to use the incentives in the marketplace to achieve his goals. He is not going to be able to just legislate one thing or another, and our use of capital standards, capital controls, are ways of trying to nudge the institutions to take less risk or change their behavior in one way or another. Systemic taxes are very much designed to encourage institutions who have systemic risk to avoid the taxes by shedding the systemic risk if you can define and devise the systemic tax in exactly that way. The reason I think that making data public is useful is quite easily seen in the OTC derivatives market, where every time you enter a contract, you have a counterparty. And this counterparty has a risk that they will not perform. If the derivative turns out to have the value you want it to, then your counterparty may not perform. So we have to consider there being these extra risks, and it is very hard to assess the risk that your counterparty is going to be there if you don't know very much about what the counterparty is doing. So if we had more information on the health of counterparties, in other words, how much exposure they had to these same kinds of contracts, then the prices of the same deal with two different counterparties might not be the same. There would be a risk premium and you could decide whether you wanted to take the weak counterparty or the strong counterparty and you would get a different price in those contracts. That way, you would understand what risks you were taking and the weak counterparties would not be able to amass big positions. The poster child for this example is AIG, who, of course, wrote lots of credit default swaps but didn't have enough capital behind it, and investment bankers and final users bought a great deal of these contracts and insurance products without recognizing that actually they should have gotten a big discount on getting them because they weren't really so likely to pay off because AIG had such a big position. So if you could make public information on a basis which said, for each counterparty, how exposed is this counterparty-- how many positions does this counterparty have maybe a week ago on these kinds of contracts? This would give the market a way of evaluating the risk that they were taking with each counterparty. I think it would also encourage trades to move toward exchanges or centralized counterparty where you might not have to produce this information. So I think that the transparency has a dual role in this case. It would encourage the migration of products to centralized clearing, which is something that we think would reduce systemic risk, and it would allow investors to understand the risks and price the risks they are taking better and thereby both of these would reduce systemic risk.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Professor Liechty, I have two more questions.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Go right ahead.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Professor Liechty, how long would it take-- you know, we talked a little bit about this in the office, but let us say something like this became law in the summer of 2010. How long would it take before an entity like this was at least providing some of the basic information, not data, but information that would be useful to someone who is looking at systemic risk or other prudential regulators?",Speech, 
"Mr. Liechty","Sure. I am not an expert in this, but I have spoken to a number of folks who built up large institutions and teams of this nature. It does speak to the fact that you really want this institution to be an institution of very high stature. You want very high-quality individuals in this. To the extent you can build a world-class institution, it works in favor, I think, of all of us in the economy. The way you would start out, of course, is you would take existing data that is in the marketplace that you can find, pull together many of the ways that Steve is talking about, and augment that potentially with other types of reports you could require from the banks that would be fairly straightforward. I believe within 18 months to 2 years, you would be able to put together some preliminary, rudimentary maps of the entire system. You would be able to start seeing things like aggregation, some of the really simple low-hanging fruit. Everybody is heading in the same way in a trade, or someone has got outstanding positions that are really too large for that institution, like the AIG example. You would then, I believe, move yourself toward integrating counterparty information that is in the repositories, DTCC and the other clearinghouses, and I would see this being multi- stage, multi-year. So you would have a focus initially as to what can you get from the existing data and what science do we need and models do we need to build from that. You might be able to borrow from existing models and augment those. And then you will have another path, in my view, that would be doing longer-term, more sustained research. I would imagine that it would probably take somewhere, 6 to 8 years, in that timeframe, to see yourself walk all the way up to the full vision that we would see with a National Institute of Finance where you have a very fine-grained view of the entire counterparty network and be able to do large-scale simulations to understand how different types of shocks to the economy might work through that network and where the critical points of that network are and how they might have cascading failures or where you might see liquidity crises occur. But I would envision within 8, potentially 10 years, you would see a fully functioning institute, and certainly along the line you would see some very valuable information come out within shorter timeframes.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you very much, and go ahead, Mr. Horne.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","Yes, Senator, if I may add, I think the difference between what we are talking about here is mostly the fact that the NIF, I think--and again, this is my opinion, I am not going to speak on their behalf--but they are really talking about building a very structured approach toward managing risk, standing back and building models that can take all different sorts of views and all sorts of different looks at this problem and over periods of time be able to ascertain how to best approach these problems from an academic and regulatory approach. What we are trying to do, which is a little different, in the short-term and hopefully becomes a foundation or platform for what eventually the NIF is trying to do, and I don't know if the two pieces will ultimately fit together, but I do believe that we are extensible where that is a possibility, is that the data that is available right now today is capable of being integrated into a platform where regulators can start looking at the governance rules that are in place today and start figuring out, just as compensation analysts do, just as people who have to deal with the same problems. If you think about a compensation analyst inside of a large corporation, you have a huge sales force that is saying, OK, I am going to try to break every rule I possibly can so I can make the most money I possibly can, and I am not concerned about profit because it is not built into my compensation. Well, some portion of their compensation ends up having profit built into it. Then they say, well, wait a minute. I am not responsible for all the mechanisms that drive my product, so therefore maybe I shouldn't be responsible for profit. So you start getting into all these different types of analogies of how you should compensate people and how you should incent people to move forward. Well, the same issue is true in the financial markets. This moral dilemma that I brought up earlier is the same problem. You brought up the issue to Professor Engle about the fact, well, couldn't you--or to Professor Liechty--couldn't you actually influence what these markets do? And what I am thinking is it would be better to use the nearer-term, the shorter-term data that we are talking about now to try to help with some of the governance and regulatory rules to get people on the same path and same direction, and possibly those are things looking at specific pieces of law today that, you know, may be in conflict with systemic risk. The uptick law, for example, and I don't know how familiar you all are, but with shorting issues out there, you know, that could be a major driver of systemic risk. As a weighted value in a model, if you were to take that out and put that in, you may find that right off the bat, there is a factor there that maybe should be reconsidered relative to law. And what I am saying is from a governance perspective, if you have the information in the short-term to be able to do some of these things, then these models become incredibly valuable over time because they start really showing the dynamics and the interconnections and all the points of potential failure that can exist within the market. But in the near term, you have got to use some of the information that can be converted out of the data to figure out how to manage. And I am not talking about big government. I am not a big believer in big government. I am a believer in better government and better governance. And what I believe we have got right now is a lot of broad-stroke rules that don't allow for the surgical precision of attacking the problems where they exist. And with this information, you would have the ability to do so, and that is the difference between what we have today and what we could have. And by going through this process of cutting out certain things that make no sense whatsoever and maybe putting some governance back into the process, we could be on the same page so that the institutions and the government and the taxpayer are not facing the moral dilemma with each other.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I noticed Professor Mendelowitz.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mendelowitz","Thank you. I really would like to go back to one of the issues you raised a few minutes back about interfering in the market. We rely on markets, in this case financial markets, to allocate capital because they do it efficiently, and we know from history when other societies have tried to rely on command and control systems to do those kind of functions, they failed miserably. But for financial markets or any other kind of market to do its job, which is to allocate scarce resources efficiently, there have to be a number of conditions met that make it possible for the markets to do that, and as you well know, if they are not present, the markets can't. The challenge in financial markets is that it is clear, and this recent crisis is the most glaring example of it, financial markets are prone to the financial equivalent of sudden cardiac arrest, and I would like to take credit for that, but it wasn't my analogy. It was a professor at MIT who came up with it. And that government intervention was needed to deal with this equivalent of sudden cardiac arrest. Now, maybe extending the analogy is a bit much, but there was a time when if you suffered sudden cardiac arrest, there wasn't much the medical profession could do for you. Then we moved to a stage where there are some sort of dramatic interventions at the point of a heart attack. Until now we are at the situation where you stave off sudden cardiac arrest with long-term care. You take statins to lower cholesterol and vulnerability. You are more careful about what you eat. You exercise, a little bit healthier lifestyle. And you, in effect, are able to reduce the risk of the sudden cardiac arrest. What we are talking about with what the NIF can contribute is, in fact, the sort of financial market equivalent of a healthier lifestyle, to preserve the efficiencies that you get out of the financial markets.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you very much. I know I have gone on for a long time and I am sure you have a number of questions.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I don't. If you have additional questions, Bob, go ahead, please.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I have lots of questions. We spent a great deal of time with each of you and I have gotten a chance to know you, and I am sure that Courtney and Michael and Arlene and others will be talking with you over the course of the next week or so. I would ask, Mr. Horne, you mentioned you were looking at housing in North Carolina and Tennessee. I don't know for what reason. Maybe to purchase, I hope.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","But I wondered if you would tell me why and what you found. I wouldn't be a good Senator from Tennessee if I didn't ask.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","Well, I appreciate that, and I am sorry that I didn't put it into the rest of my speech, but I thought just putting it out there would bring a question about it. We look at leading indicators, and part of the issue that we have is that we have to look at these leading indicators today manually because they are in separate pieces of--or separate systems. So we look at the housing systems that we have access to and we have virtually every parcel of land in the country identified. And we know those that are in foreclosure. We know those that are underwater relative to the mortgages. And we understand those that are delinquent on their mortgage payments. One of the key ratios in North Carolina and Tennessee that are leading indicators to us is the 90-day delinquency rate on mortgage payments. Relative to the peers--although across the country, if you look at the chart, States like Nevada, Arizona, Florida have huge market viability from a--or market problems, market viability issues from being upside down in their mortgages. In Nevada, for example, seven out of ten homes are in negative value relative to the mortgages that exist for those properties. In Tennessee and in North Carolina, you are right around the national average. You are about 33 percent of the homes in your State and in North Carolina are right around the national average. But relative to your peers, the 90-day delinquency rate over the last 3 months has increased dramatically, OK. So that shows me that there is a leading indicator out there that says that people are not able to pay their mortgages. So I start with that one. Then I look at plant closings and failures and shifts in unemployment. Now, it doesn't mean the unemployment rolls immediately go up, but it shows me as a leading indicator that there is going to be a possibility that the unemployment rolls are going to go up. So I start looking at that as a leading indicator to unemployment. Then I look at bankruptcy and I start looking in the retail sector, in particular. And I think you heard from the Congressional Oversight Panel, or at least if you were able to read any of the report, that commercial failure particularly in the retail sector is up, and that is also a leading indicator of the potential of people not having available cash because they are either temporarily or potentially for long-term unemployed and therefore start becoming delinquent on bills such as their mortgages. We don't have the database built yet, so I can't just run a model and 20 seconds later come up with every county or every Congressional district in the State of Tennessee and tell you exactly what the combination of those factors in that model would tell us in terms of the potential for systemic risk or failure of any of those given markets. But I can tell you from leading indicators that these are pieces of information that are telling me that there are potentials for problems out there, and particularly the 90-day delinquency risk factor, which is one of the ones that we weight relatively heavily relative to some of the other factors, is a leading indicator that is telling us people are having a difficult time paying their bills. And so that is why I bring that up and that is why I say in those two States, because relative to other States who are in the same range of being underwater on their properties, don't have the same delinquency rate problems that those two States are currently facing.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Well, thank you. I almost wish I didn't ask, but thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","I am sorry.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I will say this, though. That example, I think, Senator Reed--first of all, I want to thank you again for your leadership on this and trying to figure out a solution on the derivatives side. I think, though, that answer, irrespective of the not-good news that is relayed there, is an indication of some of the kinds of data that one might generate and could, in fact, be useful, even though I know you are looking at different types of financial instruments. I appreciate that explanation and I thank you so much for your generosity of time, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Certainly, Senator. Thank you for your leadership on this and so many other issues involved in banking and other challenges facing the country. I don't want to ask any more questions about specific localities, Mr. Horne.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I don't mean to be disrespectful, but given your access to all this data, when did you and your colleagues first get the sense that there was a national housing problem?",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","I have known that there has been a national housing problem since the first time that our partners--we have over 900 data partners that we work with. One of our largest data partners is First American CoreLogic, which is the largest collector of deed, tax, and mortgage roll property information in the country. So when I started analyzing their data and combining it with Dow Jones information about the individual market segments and the tremendous volumes--I mean, we collect terabytes and terabytes of information--and start looking at the various factors that we call trigger events--these are things that occur that show an action taking place that is either positive or potentially adverse actions--we saw this occurring, frankly, before 2007. We actually saw the bubble before the bubble and could tell some of these things were starting to happen. The problem, again, is this is macro data. When they roll it up and look at it, they usually look at it within the housing market, within the specific segment of the database that they have, and we haven't brought it together with our unemployment findings, with our bankruptcy findings, with our commercial real estate information to separate it from the residential real estate information. And this disaggregation of information in these individual silos prevent us from being able to do, except through very extensive manual efforts, the ability to bring this data together in a way so we actually can build real models on the symbiosis, the systemic issues that are occurring between all these different factors in the marketplace. The systemic issues that occur within an institution and institutions, which I think we are talking about here, between the majors, the Citicorps, the JPMorgans, the AIGs, are extensive and we understand that they are very complex and the counterparty risks there are very difficult to track, particularly if you don't have access to all of the other pieces of information. Now, we have large amounts of information regarding derivative data, regarding all sorts of different kinds of financial instruments, but it is only segments of the market. We don't have all of it because not all of it is available, even in public or private data. So part of the issue here is the investment that needs to be done to actually build the database.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, I don't--we have taken a great deal of your time and it has been extremely valuable, so thank you. But I don't sense there is a mutually exclusive sort of agenda here. I think we are talking about the same thing, which is building in the short term an information gathering and an analytical capability that will help us, but in the longer term, getting to the point where it is just not prediction, there might be even some treatment involved, which is the point you made. Dr. Mendelowitz, a final point.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mendelowitz","Yes, Senator. This discussion about the housing bubble, I think, gives us an insight into what the need for the NIF is. While Steve said back in 2007 he saw it, those of you--but basically 5 years ago, I started predicting a major credit event in the housing sector that was going to push the economy into the worst recession since the Second World War, and it was really just based upon looking at relatively small data sets that went to what was happening to housing prices, what was happening to household income, and what was happening on the delinquency and default rate on mortgages, all of which was readily available data. So it was easy to predict a major credit event in housing and it was easy to predict, because of the widespread nature of home ownership, that this was going to lead to a recession that was going to be driven by falling consumption. That was the easy piece of it. Now we are saying the fact the Fed didn't see it, because they were using the standard monetarist model, and if you can't see something with the monetarist model, you don't see it. But what I didn't see and couldn't see and couldn't understand was how what was happening in the housing sector was going to lead to the collapse in the financial sector. And it is the kind of data that we are talking about the NIF collecting that would provide that insight, and there is no substitute for that. There is no alternative. There is no shortcut. Because at the end of the day, you have to know where the concentrations of risks are and you have to know what the nature of the intertwined network of financial firms and their obligations are, because it is the combination of concentrations of risk and the exposure of the network that can produce a domino effect of multiple failures that creates a systemic risk. And so it is one thing to see a macroeconomic crisis tied to something like housing. It is something entirely different-- the data needs are entirely different when it comes to understanding the systemic risk that flows from those concentrations of risk.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I want to thank you all for excellent testimony, thought provoking, and also for your advancing this issue. I think we leave here with, one, we need better data. We need better analysis. And if we don't achieve it in the next several months, the bubbles that might be out there percolating, if that is the right term, will once again catch us by surprise and we shouldn't let that happen. But thank you all very, very much. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Mendelowitz","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Horne","Thank you, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","The hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
