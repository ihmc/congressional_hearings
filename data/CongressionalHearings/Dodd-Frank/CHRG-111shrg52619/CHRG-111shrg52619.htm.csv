"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. Senator Shelby is in his office. He will be along shortly but asked us to commence the hearing. So we will begin this morning. Let me welcome my colleagues, welcome our witnesses as well. We have another long table here this morning of witnesses, and we are trying to move through this series of hearings on the modernization of financial regulation. So I am very grateful to all of you for your testimony. The testimony is lengthy, I might add. Going through last evening the comments--there is Senator Shelby. Very, very helpful, though, and very informative testimony, so we thank you all for your contribution. I will open up with some comments. I will turn to Senator Shelby, and then we will get right to our witnesses. We have got votes this morning as well, I would notify my colleagues, coming up so we are going to have to stagger this a bit so we do not delay the hearing too long, and we will try to, each one of us, go out and vote and come back so we can continue the hearing uninterrupted, if that would work out. So I will ask my colleagues' indulgence in that regard as well. We are gathering here again this morning to discuss the modernization of bank supervision and regulation. This hearing marks yet another in a series of hearings to identify causes of the financial crisis and specific responses that will guide this Committee's formulation of a new architecture for the 21st century financial services regulation. Today, we are going to explore ways to modernize and improve bank regulation and supervision, to protect consumers and investors, and help grow our economy in the decades ahead. A year ago, this Committee heard from witnesses on two separate occasions that the banking system was sound and that the vast majority of banks would be well positioned to weather the storm. A year later, taxpayers are forced to pump billions of dollars into our major banking institutions to keep them afloat. Meanwhile, every day 20,000 people, we are told, are losing their jobs in our country, 10,000 families' homes are in jeopardy from foreclosure, and credit--the lifeblood of our economy--is frozen solid. People are furious right now, and they should be. But history will judge whether we make the right decisions. And as President Obama told the Congress last month, we cannot afford to govern out of anger or yield to the politics of the moment as we prepare to make choices that will shape the future of our country literally for decades and decades to come. We must learn from the mistakes and draw upon those lessons to shape the new framework for financial services regulation, an integrated, transparent, and comprehensive architecture that serves the American people well through the 21st century. Instead of the race to the bottom we saw in the run-up to the crisis, I want to see a race to the top, with clear lines of authority, strong checks and balances that build the confidence in our financial system that is so essential to our economic growth and stability. Certainly there is a case to be made for a so-called systemic risk regulator within that framework, and whether or not those vast powers will reside in the Fed remains an open question, although the news this morning would indicate that maybe a far more open question in light of the balance sheet responsibilities. And, Mr. Tarullo, we will be asking you about that question this morning to some degree as well. This news this morning adds yet additional labors and burdens on the Fed itself, and so the question of whether or not, in addition to that job, we can also take on a systemic risk supervisor capacity is an issue that I think a lot of us will want to explore. As Chairman Bernanke recently said, the role of the systemic risk regulator will entail a great deal of expertise, analytical sophistication, and the capacity to process large amounts of disparate information. I agree with Chairman Bernanke, which is why I wonder whether it would not make more sense to give authority to resolve failing and systemically important institutions to the agency with actual experience in the area--the FDIC. If the events of this week have taught us anything, it is that the unwinding of these institutions can sap both public dollars and public confidence essential to getting our economy back on track. This underscores the importance of establishing a mechanism to resolve these failing institutions. From its failure to protect consumers, to regulate mortgage lending, to effectively oversee bank holding companies, the instances in which the Fed has failed to execute its existing authority are numerous. In a crisis that has taught the American people many hard learned lessons, perhaps the most important is that no institution should ever be too big to fail. And going forward, we should consider how that lesson applies not only to our financial institutions, but also to the Government entities charged with regulating them. Replacing Citibank-size financial institutions with Citibank-size regulators would be a grave mistake. This crisis has illustrated all too well the dangers posed to the consumer and our economy when we consolidate too much power in too few hands with too little transparency and accountability. Further, as former Fed Chairman Volcker has suggested, there may well be an inherent conflict of interest between prudential supervision--that is, the day-to-day regulation of our banks--and monetary policy, the Fed's primary mission--and an essential one, I might add. One idea that has been suggested that could complement and support an entity that oversees systemic risk is a consolidated safety and soundness regulator. The regulatory arbitrage, duplication, and inefficiency that comes with having multiple Federal banking regulators was at least as much of a problem in creating this crisis as the Fed's inability to see the crisis coming and its failure to protect consumers and investors. And so systemic risk is important, but no more so than the risk to consumers and depositors, the engine behind our very banking system. Creating that race to the top starts with building from the bottom up. That is why I am equally interested in what we do to the prudential supervision level to empower regulators, the first line of defense for consumers and depositors, and increase the transparency that is absolutely essential to checks and balances and to a healthy financial system. Each of these issues leads us to a simple conclusion: The need for broad, comprehensive reform is clear. We cannot afford to address the future of our financial system piecemeal or ad hoc without considering the role that every actor at every level must play in creating a stable banking system that helps our economy grow for decades to come. That must be our collective goal. With that, let me turn to Senator Shelby.",Speech, 
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. We are in the midst of an unprecedented financial crisis. I believe the challenge before us involves three tasks: First, we must work to stabilize the system. Second, we must understand the origins of the current crisis. And, third, we must work to restructure our regulatory regime to meet the demands of a 21st century financial system. Today, the Committee will focus primarily on the third task, rebuilding the regulatory structure. I believe the success of our effort will depend a great deal on our ability to determine what led us to this point. Without that knowledge, we will not know whether we are regulating the right things in the right way. We need to determine whether the regulators had sufficient authority and whether they used the authority they had to the fullest extent. We need to consider here whether market developments outpace current regulatory capabilities. We also need to better understand the impact regulation has on the private sector's due diligence and risk management practices. After understanding the nature of the regulatory structure, I believe we need to come to an understanding as to the specific cause or causes of the regulatory failure. We then need to address those failures in such a manner where we create a durable, flexible, and robust regime that can grow with markets while still protecting consumers and market stability. This is a very tall order. It will take an intensive and extended effort on our behalf, but in the end, getting this thing done right is more important than getting it done quickly.

We are very fortunate to have a good, strong group of folks who know these issues well and have been involved before with this Committee on numerous occasions. Let me briefly introduce them each. I will begin with John Dugan. He is currently the Comptroller of the Currency. We thank you for coming back before the Committee once again. Sheila Bair, Chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, has been before the Committee on numerous occasions. We have next Michael Fryzel, Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, and we appreciate your participation. Dan Tarullo is with the Federal Reserve. We thank you, Dan. Congratulations on your recent confirmation as well. Scott Polakoff currently serves as the Acting Director of the Office of Thrift Supervision. Joseph Smith is currently North Carolina Commissioner on Banks and is appearing on behalf of the State Bank Supervisors, and we thank you for being here. And George Reynolds is the Chairman of the National Association of State Credit Union Supervisors and Senior Deputy Commissioner of the Georgia Department of Banking and Finance. And we thank you as well for joining us. I am going to ask, given the magnitude, the size of our Committee here this morning--I noticed, for instance, John, your testimony is about 18 or 20 pages long last night as I went through it, and I am hopeful you are not going to try and do all 20 pages here this morning. Dan, yours is about 16 or 17 pages as well. If you could abbreviate this down to about 5 or 6 minutes or so--and it is important we hear what you have to say, so I do not want to constrain you too much. But I would like to be able to get through everyone so we can go through the question period. We will begin with you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Thank you, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. The financial crisis has raised legitimate questions about whether we need to restructure and reform our financial regulatory system, and I welcome the opportunity to testify on this important subject on behalf of the OCC. Let me summarize the five key recommendations from my written statement which address issues raised in the Committee's letter of invitation. First, we support the establishment of a systemic risk regulator, which probably should be the Federal Reserve Board. In many ways, the Board already serves this role with respect to systemically important banks, but no agency has had similar authority with respect to systemically important financial institutions that are not banks, which created real problems in the last several years as risk increased in many such institutions. It makes sense to provide one agency with authority and accountability for identifying and addressing such risks across the financial system. This authority should be crafted carefully, however, to address the very real concerns of the Board taking on too many functions to do all of them well, while at the same time concentrating too much authority in a single Government agency. Second, we support the establishment of a regime to stabilize resolve and wind down systemically significant firms that are not banks. The lack of such a regime this past year proved to be an enormous problem in dealing with distressed and failing institutions such as Bear Stearns, Lehman Brothers, and AIG. The new regime should provide tools that are similar to those the FDIC currently has for resolving banks, as well as provide a significant funding source, if needed, to facilitate orderly dispositions, such as a significant line of credit from the Treasury. In view of the systemic nature of such resolutions and the likely need for Government funding, the systemic risk regulator and the Treasury Department should be responsible for this new authority. Third, if the Committee decides to move forward with reducing the number of bank regulators--and that would, of course, shorten this hearing--we have two general recommendations. The first may not surprise you. We believe strongly that you should preserve the role of a dedicated prudential banking supervisor that has no job other than bank supervision. Dedicated supervision produces no confusion about the supervisor's goals or mission, no potential conflict with competing objectives; responsibility and accountability are well defined; and the result is a strong culture that fosters the development of the type of seasoned supervisors that we need. But my second recommendation here may sound a little strange coming from the OCC given our normal turf wars. Congress, I believe, should preserve a supervisory role for the Federal Reserve Board, given its substantial experience with respect to capital markets, payment systems, and the discount window. Fourth, Congress should establish a system of national standards that are uniformly implemented for mortgage regulation. While there were problems with mortgage underwriting standards at all mortgage providers, including national banks, they were least pronounced at regulated banks, whether State or nationally chartered. But they were extremely severe at the nonbank mortgage companies and mortgage brokers regulated exclusively by the States, accounting for a disproportionate share of foreclosures. Let me emphasize that this was not the result of national bank preemption, which in no way impeded States from regulating these providers. National mortgage standards with comparable implementation by Federal and State regulators would address this regulatory gap and ensure better mortgages for all consumers. Finally, the OCC believes the best way to implement consumer protection regulation of banks, the best way to protect consumers is to do so through prudential supervision. Supervisors' continual presence in banks through the examination process creates especially effective incentives for consumer protection compliance, as well as allowing examiners to detect compliance failures much earlier than would otherwise be the case. They also have strong enforcement powers and exceptional leverage over bank management to achieve corrective action. That is, when examiners detect consumer compliance weaknesses or failures, they have a broad range of corrective tools from informal comments to formal enforcement action, and banks have strong incentives to move back into compliance as expeditiously as possible. Finally, because examiners are continually exposed to the practical effects of implementing consumer protection rules for bank customers, the prudential supervisory agency is in the best position to formulate and refine consumer protection regulation for banks. Proposals to remove consumer protection regulation and supervision from prudential supervisors, instead consolidating such authority in a new Federal agency, would lose these very real benefits, we believe. If Congress believes that the consumer protection regime needs to be strengthened, the best answer is not to create a new agency that would have none of the benefits of the prudential supervisor. Instead, we believe the better approach is for Congress to reinforce the agency's consumer protection mission and direct them to toughen the applicable standards and close any gaps in regulatory coverage. The OCC and the other prudential bank supervisors will rigorously apply any new standards, and consumers will be better protected. Thank you very much. I would be happy to answer questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF JOHN C. DUGAN, COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY, OFFICE OF THE COMPTROLLER OF THE CURRENCY 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Ms. Bair, thank you for joining us.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, thank you for the opportunity to testify today. Our current regulatory system has clearly failed in many ways to manage risk properly and to provide market stability. While it is true that there are regulatory gaps which need to be plugged, U.S. regulators already have broad powers to supervise financial institutions. We also have the authority to limit many of the activities that undermined our financial system. The plain truth is that many of the systemically significant companies that have needed unprecedented Federal help were already subject to extensive Federal oversight. Thus, the failure to use existing authorities by regulators casts doubt on whether simply entrusting power in a new systemic risk regulator would be enough. I believe the way to reduce systemic risk is by addressing the size, complexity, and concentration of our financial institutions. In short, we need to end ``too big to fail.'' We need to create regulatory and economic disincentives for systemically important financial firms. For example, we need to impose higher capital requirements on them in recognition of their systemic importance to make sure they have adequate capital buffers in times of stress. We need greater market discipline by creating a clear, legal mechanism for resolving large institutions in an orderly manner that is similar to the one for FDIC-insured banks. The ad hoc response to the current crisis is due in large part to the lack of a legal framework for taking over an entire complex financial organization. As we saw with Lehman Brothers, bankruptcy is a very poor way to resolve large, complex financial organizations. We need a special process that is outside bankruptcy, just as we have for commercial banks and thrifts. To protect taxpayers, a new resolution regime should be funded by fees charged to systemically important firms and would apply to any institution that puts the system at risk. These fees could be imposed on a sliding scale, so the greater the risk the higher the fee. In a new regime, rules and responsibility must be clearly spelled out to prevent conflicts of interest. For example, Congress gave the FDIC back-up supervisory authority and the power to self-appoint as receiver when banks get into trouble. Congress did this to ensure that the entity resolving a bank has the power to effectively exercise its authority even if there is disagreement with the primary supervisor. As Congress has determined for the FDIC, any new resolution authority should also be independent of any new systemic risk regulator. The FDIC's current authority to act as receiver and to set up a bridge bank to maintain key functions and sell assets is a good starting point for designing a new resolution regime. There should be a clearly defined priority structure for settling claims depending on the type of firm. Any resolution should be required to minimize losses to the public. And the claims process should follow an established priority list. Also, no single Government entity should have the power to deviate from the new regime. It should include checks and balances that are similar to the systemic risk exception for the least cost test that now applies to FDIC-insured institutions. Finally, the resolution entity should have the kinds of powers the FDIC has to deal with such things as executive compensation. When we take over a bank, we have the power to hire and fire. We typically get rid of the top executives and the managers who caused the problem. We can terminate compensation agreements, including bonuses. We do whatever it takes to hold down costs. These types of authorities should apply to any institution that gets taken over by the Government. Finally, there can no longer be any doubt about the link between protecting consumers from abusive products and practices and the safety and soundness of America's financial system. It is absolutely essential that we set uniform standards for financial products. It should not matter who the seller is, be it a bank or nonbank. We also need to make sure that whichever Federal agency is overseeing consumer protection, it has the ability to fully leverage the expertise and resources accumulated by the Federal banking agencies. To be effective, consumer policy must be closely coordinated and reflect a deep understanding of financial institutions and the dynamic nature of the industry as a whole. The benefits of capitalism can only be recognized if markets reward the well managed and punish the lax. However, this fundamental principle is now observed only with regard to smaller financial institutions. Because of the lack of a legal mechanism to resolve the so-called systemically important, regardless of past inefficiency or recklessness, nonviable institutions survive with the support of taxpayer funds. History has shown that Government policies should promote, not hamper, the closing and/or restructuring of weak institutions into stronger, more efficient ones. The creation of a systemic risk regulator could be counterproductive if it reinforced the notion that financial behemoths designated as systemic are, in fact, too big to fail. Congress' first priority should be the development of a framework which creates disincentives to size and complexity and establishes a resolution mechanism which makes clear that managers, shareholders, and creditors will bear the consequences of their actions.

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech, 
"Mr. Fryzel","Thank you, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee. As Chairman of the National Credit Union Administration, I appreciate this opportunity to provide the agency's position on regulatory modernization. Federally insured credit unions comprise a small but important part of the financial institution community, and I hope NCUA's perspective on this matter will add to the understanding of the unique characteristics of the credit union industry and the 90 million members they serve. The market dislocations underscore the importance of your review of this subject. I see a need for revisions to the current regulatory structure in ways that would improve Federal oversight of not just financial institutions, but the entire financial services market. My belief is that there is a better way forward, a way that would enable Federal regulators to more quickly and effectively identify and deal with developing problems. Before I express my views on possible reforms, I want to briefly update you on the condition of the credit union industry. Overall, credit unions maintained reasonable performance in 2008. Aggregate capital level finished the year at 10.92 percent, and while earnings decreased due to the economic downturn, credit unions still posted a 0.30 percent return on assets in 2008. I am pleased to report that even in the face of market difficulties, credit unions were able to increase lending by just over 7 percent. Loan delinquencies were 1.3 percent, and charge-offs were 0.8 percent, indicating that credit unions are lending prudently. Credit unions are fundamentally different in structure and operation than other types of financial institutions. They are not-for-profit cooperatives owned and governed by their members. Our strong belief is that these unique and distinct institutions require unique and distinct regulation, accompanied by supervision tailored to their special way of operating. Independent NCUA regulation has enabled credit unions to perform in a safe and sound manner while fulfilling the cooperative mandate set forth by Congress. One benefit of our distinct regulatory approach is the 18-percent usury ceiling for Federal credit unions that enhances their ability to act a low-cost alternative to predatory lenders. Another is the existence of a supervisory committee for Federal charters, unique among all financial institutions. These committees, comprised of credit union members, have enhanced consumer protection by giving members peer review of complaints and have supplemented the ability of NCUA to resolve possible violations of consumer protection laws. NCUA administers the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, the Federal insurance fund for both Federal and State- chartered credit unions. The fund currently has an equity ratio of 1.28 percent. The unique structure of the fund where credit unions make a deposit equal to 1 percent of their insured shares, augmented by premiums as needed, to keep the fund above a statutory level of 1.20 percent has resulted in a very stable and well-functioning insurance fund. Even in the face of significant stress in the corporate credit union part of the industry, stress that necessitated extraordinary actions by the NCUA board to stabilize the corporates, the fund has proven durable. I want to underscore the benefits of having the fund administered by NCUA. Working in concert with our partners in the State regulatory system, NCUA uses close supervision to control risks. This concept was noted prudently by GAO studies over the years, as were the benefits of a streamlined oversight and insurance function under one roof. This consolidated approach has enabled NCUA to manage risk in an efficient manner and identify problems in a way that minimizes losses to the fund. NCUA considers the totality of our approach for mixed deposit and premium funding mechanism to unify supervisory and insurance activities, to be the one that has had significant public policy benefits, and one worth preserving. Whatever reorganization Congress contemplates, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund should remain integrated into the Federal credit union regulator and separate from any other Federal insurance funds. Regarding restructuring of the financial regulatory framework, I suggest creating a single oversight entity whose responsibilities would include monitoring financial institution regulators and issuing principles-based regulations and guidance. The entity would be responsible for establishing general safety and soundness standards, while the individual regulators would enforce them in the institutions they regulated. It would also monitor systemic risks across institution types. Again, for this structure to be effective for federally insured credit unions and the consumers they serve, the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund should remain independent in order to maintain the dual NCUA regulatory and insurance roles that have been tested and proven to work for almost 40 years. I appreciate the opportunity to provide testimony today and would be pleased to answer any questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF MICHAEL E. FRYZEL, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL CREDIT UNION ADMINISTRATION 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very, very much. Dan Tarullo, thank you very much for being here on behalf of the Fed.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee. We are here this morning because of systemic risk. We have had a systemic crisis. We are still in the middle of it, and I would endorse wholeheartedly Senator Shelby's three-part approach to responding to that crisis. In the weeks that I have been at the Federal Reserve, the discussions that have taken place internally, both among staff and among the members, have focused on the issue of systemic risk and how to prevent it going forward. The important point I would make as a prelude to our recommendations is that the source of systemic risk in our financial system has to some considerable extent migrated from traditional banking activities to markets over the last 20 or 25 years. If you think about the problems that led to the Depression, that were apparent even in the 1970s among some banks, the concern was that there would be a run on a bank, that depositors would be worried about the safety and soundness of that bank and that there would be contagion spreading to other institutions as depositors were uncertain as to the status of those institutions. What has been seen more recently is a systemic problem starting in the interactions among institutions in markets. Now, banks are participants in markets, so this can still be something that affects banks. But we have also seen other kinds of institutions at the source of the systemic problems we are undergoing right now. I think you cannot focus on a single institution or even just look at institutions as a series of silos, as it were, and concentrate solely on trying to assure their safety and soundness. We need to look at the interaction among institutions. Sometimes that means their actual counterparty relationships with one another. Sometimes it means the fora in which they interact with one another, in payment systems and the like. Sometimes it even means the parallel strategies which they may be pursuing--when, for example, they are all relying on the same sources of liquidity if they have to change their investing strategies. So they may not even know that they are co-dependent with other actors in the financial markets. For all of these reasons, our view is that the focus needs to be on an agenda for financial stability, an agenda for systemic risk management. I emphasize that because, although there is rightly talk about a systemic risk regulator, it is important that we understand each component of an agenda which is going to be fulfilled by all the financial regulators over which you have jurisdiction. So what do we mean by this agenda? Well, I tried in my testimony to lay out five areas in which we should pay attention. First, we do need effective consolidated supervision of any systemically important institution. We need consolidated supervision and it needs to be effective. There are institutions that are systemically important, and certainly were systemically important over the last few years, which were not subject to consolidated prudential supervision by any regulator. But that supervision needs to be effective. I think everybody is aware, and ought to be aware, of the ways in which the regulation and supervision of our financial institutions in recent years has fallen short. And unless, as Senator Shelby suggests, we all concentrate on it and reflect on it without defensiveness, we are not going to learn the lessons that need to be learned. Second, there is need for a resolution mechanism. I am happy to talk about that in the back and forth with you, but Comptroller Dugan and Chairman Bair have laid that out very well. Third, there does need to be more oversight of key areas in which market participants interact in important ways. We have focused in particular on payments and settlement systems, because there the Fed's oversight authority derives largely from the coincidence that some of the key actors happen to be member banks. But if they weren't, if they had another corporate form, there is no statutory authority right now for us to exercise prudential supervision over those markets in which problems can arise. Fourth, consumer protection. Now, consumer protection is not and should not be limited to its relationship with potential systemic risk. But, as the current crisis demonstrated, there are times in which good consumer protection is not just good consumer protection, but it is an important component of an agenda for containment of systemic risk. Fifth and finally is the issue of a systemic risk regulator. This is something that does seem to fit into an overall agenda. There are gaps in covering systemically important institutions. There are also gaps in attempting to monitor what is going on across the system. I think in the past there have been times at which there was important information being developed by various regulators and supervisors which, if aggregated, would have suggested developing issues and problems. But without a charge to one or more entities to try to put all that together, one risks looking at things, as I said, in a more siloed fashion. The extent of those authorities for a systemic risk regulator is something that needs to be debated in this Committee and in the entire Congress. But I do think that it is an important complement to the other components of this agenda and the improvements in supervision and regulation under existing authorities, and thus something that ought to be considered. I am happy to answer any questions that you may have.",Statement,STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM

"Mr. Polakoff","Good morning, Chairman Dodd. Thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of OTS on ``Modernizing Bank Supervision and Regulation.'' As you know, our current system of financial supervision is a patchwork with pieces that date back to the Civil War. If we were to start from scratch, no one would advocate establishing a system like the one we have, cobbled together over the last century and a half. The complexity of our financial markets has in some cases reached mind-boggling proportions. To effectively address the risks in today's financial marketplace, we need a modern, sophisticated system of regulation and supervision that applies evenly across the financial services landscape. Our current economic crisis enforces the message that the time is right for an in-depth, careful review and meaningful, fundamental change. Any restructuring should take into account the lessons learned from this crisis. At the same time, the OTS recommendations that I am presenting here today do not represent a realignment of the current regulatory structure. Rather, they represent a fresh start using a clean slate. They represent the OTS vision for the way financial services regulation in this country should be. In short, we are proposing fundamental changes that would affect virtually all of the current financial regulators. It is important to note that these are high-level recommendations. Before adoption and implementation, many details would need to be worked out and many questions would need to be answered. The OTS proposal for modernization has two basic elements. First, a set of guiding principles, and second, recommendations for Federal bank regulation, holding company supervision, and systemic risk regulation. So what I would like to do is offer the five guiding principles. Number one, a dual banking system with Federal and State charters for banks. Number two, a dual insurance system with Federal and State charters for insurance companies. Number three, the institution's operating strategy and business model would determine its charter and identify its responsible regulatory agency. Institutions would not simply pick their regulator. Number four, organizational and ownership options would continue, including mutual ownership, public and private stock entities, and Subchapter S corporations. And number five, ensure that all entities offering financial products are subject to the consistent laws, regulations, and rigor of regulatory oversight. Regarding our recommendations on regulatory structure, the OTS strongly supports the creation of a systemic risk regulator with authority and resources to accomplish the following three functions. Number one, to examine the entire conglomerate. Number two, to provide temporary liquidity in a crisis. And number three, to process a receivership if failure is unavoidable. For Federal bank regulation, the OTS proposes two charters, one for banks predominately focused on consumer and community banking products, including lending, and the other for banks primarily focused on commercial products and services. The business models of the commercial bank and the consumer and community bank are fundamentally different enough to warrant two distinct Federal banking charters. These regulators would each be the primary Federal supervisor for State chartered banks with the relevant business models. A consumer and community bank regulator would close the gaps in regulatory oversight that led to a shadow banking system of uneven regulated mortgage companies, brokers, and consumer lenders that were significant causes of the current crisis. This regulator would also be responsible for developing and implementing all consumer protection requirements and regulations. Regarding holding companies, the functional regulator of the largest entity within a diversified financial company would be the holding company regulator.

"Chairman Dodd","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","I would like to emphasize a few points that are contained in it. The first of these points is that proximity, or closeness to the consumers, businesses, and communities that deal with our banks is important. We acknowledge that a modern financial regulatory structure must deal with systemic risks presented by complex global institutions. While this is necessary, sir, we would argue that it is not itself sufficient. A modern financial regulatory structure should also include, and as more than an afterthought, the community and regional institutions that are not systemically significant in terms of risk but that are crucial to effectively serving the diverse needs of our very diverse country. These institutions were organized to meet local needs and have grown as they have met such needs, both in our metropolitan markets and in rural and exurban markets, as well. We would further suggest that the proximity of State regulators and attorneys general to the marketplace is a valuable asset in our efforts to protect consumers from fraud, predatory conduct, and other abuses. State officials are the first responders in the area of consumer protection because they are the nearest to the action and see the problems first. It is our hope that a modernized regulatory system will make use of the valuable market information that the States can provide in setting standards of conduct and will enhance the role of States in enforcing such standards. To allow for this system to properly function, we strongly believe that Congress should overturn or roll back the OTS and OCC preemption of State consumer protection laws and State enforcement. A second and related point that we hope you will consider is that the diversity of our banking and regulatory systems is a strength of each. One size does not fit all, either with regard to the size, scope, and business methods of our banks or the regulatory regime applicable to them. We are particularly concerned that in addressing the problems of complex global institutions, a modernized financial system may inadvertently weaken community and regional banks by under-support for the larger institutions and by burdening smaller institutions with the costs of regulation that are appropriate for the large institutions, but not for the smaller regional ones. We hope you agree with us that community and regional banks provide needed competition in our metropolitan markets and crucial financial services in our smaller and more isolated markets. A corollary of this view is that the type of regulatory regime that is appropriate for complex global organizations is not appropriate for community and regional banks. In our view, the time has come for supervision and regulation that is tailored to the size, scope, and complexity of a regulated enterprise. One size should not and cannot be made to fit all. I would like to make it clear that my colleagues and I are not arguing for preservation of the status quo. Rather, we are suggesting that a modernized regulatory system should include a cooperative federalism that incorporates both national standards for all market participants and shared responsibility for the development and enforcement of such standards. We would submit that the shared responsibility for supervising State charter banks is one example, current example, of cooperative federalism and that the developing partnership between State and Federal regulators under the Secure and Fair Enforcement for mortgage licensing, or SAFE Act, is another. Chairman Dodd, my colleagues and I support this Committee's efforts to modernize our Nation's financial regulatory system. As always, sir, it is an honor to appear before you. I hope that our testimony is of assistance to the Committee and would be happy to answer any questions you may have. Thank you very, very much.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Smith. We don't say this often enough in the Committee. The tendency today is to use the word ``bank,'' and I am worried about it becoming pejorative. There are 8,000 banks and I think there are 20--Governor Tarullo can correct me on this--that control about 70 to 80 percent of all the deposits in the country. The remaining 7,000-plus are regional or community banks. They do a terrific job and have been doing a great job. And the tendency to talk about lending institutions in broad terms is not fair to a lot of those institutions which have been very prudent in their behavior over the last number of years and it is important we recognize that from this side of the dais. And so your comments are appreciated.",Speech, 
"Mr. Reynolds","Chairman Dodd, I appear today on behalf of NASCUS, the professional association of State Credit Union Regulators. My comments focus solely on the credit union regulatory structure and four distinct principles vital to the future growth and safety and soundness of State chartered credit unions. NASCUS believes regulatory reform must preserve charter choice and dual chartering, preserve the States' role in financial regulation, modernize the capital system for credit unions, and maintain strong consumer protections. First, preserving charter choice is crucial to any regulatory reform proposal. Charter choice is maintained by an active system of federalism that allows for clear communications and coordination between State and Federal regulators. Congress must continue to recognize and affirm the distinct roles played by State and Federal regulatory agencies. The Nation's regulatory structure must enable State credit union regulators to retain their regulatory authority over State-chartered credit unions. Further, it is important that new polices do not squelch the innovation and enhanced regulatory structure provided by the dual chartering system. The second principle I will highlight is preserving the State's role in financial regulation. The dual chartering system is predicated on the rights of States to authorize varying powers for their credit unions. NASCUS supports State authority to empower credit unions to engage in activities under State-specific rules. States should continue to have the authority to create and to maintain appropriate credit union powers in any new regulatory reform structure. Preemption of State laws and the push for more uniform regulatory systems will negatively impact our Nation's financial services industry and ultimately consumers. The third principle is the need to modernize the capital system of credit unions. We encourage Congress to include capital reform as part of the regulatory modernization process. State credit union regulators are committed to protecting credit union safety and soundness. Allowing credit unions to access supplemental capital would protect the credit union system and provide a tool for regulators if a credit union faces declining network or liquidity needs. Further, it will provide an additional layer of protection to the National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund, the NCUSIF, thereby maintaining credit unions' independence from the Federal Government and taxpayers. A simple fix to the definition of ``net worth'' in the Federal Credit Union Act would authorize regulators the discretion, when appropriate, to allow credit unions to use supplemental capital. The final principle I will discuss is the valuable role States play in consumer protection. Many consumer protection programs were designed by State legislators and State regulators to protect citizens in their States. The success of State programs have been recognized at the Federal level when like programs have been introduced. It is crucial that State legislatures have the primary role to enact consumer protection statutes for their residents and to promulgate and enforce State regulations. I would also mention that both State and Federal credit unions have access to the NCUSIF. federally insured credit unions capitalize this fund by depositing 1 percent of their shares into the fund. This concept is unique to credit unions and it minimizes exposure to the taxpayers. Any modernized regulatory system should recognize the NCUSIF. NASCUS and others are concerned about any proposal to consolidate regulators and eliminate State and Federal credit union charters. As Congress examines a regulatory reform system for credit unions, the following should be considered. Enhancing consumer choice provides a stronger financial regulatory system. Therefore, charter choice and dual chartering must be preserved. Preservation of the State's role in financial regulation is vital. Modernization of the capital system for credit unions is critical for safety and soundness. And strong consumer protection should be maintained, and these should be protected against Federal preemption. NASCUS appreciates the opportunity to testify and share our priorities. We urge the Committee to be watchful of Federal preemption and to remember the importance of dual chartering and charter choice in regulatory modernization. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF GEORGE REYNOLDS, CHAIRMAN, NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STATE CREDIT UNION SUPERVISORS, AND SENIOR DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, GEORGIA DEPARTMENT OF BANKING AND FINANCE 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Reynolds, and again, my appreciation to all of you here this morning. We are going to have an ongoing conversation with you as I know all of my colleagues are interested--deeply interested--in the subject matter of modernization of financial regulation. We are going to want to have as many conversations as we can with you as we move forward on how to develop these ideas. We all understand the critical importance of this and all of you can play a very critical role in helping us. Let me begin, if I can, with the issue of regulatory arbitrage, because all of you in your testimony addressed this issue as forum shopping. In 1994, when this Committee considered legislation to comprehensively reform of the financial regulatory system, then-Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen appeared before the Committee, and let me quote him for you on that day, some 15 years ago. He said, ``What we are seeing is a situation that enables banks to shop for the most lenient Federal regulator.'' In those very same hearings on that very same proposal, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, at the time Alan Greenspan, said the following, and I am quoting him, ``Every bank should have a choice of Federal regulator.'' So let me ask the panel here very quickly, beginning with you, Mr. Dugan, with whom do you agree? Should financial institutions be allowed to choose their regulators, leading to a potential race to the bottom, or should we attempt to end the regulatory arbitrage that is going on?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Well, I guess what I would say is this. Institutions should not be able to, when they have a problem with that one regulator, to leave that regulator to go to another regulator where they think they are not going to have the problem. I will say from the point of view of the OCC, we don't have any ability to stop someone from leaving, but we have ample authority to stop them from coming in and we exercise it. And so we will not allow someone to transfer in and become a national bank unless they have resolved their problems with their own institution and we make that clear, and we have had during my tenure as Comptroller several instances of companies wanting to come in and deciding not to when they realize that that would be the case. It is not a good situation to have people try to leave one problem to go to another. I am not sure you have to have only one charter to solve that problem. I think there are other ways to solve it where it does occur and I think there can be some benefits that some charters offer over others that are not what I just spoke about, and in those cases, I think that is a good thing. But it has to be clear. To go to the competition at the bottom, I think is a bad thing.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes. Chairman Bair.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Yes. I think the problems with regulatory arbitrage have been more severe regarding banks than nonbanks, especially on capital constraints--leverage constraints-- certainly with regard to investment banks versus commercial banks, and bank mortgage lenders versus nonbank mortgage lenders with regard to lending standards. So I think there needs to be some baseline standards that apply to all types of financial institutions, especially with consumer protection and basic prudential requirements, such as capital standards. I think there are still some problems within the category of banks. We have four different primary regulators now and I think there have been some issues. There have been issues we have seen with banks converting charters because they fear perhaps the regulatory approach by one regulator. We have seen banks convert charters in order to get preemption, which is not always a good thing. So I think there is more work to be done here. Part of that may be Congress's call in terms of whether they want to establish basic consumer protections that cannot be preempted-- whether you want Federal protection to be a floor or a ceiling for consumer protection. I think among us as regulators, we could do more to formalize agreements among ourselves that we will respect each other's CAMELS ratings and enforcement actions even if a charter is converted to remove the bad incentives for charter conversion. So I think there are some steps to be taken, but I do agree with what Joe said, we need both State and Federal charters. There is a long history of the dual banking system in the United States and I think that should be preserved.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You mentioned the four bank regulators, and I think Mr. Dugan made the point earlier that this could be a briefer hearing----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","----given the fact that we have the four regulators involved in all of this. Is this making any sense at all? And I am not jumping to one, but maybe the question ought to be what do we need out there to provide the safety and soundness and consumer protection. And I am not interested in just moving boxes around--take four and make it one--as attractive as that may seem to people, because that may defeat the very purpose of why we gather and talk about this issue. But the question is a basic one. Do we have too many regulators here and has that contributed, in your view, Sheila, to some of the issues we are confronting?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","I think that you probably could have fewer bank regulators. I do think you need at least a national and a State charter. I think you should preserve the dual structure. But I also think in terms of the immediate crisis, the bigger problems are with the bank versus nonbank arbitrage, not arbitrage within the banking system.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, Mr. Fryzel.",Speech, 
"Mr. Fryzel","Thank you, Senator. I agree with my colleagues that there should be the dual chartering system between State and Federal banks as well as credit unions. Chairman Bair says that there probably are too many bank regulators. Well, fortunately, we only have one credit union regulator, so I think that is something we should maintain. But again, I think we need to look at where are the problems? Which regulator perhaps hasn't done the job that they should have done, and maybe that is where the correction should be. I think the majority of regulators have done the best they possibly can considering what the circumstances are. I think they have taken the right types of moves to correct the situation that is out there with the economy the way it is. But for restructuring, I think we need to see where is the problem. Is it with the banks? Is it with the insurance companies? Is it with other types of financial institutions, and address that. And then making that improvement, determine whether or not we need the systemic risk regulator above these other institutions.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Governor.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I agree with my colleagues that we should not undermine the dual banking system in the United States, and so you are going to have at least two kinds of charters. It does seem to me, though, that the question is not so much one of can an institution choose, but what constraints are placed upon that choice. So, for example, under current law, with the improvements that were made to the Federal Deposit Insurance Act following the savings and loan crisis, there are now requirements on every federally insured institution that apply whether you are a State or a Federal bank. I think that Chairman Bair was alluding to some areas in which she might like to see more constraints within the capacity to choose, so that a bank cannot escape certain kinds of rules and regulations by moving from one charter to another.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, to make a distinction here, I do not know that anyone is really going to argue about the idea of having State-chartered and nationally chartered institutions, but are you suggesting having separate regulators, or could we talk about a common regulator and dual charters?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I think you have choices. Basically, of the four regulators of banks, you have two for Federal charters, two for State charters, and the question is: Does that make sense? You could have a single one for Federals; you could have a single one for States; you could have a single that cuts across all of them and still have two charters. There are complexities and issues with respect to each of those, and I should not leave out you have 12 Federal Reserve banks.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","No. I know.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Which is another set of people at the table.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","My own view, I think there are too many. I agree with Chairman Bair. I do not think that was a substantial cause of the problems that we have seen, but if you are looking at creating more efficiency and providing a system that is more flexible and works better, I think you do not need--we do not have four FDAs.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Would you agree with that, Sheila, that you can have a common regulator and dual charters?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think it is tricky with the State charter we should not leave out the 50 State regulators. The Fed and the FDIC partner with the State regulators in our examination activities. So I think you could certainly consolidate all the Federal oversight with one Federal regulator. We would still, I assume, if you preserve a State charter, have shared responsibilities with the State regulator. And so there has been historical competition between national and State charters that----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Doesn't that lend itself to shopping again here? The point that Mr. Dugan raised here, that the FDA does not have a national regulator and a State regulator when it comes to food and drug safety. Why not financial products? Why shouldn't they be as safe?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","I think for the smaller banks, for the community banks, they like having the state option.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Yes.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","They like having the State option. They like having the regulator that is a little closer, more local to them, more accessible to them. So I think there are some benefits and I strongly support continuation of the community banking sector here, and I think maintaining the State charter is essential to that.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me jump----",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Mr. Chairman, if I could offer--in our written testimony--and I tried to synopsize it in my oral--we believe the dual banking system, State and Federal, makes sense. But we believe that the business model and the strategy of the organization should then dictate what regulatory agency oversees it. So from our perspective, there is a clear distinction between a commercial bank and a community and consumer bank. And it does not make a difference whether it is a Federal charter or State charter. Under our approach, we would submit to you that you have a Federal regulator and a Federal charter for commercial banks. And you have the same for community and consumer banks. And then if it is a State-chartered entity that fits one of those two business strategies, the relevant Federal regulator works with it. So it retains the dual banking system. It prevents the ability of the individual institution to select a regulator. Instead, this schematic would suggest that the business strategy determines the regulator.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","That is a good point. Let me finish up, and I apologize to my colleagues. I will just get the comments and then go quickly to the----",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","I would say that as a State charterer who has good experience with both of our Federal colleagues, we need to say that the current State system involves what we have called constructive or cooperative federalism now, and State-chartered banks are not exempt or are not free from federally enforced standards.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","And to be frank, we are grateful we have been included in the FFIC because in that case we work with our Federal colleagues to establish standards that we understand have to apply across the board. As I say in my testimony, we understand we have got to raise our game. In other words, we understand that going forward, working with our Federal colleagues, we would like to have a place in setting national standards and in enforcing them. But I think actually even in light of the current problems we have, the system has, the State system, in partnership with the Fed and the FDIC, is holding up so far. We have got our issues, but we are holding up pretty well. So I think there is a question in the future about our continuing to work more cooperatively with our Federal partners, and I think that can help.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Reynolds.",Speech, 
"Mr. Reynolds","Well, my observation, as a regulator that has been involved in financial institution regulation for over 30 years, is that we do not have any tolerance for forum shopping; we do not have any tolerance for trying to arbitrage safety and soundness. And it has been my experience in dealing with other State regulators that that same approach applies. I think the State system does provide choice, but I do not believe there is any tolerance for that type of behavior in a State system.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thanks very much.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank all of you for your testimony and your service. Ms. Bair, Chairman Bair, let me ask you this: Do you think that not having an entity that can do the overall resolution for complex entities is affecting the policies that we have in place right now as it relates to supporting them?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","It absolutely is. There is really no practical alternative to the course that has been set right now, because there is no flexibility for resolution.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","So much of the actions that we are taking as a Congress and as an administration to support some of these entities have to do with the fact that we really do not have any way to unwind them in a logical way. Is that correct?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","I do agree with that.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I know the Chairman mentioned the potential of FDIC being the systemic regulator. What would be the things that the FDIC would need to do to move beyond bank resolution but into other complex entities like AIG, Lehman Brothers, and others?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Right. Well, we think that if we had resolution authority, we actually should be separate from where we have the requirements for prudential supervision of systemic institutions. Those responsibilities are actually separated now, and I think it is a good check and balance to have the resolution authority with some back-up supervisory authority working in conjunction with the primary regulator who has responsibility for prudential supervision. In terms of resolution authority, I think that the current system--that we would like--if we were given it, is a good one. We can set up bridge banks, or conservatorships to provide for the orderly unwinding of institutions. There is a clear set of priorities, so investors and creditors know in advance what the imposition of loss will be. We do have the flexibility to deviate from that, but it is an extraordinary process that includes a super majority of the FDIC Board, the Federal Reserve Board, the concurrence of the Secretary of the Treasury and the President. So it is a very extraordinary procedure to deviate from the baseline requirement to minimize cost. So I think the model we have now is a good one and could be applied more broadly to complex financial organizations.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","It sounds like in your opinion in a fairly easy way.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think one easy step would be just to give us authority to resolve bank and thrift holding companies. I think that would be--I think there are going to be larger, more complex issues in terms of going beyond that category, what is systemic when you talk about insurance companies, hedge funds, other types of financial institutions. But, yes, I think that would be a relatively simple step that would give us all some additional flexibility, yes.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Thank you Mr. Dugan, you know, we talk about capital requirements and institutions, but regardless of the capital that any particular institution has, if they make really bad loans or make really bad decisions, it really does not matter how much they have, as we have seen, right? Are we focusing enough on minimum lending standards as we think about the overall regulation of financial institutions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I think that is a very good question. I think capital is not enough by itself. I think you are right. And as I mentioned in my testimony, in the area of mortgages, I think if we had had or if we would have in the future some sort of more national standard in the area of--and if I think of two areas going back that I wish we had over again 10 years ago, it is in the area of stated income or no-documentation loans, and it is in the area of loan-to-value ratios or the requirement for a significant downpayment. Those are underwriting standards. They are our loan standards, and I think if we had more of a national minimum, as, for example, they have had in Canada and as we had in the GSE statutes for GSE conforming loans, I think we would have had far fewer problems. Now, fewer people would have gotten mortgages, and there would have been fewer people that would have been able to purchase homes, and there would be pressure on affordability. But it would have been a more prudent, sound, underwriting standard that would have protected us from a lot of problems.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","I hope as we move forward with this you will continue to talk about that, because I think that is a very important component that may be left by the wayside. And I hope that all of us will look at a cause-neutral solution going forward. Right now we are focused on home mortgages and credit default swaps. But we do not know what the next cause might be. Mr. Tarullo, you mentioned something about credit default swaps, and I am not advocating this, but I am just asking the question. In light of the fact that it looks like as you go down the chain, I mean, we end up having far more credit default swap mechanisms in place than we have actual loans or collateral that is being insured, right? I mean, it is multiplied over and over and over. And it looks like that the person that is at the very end of the chain is kind of the greater fool, OK, because everybody keeps laying off. Is there any thought about the fact that credit default swaps may be OK, but the only people who should enter into those arrangements ought to be people that actually have an interest in the actual collateral itself and that you do not, in essence, put in place this off-racetrack-betting mechanism that has nothing whatsoever to do with the collateral that is being insured itself? Have there been any thoughts about that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think that issue has been investigated and discussed by a number of people, in and out of the Government. Here, I think, are the issues. There is a group of market actors who have a reason why they want to hedge a particular exposure or instrument, and the most efficient way for them to do that is to have a credit default swap associated with a particular institution or product, even when they do not own the underlying product because there is a relationship. The difficulty, as a lot of people have pointed out, would come in trying to craft a rule which would allow that to occur while ending the kind of practice that I think you are worried about, which is much less tethered to a hedging strategy. I do think when it comes to credit default swaps, we can make a couple of observations, though. One, they do underscore, again, the importance of monitoring and overseeing the arenas in which big market actors come together. Making sure that there is a central counterparty, for example, helps to contain some of the risks associated with the use of credit default swaps. And, second, the problems with credit default swaps that we associate with this crisis did not come from institutions that were being regulated by Mr. Dugan, for example, or bank holding companies being regulated by the Fed. What does that tell you? It tells us that although looking at the interaction of entities is important, you still should do good, solid supervision of particular institutions. And if they have capital requirements and liquidity requirements and good risk management practices, then whatever use a particular trade an entity is putting a credit default swap to, we will not allow them to acquire too much exposure.",Speech, 
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, my time is up. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Warner. And let me just say what I am going to do, this vote has started. I am going to go over and make the vote and come right back. So if you finish up, Senator Merkley, you may have time for questions as well, and I will try and get right back with other members as well.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Well, Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing and for your leadership in the reform efforts that are going forward. I know the subject today is how do we reform on a prospective basis, but in the interim, as we have seen with the public and congressional outrage over AIG and with certain other actions by a number of our institutions, until we get this new regulatory structure in place, what I think we keep hearing is, well, we do not really have any tools to stop these actions. One area that I have had some folks talk to me about--and I would like to get your opinion--is that under the Federal Deposit Insurance Act--which obviously all of the Federal regulators have the ability to enforce, not only the FDIC but the OCC, OTS, and the Fed--my understanding is regulators do have at least the statutory ability to issue cease and desist orders to institutions or individuals if somebody has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices, if somebody has engaged in a breach of their fiduciary duty, or if somebody has received financial gain or other benefits that show willful disregard for the safety and soundness of the institution. And I understand that, you know, the case law is fairly narrow here, but my understanding of the remedies you have got is you can ban somebody from banking, you can get restitution, you can impose a series of other penalties. But, boy, oh, boy, with narrow case law, it sure does seem that some of the actions that have taken place--and, again, case in point being AIG, and I know the fact that it was offshore, off balance sheet, in the London derivatives entity, but it sure seems like this tool could be used or could be pushed because there sure has been a whole lot of activities that have led to either financial enrichment or unsound practices, at least in retrospect now. And I just question, you know, have you thought through this tool. Have you investigated it? Have you not used it because you felt that there would be--the case law would not allow it? And why not take a little bit of risk in pushing the edge, particularly with the amount of abuse and the amount of public outrage that we see today? Mr. Polakoff, do you want to start? And I would love to hear from all of the regulators.",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, if I could offer some thoughts regarding AIG, as you know, September 15, 2008, with the Government's action, caused AIG to no longer be a savings and loan holding company. So 6 months have passed since that time. I can assure that if AIG was still a savings and loan holding company, we would have taken enforcement action under safety and soundness to say those bonuses were an unsafe and unsound practice and would not have allowed it. But it is not a savings and loan holding company.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","I know the Government owns it, but even though the fact that there is a Treasury-owned trust, you say that--I know you testified here a week ago that, yes, you had oversight over AIG and maybe you have missed a bit. And now you are saying you have no regulatory ability to take any of these actions?",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Once the Government took ownership, by statute it is no longer a savings and loan holding company.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But the Government--again, I know you would know the law better than I, but I thought the Government has not taken full ownership, that there is still a trust in which the Treasury and others help put members. But you are saying-- even though the trust is an independent trust, it is not owned entirely and controlled entirely by the Government. As an independent trust, wouldn't you still have regulatory----",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","No. Our legal analysis says that the control is with the Government. I mean, we would be thrilled if we could get to the legal status that it is still a savings and loan holding company. It would allow us to take action.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Let me hear from the regulators on the panel whether beyond just the AIG specific example, whether this tool--whether you have thought through using this tool as we have seen other actions, AIG being the most egregious, but there are other institutions that I think fall into that category. Ms. Bair?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I would say the FDI Act applies to depository institutions, and obviously AIG had a small thrift, a depository institution regulated by OTS, and OTS was their holding company regulator.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Right.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","But our authority as back-up supervisor and primary Federal regulator of nonmember State-chartered banks is only to the depository institution. When we take a bank over as receiver or conservator, we have separate authorities to repudiate all employment contracts. Typically, the boards are gone, obviously. The senior management is generally let go. And those who were responsible for the bank's problems are typically let go as well. We very aggressively pick and choose who we want to keep and who we think needs to leave when an institution fails and we become receiver or conservator. So we do use it in that context. Again, that is just for a bank, the depository institution part, and AIG certainly was a much larger entity.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","But since the Fed and the OCC also, I believe, enforce this act, have you thought through using this tool for actions that you may find to be unsafe or where individuals might have received financial benefit with willful disregard to the safety and soundness of the underlying institution?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I think, Senator, your question raises two questions: one about where we are now, but an important one about going forward as well. As to where we are now in respect to the compensation issues, by and large, as you know, those have been for TARP recipient institutions; those have been things that are either congressionally mandated or put in place by the Treasury Department. And so far as I am aware, with respect to institutions over which the Fed has regulatory authority, there has not been thought of going beyond the congressional and Treasury policies on compensation. I think, though, that the larger question you raise is one, again, of regulatory gaps. As Chairman Bair said, in order to be able to exercise any authority, you have got to have the basic supervisory structure in place. And so, thinking about where problems which anticipate today are going to arise underscores the importance of making sure that each of these systemically important institutions is, in fact, subject to the kinds of rules that you are talking about.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Mr. Dugan, I know our time has about expired, but I just----",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Yes, well, we have a range of tools, of course, both informal and formal, for a number of different things. But in the compensation area, to find willful disregard that causes a safety and soundness problem is, in fact, a quite high standard to meet. There is separate authority under Part 30 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act that the so-called safety and soundness standards that were adopted in FDICIA, also a somewhat lower standard but still tied to the safety and soundness of the institution, that possibly you could make a connection to. And we do look at these, but as I said, to make that connection to the safety and soundness is not an easy thing to do.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","My only sense--and I would love to pursue this a bit more--is that we all understand we have got to fix this problem on a prospective basis. But there is still an interim time between now and when Congress would act and these new rules and regulations would be in place. I would just urge you to perhaps revisit with your legal staffs this tool because, as we have seen, it is not healthy for the public's confidence in the overall financial system when we see the kind of excesses and everybody saying we do not have any tools to go after this, when it appears there may be at least partial tools still here.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","And I just wanted to re-emphasize what I had indicated earlier about our lack of resolution authority that applies to the entire organization.",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Absolutely. Very valid----",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","The FDIC has very broad authority to repudiate these contracts at the discretion of the receiver/conservator. I think AIG is a good example. If the bank regulators had resolution authority of the entire organization, probably this problem would not----",Speech, 
"Senator Warner","Very, very valid point. But, again, we still have some interim period that may be a long period of months, and if the public has lost all confidence in the fairness and soundness of the actions of some actors in the financial community, it is going to make our challenge and task in terms of striking that appropriate balance between the free market system and appropriate regulatory oversight even more difficult going forward. So thank you very much. Senator Reed . Senator Merkley.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Very quick responses, because I understand it is 4 minutes until the closing of the vote. Chairman Bair, you noted the need to address the issue of ``too big to fail,'' and I believe talked in your testimony about increasing financial obligations as the size of organizations creates greater risk and perhaps regulating the public funds available to very large financial institutions. Do we need to also explore the issue of how mergers and acquisitions affect the growth of individual institutions? Is there any point in the process of a firm growing through mergers or acquisitions that this issue needs to be addressed? And I would open that up to any of you, and please speak quickly.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Right, and I will speak quickly and turn it over to Dan because the Fed reviews merger and acquisition activity. But, yes, I think that is part of it. I think compensation tied to successful mergers and acquisitions, executive compensation tied to growth for the sake of growth is another area that I think has fed into this current problem we have.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Did I catch you right that executive compensation as it is tied into growth?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","As it is tied into merger activity and growth, yes, I think that help feeds the beast. I do.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Certainly, Senator, with respect to mergers under the Bank Holding Company Act, there ought to be and is scrutiny under the anti-trust laws to determine whether there are going to be anti-competitive consequences to the merger. But you should understand that the competition analysis as it is put forth in the statute does not in itself directly feed into the issues of size and systemic risk. And so there does need to be an independent focus on systemic risk beyond the traditional anti-trust question of whether a merger would reduce competition in a particular market.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Does anyone else want to add to that?",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Senator, I would just say real quick that for thrifts or savings and loan holding companies where there is a merger, there is absolutely an assessment of what the consolidated risk profile looks like and the competency of management. And I think all the regulators go through that analysis with a merger.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","So you feel like this--in your case, you are saying it has really been addressed in the past, we have done a great job, and no need to change any particular approach to that issue?",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","When it comes to mergers, I think the regulators have the right powers to assess the consolidated risk profile of the company in deciding whether to approve it or not, yes, sir.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","They have those powers. Have they exercised those powers?",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Yes, sir.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Anyone else?",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","OK. I want to turn to the issue of consumer protection and how this feeds into the risk, kind of the retail issues. Certainly it is my view that the current crisis is an example of how failure to provide for adequate consumer protection compromises the safe and sound operation of financial institutions. What is your view of the role of consumer protection in supervision and regulation? And how effective do you think your particular agencies have been in addressing the consumer protection side? Whoever would like to jump into that.",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","I will jump in. I think, first of all, there is a keen connection between consumer protection and safety and soundness. That is one of the reasons that I believe all the regulatory agencies, as part of any safety and soundness examination, look at all of the consumer complaints. They keep a file. They look at them. They work through them, because there is a keen connection when consumers are complaining, they have some potential safety and soundness-related issues. I think all of us--certainly OTS has a robust system for addressing consumer complaints. We have made a number of referrals, actually a large number of referrals to Justice for fair lending issues. And I think it is a trend that many of the agencies are seeing.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I would say that consumer protection is related both to safety and soundness and, as I suggested in my prepared remarks, to systemic risk. With respect to how consumer protection is done recently, I have to say in the interest of full disclosure, as you know I have only been at the Fed for 6 weeks, and before that was an academic who was critical of the failure of our bank regulatory agencies to give as much attention to consumer protection as they ought to. I do think in the last couple of years there has been renewed attention to it and that things have moved in a better direction. But I think it is something that everybody is going to need to continue to pay attention to.",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","Senator, if I could respond to that briefly?",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","Please, Mr. Smith.",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","On behalf of the States, I will say that with regard to the mortgage issue, for example, the State response to the mortgage issue may have been imperfect, and it may not have been complete. In North Carolina, we started addressing predatory lending in 1999. I would say that I think that the actions of State AGs and State regulators should have been and ought to be in the future, market information in assessing systemic risk ought to be taken into account. And I think this has not been done in the past. Again, I do not claim that we are perfect. I do claim that we are closer to the market as a rule than our colleagues in the Federal Government. And I think we have something to add if we are allowed to add it. So I hope as we go forward, sir, the State role in consumer protection will be acknowledged and it will be given a chance to do more.",Speech, 
"Senator Merkley","OK. Well, let me just close with this comment since my time is up. The comment that this issue has had robust attention--I believe, Mr. Polakoff, you made that-- WAMU was a thrift. Countrywide was a thrift. On the ground, it does not look like anything close to robust regulation of consumer issues. I will say I really want to applaud the Fed for the actions they took over subprime lending, their action regarding escrow for taxes and insurance, their addressing of abusive prepayment penalties, the ending of liar loans in subprime. But I also want to say that from the perspective of many folks on the ground, one of the key elements was booted down the road, and that was the yield spread premiums. Just to capture this, when Americans go to a real estate agent, they have all kinds of protection about conflict of interest. But when they go to a broker, it is a lamb to the slaughter. That broker is being paid, unbeknownst to the customer is being paid proportionally to how bad a loan that consumer gets. And that conflict of interest, that failure to address it, the fact that essentially kickbacks are involved, results in a large number of our citizens, on the most important financial transaction of their life, ending up with a subprime loan rather than a prime loan. That is an outrage. And I really want to encourage you, sir, in your new capacity to carry this conversation. The Fed has powers that it has not fully utilized. I do applaud the steps it has taken. And I just want to leave with this comment: that the foundation of so many families financially is their homes, and that we need to provide superb protections designed to strengthen our families, not deregulation or loose regulations designed for short-term profits. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Senator Johanns.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Thank you very much. I am not even exactly certain who I direct this to, so I am hoping that you all have just enough courage to jump in and offer some thoughts about what I want to talk about today. As I was sitting here and listening to the great questioning from my colleague, the response to one of the questions was that we do make a risk assessment when there is a merger. We make an assessment as to the risk that is being taken on by this merger. And I sit here, I have to tell you, and I think to myself, well, if it is working that well, how did we end up where we are at today? So that leads me to these questions. The first one is, who has the authority, or does the authority exist for somebody to say that the sheer size of what we end up with poses a risk to our overall national, if not international economy, because you have got so many eggs in one basket that if your judgment is wrong about the risk assessment, you are not only wrong a little bit, you are wrong in a very magnificent sort of way. So who has that authority? Does that authority exist, and if it doesn't, should it exist?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, subject to correction or qualification by my colleagues, I can say that at present, there is no existing authority to take that kind of top-down look at the entire system and to make a judgment as to whether there is systemic risk arising--again, not out of individual actions, but out of what is happening collectively. Now, there is one point I should have made in my introductory remarks, and I will take your question as an opportunity to make it. We all need to be--I hope you are, and we certainly will be--we all need to be realistic about what we can achieve collectively, that is, everybody sitting here on the panel and all of you, in addressing this systemic risk issue. Because I don't think anybody should be under the illusion that simply by saying, oh, yes, systemic risk is important and everybody ought to pay more attention to it, that we are going to solve a lot of the really difficult analytic problems. Now, we all remember what happened 4 or 5 years ago when some people, with great prescience, raised issues about whether risks were being created by what was going on in the subprime market. And at the same time, many other people came back and said, don't kill this market. So what in retrospect appears to everybody to be a clear case of over-leveraging and bad underwriting and a bubble and all the rest, in at least some cases in real time produces a big debate over whether you are killing the market or you are regulating in the interest of the system. So that is not, I know, directly responsive to your question, but I do hope that everybody understands that this is going to be a challenge for us all going forward, to make sure that constraints are being placed where they ought to be, but to recognize that nobody wants to kill the process of credit allocation in the United States.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Could we agree, and I appreciate you offering that. I appreciate the candor of your testimony. Could we agree, members of the panel, that if we really wanted today to make an assessment, again, getting back to this, it just gets so big and there are so few left that we are putting the whole economy at risk if one of them fails, that there really isn't anybody who can step in and say, time out. We can't do that merger or whatever based upon that premise. Or is that a false assumption on my part? Yes, sir?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I would just make two points. One is, we do have on the banking side a Congressional limit on the amount, the share of deposits that you can have in the United States----",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","and that is an effective limit of a kind on growth. It doesn't prevent very large institutions, but it prevents--we still have, by worldwide standards, a quite deep consolidated U.S., or lack of concentrated U.S. industry. And, of course, you have the anti-trust limits. But there is nothing in the law that I am aware of that says just because you get large, other than what I just spoke about, that there is a limit on it. And I would also say that there are large American companies that need large banks, and so you have to be careful if you put some other kind of limit on it that you wouldn't have large European or Asian institutions come and make large loans. So we have to----",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Take the business away.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","----keep a balance here. There is a balance.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Yes. The second thought I want to throw out, and I am very close to being out of time here, and these are very complicated issues, but I would like a quick thought if the Chairman will indulge me. Chairman Dodd . Certainly.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","Let us say that you do have an institution. You have made your risk assessment. A merger has occurred. And all of a sudden you are looking at it and saying, boy, there were some things here that, if I had to do it over again, I would do it differently. Maybe they have gone a step, two, or three or four further than you anticipated they were going to, and now you can see the risk is growing and growing and growing to a dangerous level. Do we have in our system the cord we can pull that is the safety valve that says, again, in effect, time out. We are at a level where the risk is not acceptable for our economy.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think with respect to a regulated institution, which I believe is the premise of your question, the answer is yes. If the institution is regulated, then somebody sitting at this table is going to have the authority to say, you are assuming too many risks and you need to reduce your exposures in a particular area, you need to increase your capital, you need to do better liquidity management, whatever the proper guidance might be. The one footnote I place there again is that in order to get to that point, we need to make sure that people are aware of the risks, and sometimes just looking at it from the standpoint of the institution is completely adequate. It is always necessary. But there are these circumstances, and I think we have seen some of them in the last couple of years, where you do need to have a bit more of a system-wide perspective in order to know that something is a risk.",Speech, 
"Senator Johanns","I will just wrap up with this thought, because I am out of time, and I will try to do so quickly. I think it is a real frustration for us here to be faced with these issues of, well, Mike, this is just way too big to allow it to fail, and, Mike, it is going to take taxpayers' money to unravel the risk that they have gotten themselves into and a lot of money. These are big institutions. It is going to take big money. And so you can see from my questions what I am trying to do is if we are going to think about this in a global way--I certainly don't want to stall growth in this Nation. I mean, gosh, we are the greatest Nation on earth. But on the other hand, I would like to think whatever we are doing, we are going to give some policymakers the ability and some regulators the ability to, in effect, say, time out.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Mr. Chairman, could I answer briefly?",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Certainly.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I not only understand but sympathize with your perspective, and with respect to your closing remarks, here is what I would suggest back to you: A number of the instruments--I would say, if I can over-generalize, a lot of what is in the prepared, the long prepared testimony of people at this table today is a rehearsing of some of the instruments which are available to you. And I am sure you and your staff and your colleagues, after you go through them all, you are going to want to tweak some. You may not be in favor of others at all. But I think this is the opportunity that we all have, which is to take this moment, not only to do an internal self-examination, but also to say, OK, how are we going to revamp this system to put in place structures that avoid exactly the kind of situation you are talking about? So just to use two, because I don't want to take up too much time, the resolution mechanism about which you have heard so much from Mr. Dugan, Ms. Bair, and me is really very important here precisely because of its association with a ``too big to fail'' institution. Making sure that systemically important institutions are regulated in a way that takes that systemic importance into account in the first instance, with the capital and liquidity requirements they have, will be steps along that road.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and I totally agree with that. I think that is very, very important.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank the witnesses. I have great respect for your efforts and your colleagues' efforts to enforce the laws and to provide the kind of stability and regulation necessary for a thriving financial system. I think I have seen Mr. Polakoff at least three times this week, so I know you put in a lot of hours in here as well as back in the office, so thank you for that. Yesterday, we had a hearing based on a GAO report about the risk assessment capacities and capabilities of financial institutions, but one of the things that struck me is that perhaps either inadvertently or advertently, we have given you conflicting tasks. One is to maintain confidence in the financial system of the United States, but at the same time giving you the responsibility to expose those faults in the financial system to the public, to the markets, and also to Congress. And I think in reflecting back over the last several years or months, what has seemed to trump a lot of decisions by all these agencies has been the need or the perceived need to maintain confidence in the system when, in fact, many regulators had grave doubts about the ability of the system to perform, the risks that were being assembled, the strategies that were being pursued. And I think if we don't at least confront that conflict or conundrum directly, we could reassign responsibilities without making a significant change in anything we do. And so in that respect, I wonder if you have any kind of thoughts about this tradeoff between your role as cheerleaders for the banking system and your role as referees for the banking system. Mr. Dugan?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Well, I am not sure I would describe it as the cheerleader----",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","I think in some cases, we heard the cheers echoing through the halls.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I guess what I would say, Senator, is there is a tension with financial institutions that depend so heavily on confidence, particularly because of the run risk that was described earlier. And I am not just talking about depositors getting in line. I am talking about funding. That has always informed and is very deeply embedded in our whole system of financial regulation. There is much about what we do and how we do it that is by design confidential supervisory information and we do have to be careful in everything we do and how we talk about it, about not creating or making a situation worse. And at the same time, the tension you quite rightly talk about is knowing that there are problems that need to be addressed and finding ways to address them in public forums without running afoul of that earlier problem, and it gets harder when we have bigger problems in a financial crisis like the one we have and we all have to work hard to get through that and to try to work with that tension, and I think we can do that by the kinds of hearings that you have had. I think we have to avoid commenting about specific open institutions, but there are many things we can talk about and get at and I think that is what we need to do.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Ms. Bair, and I will try to get around briefly because of the time limit. Ms. Bair?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I hope we are cheerleaders for depositors. I think we are all about stability and public confidence, so I think it is important to keep perspective, though, for all bank regulators, that what we do should always be tied to the broader public interest. It is not our job to protect banks. It is our job to protect the economy and the system, and to the extent our regulatory functions relate to that, that is how they should be focused. I do think that the market is confused now because different situations have been handled in different ways, and I hate to sound like a Johnny-one-note, but I think a lot of it does come back to this inability to have a legal structure for resolving institutions once they get into trouble. I think whatever that structure might eventually look like, just clarity for the market--for investors and creditors--about how they will be treated and the consistency of the treatment, would go a long way to promoting financial stability and confidence.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Fryzel.",Speech, 
"Mr. Fryzel","Thank you, Senator. Paramount to NCUA is the safety and soundness of the funds of all our 90 million members in credit unions across this country, and in an effort to maintain their confidence is not an easy task, and we have made every effort to do so by public awareness campaigns. Certainly the action by Congress in raising the $250,000 limit has been fantastic in regards to the safety and their ability to think that their funds, or to know that their funds are safe. We tried to draw the fine line in letting them know that, yes, there are problems in our financial structure, but we are dealing with them and we are going to use the tools that we have to make sure that things get better. And when this economy turns around, financial institutions are again going to be in the position where they are going to be able to serve these consumers in the way they have in the past. So yes, Senator, it is a fine line, but I think it is one that we have to keep talking about. We cannot let anyone think that there are not problems out there. We have to tell them we are in a great country. This economy does come back and everything is going to be better in the future.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Tarullo.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I may have misunderstood. I understood you to be asking not about regulatory actions in the midst of the crisis, but in the period preceding it, when supervision is supposed to be ongoing. And I think there is a lot to the question that you asked, not so much because, I would say, of the conflict of interests as such between different roles, but because everybody tends to fall into a notion of what operating principles are for whatever period we may be in. And so people come to accept things. Bankers do, supervisors do, maybe even Members of Congress do--something that is ongoing, is precisely because it has been ongoing, thought to be an acceptable situation. So I think from both our perspective and your perspective the challenge here is to figure out what kinds of mechanisms we put in place within agencies, between the Hill and agencies in legislation which force consideration of the kinds of emerging issues that we can't predict now because we don't know what the next crisis might look like, but which are going to be noticed by somebody along the way. And while I really don't want to overstate the potential utility of a systemic risk regulator for the reasons I said earlier, I would say that in an environment in which an overall assessment of the system is an explicit part of the mandate of one or more entities in the U.S. Government, you at least increase the chances that that kind of disparate information gets pulled together and somebody has to focus on it. Now, what you do with it, that is another set of questions, but I think that gets you at least a little bit down the road.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Polakoff, and my time is expiring, so your brevity is appreciated.",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","I will be as short as possible, Senator. Thank you. We are not in the current situation we are in today because of actions over the last six to 12 months by the regulators, or in a lot of cases the bankers. It is from 3, 4, 5 years ago. I think the notion of counter-cyclical regulation needs to be discussed at some point. When the economy is strong is when we should be our strongest in being aggressive, and when the economy is struggling, I think is when we need to be sure that we are not being too strong. Any of us at this table can prevent a bank from failing. We can prevent banks from failing. But what will happen is people who deserve credit will not get credit because they will be on the bubble. The thing I love about bank supervision is it is part art and it is part science, and I think what we are doing today is going to address the situation today. We have got to be careful we are doing the right thing for tomorrow and next year, as well.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Smith, and then Mr. Reynolds.",Speech, 
"Mr. Smith","Thank you, Senator. I agree with my friend, the Comptroller, that the two concepts of supervisory authority, on the one hand, and consumer protection, on the other, are intertwined. They should not be drawn apart. I will say that in the State system, sir, we have the advantage of having a partner with friends in the Federal Government. We have cooperative federalism. That is a good thing, because our Federal friends help us and sometimes tell us things we don't want to know, particularly about consumer compliance, that makes our system of regulation stronger. I would suggest, sir, that some of the actions the States have taken in consumer protection in the past, if they had been listened to, would have helped in terms of determining the systemic--understanding what the systemic risk of some activities in the marketplace were, and so I believe that as a part, as we say in our testimony, as part of an ongoing system of supervision, I would argue, and I will agree with, I believe, with Governor Tarullo, that you need--the fact that you have multiple regulators focusing on an issue can, in the proper circumstance, if there is cooperation, result in better regulation. The idea of a single regulator, I think, is inherently flawed.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Mr. Reynolds.",Speech, 
"Mr. Reynolds","My comment would be that it is appropriate that we take a measured response. I agree with Mr. Polakoff's observation that regulators have the ability to tighten down on regulation to the point where we make credit availability an issue. On the other side, it is important that our role as safety and soundness regulators be the primary role that we play and that we are not in the business of being cheerleaders for the industry. I am certain that my bankers and my credit union managers in the State of Georgia don't regard me as a cheerleader.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","My time has expired. Thank you.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you, Senator, very much. I should have taken note, and I apologize for not doing so, Senator Reed had a very good subcommittee hearing yesterday, and this is the seventh hearing we have had just this year on the subject matter of modernization of Federal regulations. We had dozens last year going back and examining the crisis as well as beginning to explore ideas on how to go forward. And so I am very grateful to Jack and the other subcommittee chairs who are meeting, as well. We have four hearings this week alone just on the subject matter, so it is very, very helpful and I thank Senator Reed for that.",Speech, 
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I am going to turn to Senator Menendez, but I want to come back to this notion about a supervisory capacity and consumer protection, because too often, the safety and soundness dominates the consumer protection debate and we have got to figure out a new direction--that can't go on, in my view. There has got to be a better way of dealing with this. But let me turn to Senator Menendez.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Chairman, I have a statement for the record, so I hope that can be included.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","It will be included.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Mr. Chairman, I look forward to asking some questions specifically, but I want to turn first to",Speech, 
"Chairman Bair","I cannot pass up the opportunity, first to compliment you on a whole host of things you are doing on foreclosure mitigation and what not. I think you were ahead of the curve when others were not and really applaud you for that. But I do have a concern. I have heard from scores of community banks who are saying, you know, we understand the need to rebuild the Federal Deposit Insurance Fund, but I understand when they say to me, look, we are not the ones who drove this situation. We have to compete against entities that are receiving TARP funds. We are not. And in some cases, we are looking at anywhere between 50 and 100 percent of profit. Isn't there--I know that--I understand you are statutorily prohibited from discriminating large versus small, but in this once--and so I understand this is supposedly a one-time assessment. Wouldn't it be appropriate for us to give you the authority to vary this in a way that doesn't have a tremendous effect on the one entity, it seems to me, that is actually out there lending in the marketplace as best as they can?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, a couple of things. We have signaled strongly that if Congress will move with raising our borrowing authority, we feel that that will give us a little more breathing room.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","With what? I am sorry, I didn't hear.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","If Congress raises our borrowing authority-- Chairman Dodd and Senator Crapo have introduced a bill to do just that--if that can be done relatively soon, then we think we would have some flexibility to reduce the special assessment. Right now, we have built in a good cushion above what our loss projections would suggest would take us to zero because we think the borrowing authority does need to be raised. It has been at $30 billion since 1991. So we do think that needs to happen. But if it does get raised, we feel we could reduce our cushion a bit. Also, the FDIC Board just approved a phase-out of our TLGP, what we call our TLGP Debt Guarantee Program. We are raising the cost of that program through surcharges which we will put into the Deposit Insurance Fund. This could also reduce the need for the special assessment and so we will be monitoring that very closely. We have also asked for comment about whether we should change the assessment base for the special assessment. Right now, we use domestic deposits. If you used all bank assets, that would shift the burden to some of the larger institutions, because they rely less on deposits than the smaller institutions. So we are gathering comment on that right now. We will probably make a final decision in late May. Increasing the borrowing authority plus we expect to get some significant revenue through this surcharge we have just imposed on our TLGP--most of the larger banks are the beneficiaries of that Debt Guarantee program--we think that will help a lot.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, I look forward, Mr. Chairman, to working with you to try to make this happen, because these community banks are the ones that are actually out there still lending in communities at a time in which we generally don't see much credit available. But this is a huge blow to them and however we can--I will submit my own comments for the regulatory process, but however we can lighten the load, I think will be incredibly important. Mr. Dugan, I want to pursue a couple of things with you. You recently said in a letter to the Congressional Oversight Panel, essentially defending your agency. Included in that letter is a chart of the ten worst, the lenders with the higher subprime and Alternate A foreclosure rates. Now, I see that three of them on this list have been originating entities under your supervision--Wells Fargo, Countrywide, and First Franklin. Can you tell us what your supervision of these entities told you during 2005 to 2007 about their practices?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, as I said before, we certainly did have some institutions that were engaged in subprime lending, and what I said also is that it is a relatively smaller share of overall subprime lending in the home market and what you see. It was roughly ten to 15 percent of all subprime loans in 2005 and 2006, even though we have a much larger share of the mortgage market. I think you will find that of the providers of those loans, the foreclosure rates were lower and were somewhat better underwritten, even though there were problem loans, and I don't deny that at all, and I would say that, historically, the commercial banks, both State and national, were much more heavily intensively regulating and supervising loans, including subprime loans. We had had a very bad experience 10 years ago or so with subprime credit cards, and as a result, we were not viewed as a particularly hospitable place to conduct subprime lending business. So even with organizations that were complex bank holding companies, they tended to do their subprime lending in holding company affiliates rather than in the bank or in the subsidiary of the bank where we regulated them. We did have some, but it turned out it was a much smaller percentage of the overall system than the subprime loans that were actually done.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, subprimes is one thing. The Alternate As is another. Let me ask you this. How many examiners, on-site examiners, did you recently have at Bank of America, at Citi, at Wachovia, at Wells?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","It is different for each one of those, but we have--on-site examiners can vary in our largest banks from 50 to 70 examiners. It is a very substantial number, depending on which organization you are talking about.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","And what did they say to you about these major ``too big to fail'' lenders getting heavily into no- document and low-document loans?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Well, we were never the leader in no-document and low-document loans. We did do some of it. The whole Alt A market, by definition, was a lower-documentation market and it was a loan product that mostly was sold into secondary markets. When I got and became Comptroller in 2005, we began to see the creeping situation where there were a number of layers of risk that were being added to all sorts of loans that we--our examiners were seeing, and that caused us to issue guidance on nontraditional mortgages, like payment option mortgages, which we were quite aggressively talking about the negative amortization in it as being not a good thing for the system, and that again we were quite vocal about pushing out of the national banks that were doing it.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, let me ask you, you have twice been criticized by your own Inspector General for keeping, quote, ``a light touch,'' light for too long when banks under your watch were getting in trouble. And I know you have consistently told us that you like to do things informally and in private with your banks. Do you think that changing that strategy makes sense in light of what we have gone through now?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I think I would say two things. The Inspector General does material loss reviews on all the agencies with respect to any bank that has more than a $25 million loss, and it is a good process, a healthy process, and we accept that constructive criticism. And they have talked about places where we could have moved more quickly with respect to a couple of institutions, and we agreed with that. What I would say is we have, as supervisors, a range of tools that we can use that are both informal tools that Congress has given us and formal enforcement tools. And on that spectrum, we do different things depending on the circumstances to try to get actions and behavior corrected. And merely because something is not formal and public does not mean that we are not paying attention or getting things addressed or fixed. Many times--many times--because we are on-site, have the presence, identify a problem, we can get things corrected quickly and efficiently without the need to go to a formal enforcement action. But we will not hesitate, if we have to, to take that action to fix those things. So I think there are things that we constantly look about to correct and to improve our supervision using that range of tools.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Mr. Chairman, if I may have just one more moment?",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Just following up on the Senator's question, how many of those banks did you find that violated your guidelines? And if so, what were the punishments you meted out for them? Looking back, do you think you missed any of the violations?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","It would range from things we have something that--if we see something early, any kind of bank examination that you go through, there are certain kinds of violations of law. Some are less serious and some are more serious. And at one end of the spectrum, we do something called ``Matters requiring attention,'' which tells the directors we expect you to fix this and we want it fixed by the next time we come in.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Jump to the more serious ones.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Well, on that point, we saw 123 of them in that 4-year period, and we got 109 of them corrected within that period.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Were there punishments meted out?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Oh, yes. Not for those things, but we have other situations in which we took actions for mortgage fraud, for other kinds of mortgage-related actions where we had problems, and we have provided some statistics that I could certainly get that we have compiled for the enforcement hearing where we are testifying tomorrow.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I am sorry, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","No. Thank you, Senator Dodd. I appreciate it. Just one more line of questioning. You know, we had a witness before the Committee, Professor McCoy of the University of Connecticut School of Law, and she made some statements that were, you know, pretty alarming to me. She said, ``The OCC has asserted that national banks made only 10 percent of subprime loans in 2006. But this assertion fails to mention that national banks moved aggressively into Alternate-A low-documentation and no-documentation loans during the housing boom.'' ``Unlike OTS, the OCC did promulgate one rule in 2004 prohibiting mortgages to borrowers who could not afford to pay. However, the rule was vague in design and execution, allowing lax lending to proliferate at national banks and their mortgage lending subsidiaries through 2007.'' ``Despite the 2004 rules, through 2007, large national banks continued to make large quantities of poorly underwritten subprime loans and low- and no-documentation loans.'' ``The five largest U.S. banks in 2005 were all national banks and too big to fail. They too made heavy inroads into low- and no-documentation loans.'' And so it just seems to me that some of the biggest bank failures have been under your agency's watch, and they, too, involved thrifts heavily into nil documents, low documents, Alternate A, and nontraditionals, and it is hard to make the case that we had an adequate job of oversight given those results. We have heard a lot here about one of our problems is regulatory arbitrage. Don't you think that they chose your agency because they thought they would get a better break?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I do not and, Senator, I would be happy to respond to those specific allegations, and there are a number of them that were raised. I looked at that testimony, and there are a number of statistics which we flatly disagree with and that were compiled in a way that actually do not give a true picture of what was happening and what was not happening. National banks increasingly have been involved in the supervision of mortgage loans. There is no doubt about that. But I would say that we have done a good job in that area--not perfect, but we think we have excellent, on-the-ground supervisors in that area, and it did not lead to all the kinds of problems in national banks, from national banks, that is----",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","Well, I will submit the question for the record because the Chairman has been very generous with my time, but one of the things I would ask you is: What are you doing in comparison to State regulators who, in fact-- regulators of State depositories who, in fact, have much better performance rates, considerable better than yours?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Actually, that is not true. I have seen that chart, and I will provide----",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","OK. So I would love to either sit down with you to get all that information----",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I would welcome that.",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","----so we can dispel is not the case. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Let me follow up on that, because it is a very important line of questioning. There were hundreds of thousands, we know now, of bad loans. Hundreds of thousands of them. You talk about 123 violations. I do not just focus the question on the OCC but also the FDIC, the OTS, the Fed. What was your experience? Obviously, Dan, you were not there at the time, but I would like to get some information, if I could, from the Fed as to what was going on. When you consider the hundreds of thousands of bad loans that are the root cause of why we are here today, the reason we are sitting here today is because of what happened under that framework and that time, going back 4 or 5 years ago, longer maybe. And so we have hundreds of thousands of bad loans that were issued, and it is awfully difficult to explain to people that out of that quantity, 123 violations are identified.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Well, let me say two things. One, I was referring to one particular kind of violation. There are others that we will be happy to submit for the record. But I think the more fundamental point is this: There were many of these loans that did not violate the law. They were just underwritten in a way with easier standards than they had been historically. And that was not necessarily a legal violation, but a prudential--",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","But shouldn't that have raised a red flag? You are the experts in this area, and you were watching people get loans with no documentation, these liar loans and so forth. Was anyone watching?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","People were watching. I think what drove that initially--my own personal view on this--is that most of those loans were sold into the secondary market. They were not loans held on the books of the institutions that originated them. And so for someone to sell it and get rid of the risk, it did not look like it was something that was presenting the same kind of risk to the institution. And if you go back and look at the time when house prices were rising and there were not high default rates on it, people were making the argument that these things are a good thing and provide more loans to more people. It made our examiners uncomfortable. We eventually, I think too late, came around to the view that it was a practice that should not occur, and that is exactly why I was talking earlier, if we could do one thing--two things that we should have done as an underwriting standard earlier is, one, the low- documentation loans and the other is the decline in downpayments.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I want to ask the other panelists here with regard to Senator Menendez's line of questioning. The guidance is not on the securitization of those loans or what happens with rating agencies. The guidance is on the origination of the loans, which is clearly the responsibility of the OCC. And so the fact that these things were sold later on is a point I take, but your responsibility is in origination, and origination involved this kind of behavior. I appreciate you providing us with numbers in one area, but I assume there are more numbers you can give us in other areas. I do not think you can get away by suggesting--I say this respectfully to you-- that because they have not been held at the institution--as most of us here have a little gray hair on our head and have had our mortgage for years that you could not notice changes in the way mortgages were originated. On the other hand, when mortgages are kept with originators and you could look at them for 30 years if you wanted.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Right.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Obviously that is all changed. But your responsibility falls into origination, which is a very different question than what happens in terms of whether or not the mortgage is held at the institution or sold.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I totally agree with that point. The point I was really trying to make was we had a market where the securitization market got very powerful.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","It was buying loans from people in the marketplace, standards reduced, particularly from nonbank brokers and mortgage originators that were providing those. Banks were competing with them, and people were not at that time suffering very significant losses on those loans because house prices were going up. And I think----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You cannot just look at losses. Is the practice acceptable?",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","I understand that, and I believe that we were too late getting to the notion, all of us, about getting at stated income practices and low-documentation loans. We did get to it, but it was after the horse had left the barn in a number of cases, and we should have gotten there earlier. The point I was just trying to make to you, though, is that as these things were leaving the institution, they were less of a risk to that institution from a safety and soundness point of view.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","We are going back around. Chairman Bair, let me ask you to comment on this as well.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I think John is right. These practices became far too pervasive. For the most part, the smaller State- chartered banks we regulate did not do this type of lending they do more traditional lending, and then obviously they do commercial real estate lending, which had a separate set of issues. We had one specialty lender who we ordered out of the business in February of 2007. There have been a few others. We have had some other actions, and I would have to go back to the examination staff to get the details for you. But I was also concerned that even after the guidance on the nontraditional mortgages, which quite specifically said you are not going to do low-doc and no-doc anymore, that we still had very weak underwriting in 2007. So I think that is a problem that all of us should look back on and try to figure out, because clearly by 2007 we knew this was epidemic in proportion, and the underwriting standards did not improve as well as you would have thought they should have, and the performance of those loans had been very poor as well. I do think we need to do a lot more----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, quickly the Fed and the OTS. I know it is a little difficult to ask you this question, Dan, because you were not there at the time, but any response to this point?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I do not, Senator, except as an external observer. But anything that you would like from the Fed, if you just----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, it might be helpful to find out whether or not there were violations, and punishments meted out at all. Again, many of us have heard over the last couple of years the complaint is that Congress in 1994 passed the HOEPA legislation which mandated that the Federal Reserve promulgate regulations to deal with fraudulent and deceptive residential mortgage practices. Not a single regulation was ever promulgated until the last year or so, and obviously that is seen as a major gap in terms of the responsibility of moving forward. OTS quickly, do you have any----",Speech, 
"Mr. Polakoff","Mr. Chairman, you are right. The private label securitization market, we could have done a better job in looking at the underwriting as those loans passed off the institution's books and into a securitization process. Yes, sir.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Menendez, do you want to make any further comment on this point or not?",Speech, 
"Senator Menendez","I think, Mr. Chairman, you are on the road--you know, to me--and I know Mr. Tarullo was not there, but the Federal Reserve, you know, is at the forefront of what needed to be done because they had the ability to set the standard. And the lack of doing so, you know, is a major part of the challenge that we are facing today. But I appreciate it and I look forward to the follow-up.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Bunning.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. I hurried back, and I heard that Senator Menendez asked my question, but that is all right. This is for Sheila. I am not used to angry bankers. I have had a great relationship with the Kentucky Association and their leaders, but I did a roundtable discussion in Paducah, Kentucky. Paducah, Kentucky, is a town of about 29,000 people. Two community bankers. One came to me and said, ``We have just been assessed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and guess what? We will not be profitable in 2009 because of that assessment.'' No bad loans, no nothing. No bad securities. They keep their mortgages in-house. Everything just like community bankers in most places do. There was a gentleman from BB&T. Now, that is not a community bank. That is a much larger bank. The assessment for the community bank was $800,000, wiped out their total profitability. BB&T was $1.2 million. Now, that did not wipe out their profitability because they have many banks all over the country. But how can you explain to the American people that for doing your job and doing it well, you are being assessed your total profitability in 1 year to pay for those who did not do their job very well? Maybe you can explain that to me because I do not understand it.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, deposit insurance has always been funded by industry assessments. The FDIC actually has never--we do have the full faith and credit of the U.S. Government backing us. We do have lines of credit----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","There are a lot of other ways that you could have done it.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, sir, all banks that get deposit insurance pay for it. It is an expense that they need to factor in. And we have been signaling for some time that we will need to raise premiums. We are in a much more distressed economic environment. Our loss projections are going up, and I think most community banks agree that we should continue our industry-funded self-sufficiency and not turn to taxpayers. We did not want to do the 20-basis-point special assessment, but our loss projections are going up significantly, and we felt it was necessary to maintain an adequate cushion above zero.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","For this one community bank, it was a 1,000-percent increase in their assessment.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Well, I would be happy to go over those numbers with you.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","I will be glad to go over them, because she did. She went over them with me.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","OK. We would like to see that, because they are miscalculating what the assessment is. I would say the base assessment is 12 to 16 basis points. The interim special assessment is 20 basis points. It is out for comment. It has not been finalized yet. We are hoping that through increasing our borrowing authority we can----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Don't you have a line of credit with the Treasury? It seems like everybody else does, so I would assume that you do.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","We do. It is pretty low. It has not been raised since 1991, and we are working with Chairman Dodd and Senator Crapo to get it raised. But I would say the FDIC has never borrowed from Treasury to cover our losses. We have only borrowed once in our entire history. That was for short-term borrowing.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","We can print you some money. I mean, what the heck. It is printed by----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Yesterday, our Chairman of the Fed announced $1.2 trillion--not billion but trillion dollars of printed money going out.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Right.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","It is just scary.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","That is a policy call. I think a lot of community banks--Ken Guenther had an excellent blog yesterday he has obviously been long associated with community bankers-- suggesting that it would not be in community bankers' interest, because right now they are not tarnished with the bailout brush. But if the FDIC starts going to taxpayers for our funding instead of relying on our industry assessments, I think that perception could change. We are working very hard to reduce the special assessment. I have already said that if the borrowing authority is increased, we feel we can reduce it meaningfully. This week we approved a surcharge to a debt guarantee program we have that is heavily used by large institutions. We will put that surcharge into our deposit insurance fund and also use that to offset the 20-basis-point assessment. So we are working hard to get it down. We want to get it down. But I do think the principle of industry funding is important to the history of the FDIC, and I think it is important to the reputation and confidence of community banks that they are not getting taxpayer assistance. They continue to stand behind their fund.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, that all sounds really well and good. I would like to take you to that roundtable and let you--",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Senator, I have personally----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","----explain that to those two bankers.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","I have talked to a lot of community bankers about this. I absolutely have. I would also like to share numbers with you, though, that show deposit insurance, even with the special assessments, is still very cheap compared to alternative sources of funding. Even with the special assessments, it is much cheaper than any other sources of funding that they would have to tap into.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","You have taken up all my time. I cannot ask another question--may I?",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Sure.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","OK. The gentleman from the Federal Reserve is here. Thank you for being here. Do you or anybody else at the Fed have concerns about the Fed being the systemic risk regulator or payment system regulator? And where would you say would be the right place to place that task?",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, with respect to payment systems, I think there is a fair consensus at the Fed that some formal legal authority to regulate payment systems is important to have. As you probably know, de facto right now the Fed is able to exercise supervisory authority over payment systems. That is because of the peculiarity of the fact that the entities concerned are member banks of the Federal Reserve System. They have got supervisory authority. If their corporate form were to change, there would be some question about it, and payments, as you know, are historically and importantly related to the operation of the financial system. Now, with respect to the systemic risk regulator, I think there is much less final agreement on either one of the questions that I think are implicit in what you asked. One, what should a systemic risk regulator do precisely? And, two, who should do it? The one thing I would say--and I think this bears repeating, so I will look for occasions to say it again--is however the Congress comes down on this issue, I think that we need all to be clear, you need to be clear in the legislation, whoever you delegate tasks to needs to be clear, not just what exactly the authorities are, which is important, but also the expectations are, because we need to be clear as to what we think can be accomplished. You do not want to give responsibility without authority----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, sometimes we give the responsibility and the authority----",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","And it is not used, just the 1994 law when we handed the Fed the responsibility and it was 14 years before they promulgated one rule or regulation.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I agree. Believe me, Senator. That is something that I observed myself before I was in my present job. So I have got no----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","No, I am not faulting you, but I am just stating the fact that even when we are sometimes very clear in our demand that certain people regulate certain things, they have to take the ball and carry it then.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Absolutely. Absolutely correct. And so on the systemic risk regulator issue, there is a strong sense that if there is to be a systemic risk regulator, the Federal Reserve needs to be involved because of our function as lender of last resort, because of the mission of protecting financial stability. How that function is structured seems to me something that is open-ended because the powers in question need to be decided by the Congress. Let me give you one example of that. It is very important that there be consolidated supervision of every systemically important institution. So with bank holding companies, that is not a problem, because we have already got that authority. But there are other institutions out there currently unregulated over which no existing agency has prudential, safety and soundness, supervisory authority.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","You realize that your two Chairmen came to us and told us that certain entities----",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Right, absolutely.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","----should not be regulated.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I am sorry. Which entity----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Well, credit default swaps and other things that are related to that. Your past Chairman and your current Chairman.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","OK, so I can--let me get to credit default swaps in a moment, but let me try to address the institution issue, because it is the case that we believe consolidated supervision is important for each institution. A consolidated--",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","We maybe should make a regulator for each institution.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","If there is a good prudential regulator for each systemically important institution, then you would not need a systemic regulator to fulfill that----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","That is correct.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I think that is----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","And we also would not have people too big to fail.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, you would hope that the regulation, including a resolution mechanism and the like, would be such as to contain that----",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","That is what I mean.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Yes, exactly, Senator.",Speech, 
"Senator Bunning","Thank you.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","OK, sure.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thanks, Senator Bunning, for the question, I am not going to ask you to respond to this because I have taken a lot of your time already today, not to mention there was a little confusion with the votes we have had. But we want to define what we mean when we talk about a systemic risk regulator. Do you mean regulating institutions that are inherently systemically risky or important? Or are you talking about regulating systemically risky practices that institutions can engage in? Or are you talking about regulating or setting up a resolution structure so that when you have institutions like AIG and Lehman Brothers, you have got an alternative other than just pumping capital into them, as we did in the case of AIG? I get uneasy about the fact that the Fed is the lender of last resort. Simultaneously the Fed now also falls into the capacity of being particularly in the last function, the resolution operation. It seems to me you get, like in the thrift crisis years ago, the regulator becomes also the one that also deals with these resolutions. I think that is an inherently dangerous path to go down. That is my instinct.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Let me just take 30 seconds, Senator. That little litany you had I think is right. I would just add one thing to it. You have got supervision of systemically important institutions not currently subject to supervision.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","That could be one role.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","That is one role. The second role, which you also identified, practices that are pervasive in an industry, no matter what the size of the entity, which rise to the level of posing true systemic risk--probably unusual, but certainly possible.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","And I think we have seen it in the last couple of years. Third is the resolution mechanism you spoke about. It seems to me that should not be included within the definition of system risk regulator. You could, under some configurations, have the same entity doing those two functions. I think what you would need is to ensure that the systemic regulator had a role in the decisions on resolving systemically important institutions, as Chairman Bair pointed out, such as under the systemic risk exception in the FDI Act that already exists. The fourth function that I would add is the monitoring one. I understand that is a prerequisite for some of the other ones we talked about, but it also serves an independent purpose, and I think, if I am not mistaken, this is some of what Senator Reed has been getting at in the past--the need to focus on issues and get them out, get them discussed and get them reported.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","So I think that is your choice, that you have got four functions there. My sense is that the resolution issue is not necessarily----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","You could be right. And your fourth point, the private sector model where you have the official or the officer in the business doing the risk assessment. As I understand it, in a lot of these entities, they do not have the capacity to shut something down on their own except in very extreme cases. But they will advise the individuals who are engaging in that thing that their behavior is posing risks to their company. So it does not have the ability to say no, but it has the power or at least the information to warn. I am a little uneasy about that because it just seems to me whether or not you are going to get the decisions that actually would shut things down when they arise. There are too many dots to connect to reach that point of shutting something down before it poses even greater risk.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, but you do, I think, Mr. Chairman, want--again, this is why it is important for Congress ultimately to decide what scope of authorities it wants somewhere, and then figure out where the best place to put them is. But that does require us all to make this judgment as to how broadly we want authority reaching and under what circumstances. As you can tell from my testimony, our view is that you do not want to displace the regular prudential supervision of all the agencies.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","No.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","This should be something which is an oversight mechanism on top of it in the general course of things. But as I think you have pointed out, you will sometimes have practices--and subprime mortgage lending that was either predatory or not well backed by good underwriting is a principal example--that became pervasive and should have been regulated earlier.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","I have said over and over again I am sort of agnostic on all of this. I want to do what works. But if you ask me where I was inclining, it is on that point. I think you have got to watch practices. Just because something is called important does not mean it is. And there may be practices that may not seem important but are terribly important. And it seems to me we ought to be focusing on that, not at the exclusion of the other. Let me ask the other panelists quickly to comment if they have--any comments on this from anyone else on this discussion? Sheila, do you have----",Speech, 
"Mr. Fryzel","I just have one comment. If the Congress takes the action and puts in place a systemic regulator, that is certainly not going to stop or prevent some of the problems that we have now out in the financial services industry. As Chairman Bair talked about, the fact that she has asked for an increase in the lending from the Treasury, as we have at NCUA, which is paramount to us taking care of the problems between now and the time the systemic risk regulator is able to take over and watch over all of our industries. So that there are tools that we are going to be coming back to the Congress for between now and then that the regulators are going to need to solve the problems that are existing out there now. We still need things to get those solved.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Sheila, do you want to comment?",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","Yes, I would--I agree with what you said about practices. I would only add that, to some extent, they are connected in that if the Federal Government or the agencies do not have the ability both to write rules--which we did have-- and enforce those rules for all institutions, you still get the kind of dynamic we had with mortgages where it started with the nonbanks creating competitive pressure on the banks to respond in kind. And another thing that--you do not have the SEC and the CFTC here, but I think any discussion of regulatory restructuring needs to note the need for market regulation of the derivatives markets, especially the CDS markets.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","We do not have a table big enough.",Speech, 
"Ms. Bair","That is not institution-specific, absolutely, but it is another area.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","But I must say, I was sitting here looking at this and we are missing the CFTC and the SEC at this table. But in a sense, and I say this very respectfully, this is the problem. With all due respect, this is the problem. In a sense, we talk about too big to fail in the sense of private institutions. But in a sense, we have a bureaucracy or a regulatory structure and so forth, that is too big to succeed because it is so duplicative. And I can understand there is a value in that, in terms of protecting some things, but we are having the SEC next week testify before the Committee. But if I wanted to capture in a photograph what is the essence of the problem, I can't. And this is the problem. And this is what we've got to sort out in a way that provides some clarity to the process as we go forward. By the way, there is going to be a hearing at 2 o'clock--I know that is what all of you want to hear--on deposit insurance that Senator Johnson is hosting in 538 of the Dirksen Building.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","That will be good news for our panelists, we know I have got to wrap up here as we are getting near 2 o'clock. We are going to proceed on this, I would say to Chairman Bair as well, and we are trying to resolve some other issues, if we can, in going forward. I know you are aware of that. Obviously, we are very interested in getting the legislation adopted, and we will move quickly. Any other further comment on this last point? And then I want to end, if not? Yes, John.",Speech, 
"Mr. Dugan","Senator, I would just agree with your point. It is not obvious that, in many cases, the gathering of the information is not really the most important thing you need to do. For example, if you had hedge funds, it is not clear you would want to go in and regulate them like you regulate a bank. You might want to find out what they were doing, how they were doing it, have some authority to take some action if you had to. But the gathering of information, understanding what they do, was completely absent during the current crisis with respect to nonbanks, and it is a really important thing that you are talking about, to learn what people are doing. So that is a fundamental building block.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. I can see you chafing. Go ahead, Governor.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","Just one point on that. This is what I meant earlier about being clear about where they go, where authority----",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","We need the mic on.",Speech, 
"Mr. Tarullo","I am sorry. Because if you say you are a systemic risk regulator, you are responsible for everything, no matter where it may happen. But there is not a regular system in place for overseeing a particular market or overseeing particular institutions. That is when I think you risk having things falling between the cracks and expectations not being met. And so I come back to the point I opened with, that is why there needs to be an agenda for systemic stability which takes into account each of the roles that the various agencies will play.",Speech, 
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I thank you. There are additional questions I will submit for the record, and I know my colleagues will, as well. We are going to be very engaged with all of you over the coming weeks on this matter. As I said, we have got more hearings to hold on this, the SEC next week. We have had seven already. And I thank each and every one of you for your participation. It has been very, very helpful here this morning. The Committee will stand adjourned.",Speech,
