"Chairman Watt","This hearing of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology will come to order. We will proceed with opening statements up to 10 minutes per side, and I will recognize myself for a brief opening statement. This hearing is entitled, ``Regulatory Restructuring: Safeguarding Consumer Protection and the Role of the Federal Reserve.'' This is the second in a series of hearings about financial regulatory reform and the role of the Federal Reserve, the second in this subcommittee, that is. The first hearing, held on July 9th, examined how to balance the Federal Reserve's existing role as the independent authority on monetary policy with its proposed role as systemic risk regulator under the Administration's financial regulatory reform proposal. Today's hearing examines a different aspect of the Administration's regulatory reform proposal, the proposed Consumer Financial Protection Agency (CFPA). While the full Financial Services Committee has held a hearing--or a series of hearings, for that matter--on the CFPA, this hearing will drill down further and examine some of the public policy and operational considerations related to the proposed CFPA, including whether the Federal Reserve should maintain a role in consumer protection, given its current responsibilities for writing rules, supervising institutions, and enforcing the Nation's consumer protection laws, and if so, what that role should be and how it might be coordinated with, supportive of, or at least not in conflict with the new CFPA. Although no witnesses from other Federal banking agencies are testifying today, this hearing may also touch upon how the same set of questions should be answered with respect to their consumer protection roles and their interactions with the CFPA. Today there is no single agency focused solely on protecting consumers from products and services that could be detrimental to their financial health. Since the idea of having a single Consumer Financial Protection Agency was advanced by Harvard Law School Professor Elizabeth Warren, other academics, commentators, Members of Congress, and regular citizens have embraced the idea. They have witnessed the way that our fragmented regulatory system produced serious gaps in regulation and oversight and failed to have anyone whose highest priority was protecting consumers, that is, someone who goes to work every day with that as their single most important objective. Others, of course, criticize the idea of a single consumer protection agency as adding another layer of regulation. There can be no doubt that regulatory gaps helped create an environment for toxic financial products such as predatory mortgages and other abuses that helped cause the current financial crisis. To remedy this, the Administration has proposed placing focused authority in the proposed CFPA to administer the Nation's consumer protection laws. As Congress and President Obama work to enact financial regulatory reform, it is critical for us to examine the public policy rationale for vesting virtually all authority for consumer protection of financial products in a single agency. Also, as a matter of public policy, we will examine whether and how the Federal Reserve can effectively balance its responsibilities to execute monetary policy, take on a new role in systemic regulation, and if it continued to have this role, protect consumers effectively. For far too long, consumer protection has been an afterthought. I hope that the record developed at today's hearing will offer further support for the elevation of consumer protection to be on equal footing with prudential and safety and soundness regulation. We also hope that today's hearing testimony will begin to address some of the questions surrounding the operational details of the proposed consumer protection agency, including coordination between and among Federal regulators and State regulators so that there is effective and efficient regulation of the Nation's consumer protection laws in the financial services area, as many believe we have in the food and product safety area. With that, I will recognize the gentleman from Texas, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Mr. Ron Paul, for, I guess, up to 10 minutes or as much time as--I guess, 6 minutes; 6 minutes is what I have been told.","Speech",""
"Dr. Paul","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding these hearings because I think they are very important. The subject of consumer protection and the role of the Federal Reserve is, to me, a very important issue. I look at this somewhat differently than others because they talk about consumer protection, and they are thinking about financial products and services, credit cards and gift cards and that if there is any harm done to the consumer, that just additional regulation will handle this. But I think there is a much bigger issue related to the consumer and the Federal Reserve, something I think is neglected in a serious manner. For instance, the Federal Reserve has something to do with the value of our money, and the Federal Reserve has been around since 1913 and now we are working on a 4-cent dollar. So the systematic destruction of the value of our money has not helped our consumers; our consumers are destroyed by the loss of their purchasing power. The fact that the Federal Reserve regulates interest rates and gets them down to 1 or 2 percent, so if you happen to be a saver and you are in retirement and you put money away, you get punished. Maybe the market would say that the interest rates ought to be 5 percent or 6 percent or 7 percent, if you are a saver. But we punish them, and this has to do with the regulations and manipulations going on with the Federal Reserve. So the Federal Reserve is hardly a protector of the consumer when it distorts the interest rate that is paid to the savers, and they are the consumers. Think about how the consumer was protected with the collapse of the financial bubble. The financial bubble--it is well-known the financial bubbles come from inflating the money supply, lower interest rates, malinvestment, too much debt. The source of all this mischief comes from the Federal Reserve, and who suffers? The consumer. Who benefits? The people who had been making bundles on Wall Street and the bankers, for years when the bubble is being built, and then all of the sudden the bubble bursts, and who gets punished? The little guy gets punished. He loses trillions and trillions of dollars in value. Who gets bailed out? Goldman Sachs. And we pretend that the Federal Reserve is going to protect the consumer when the consumer is being destroyed under these conditions. Think about the consequence of the collapse of the bubble that has been artificially created. Who suffers? It is the consumer, the people who lose their jobs, the poor people, the middle class. This type of system that we have today, historically it is well-known if we pursue it, and we are pursuing it, because the middle class gets wiped out. Look at all of the inflations throughout history, all of the paper moneys of history. The middle class eventually gets wiped out because the value goes down. And the people who suffer the most aren't the people on Wall Street; the people who suffer the most are the middle class. They lose their jobs. They lose their houses. And I just think that as well intended as this is, to have more regulations to protect the consumer with their financial products and their other services--maybe it will help a little, but if you don't address the subject of how the consumer is destroyed, it won't help. Mexico has gone through this quite a few times with the destruction of currency. Who gets wiped out? The middle class. They are all holding pesos. The peso goes to the dogs. The middle class gets wiped out. Now, and I have had correspondence and meetings with members of congress from Mexico, and now they have a savings account in Mexico where if you are frightened about the destruction of currency, you can actually go in and have a savings account in silver. That is--they are trying to help protect the consumer. But here in this country, if you happen to want to use silver and gold as legal tender, you go to jail, even though the Constitution tells us exactly what to say. So, ultimately, these--this process will work its way through the progress and there will be another consumer protection agency, but it is not going to do a whole lot until we address the subject of how do you protect the little guy, the middle class, by having honest money and not allowing the monetary system to inflate at will behind closed doors and to benefit special interests. This is what has been happening for a long time. Some day, we are going to have a revelation and find out that when we open up the books and find out every agreement that was ever made between the Federal Reserve and Goldman Sachs and have it on the record, maybe then we will find out how we can protect the consumer and not have a system that protects all the wealthy on Wall Street as well as those individuals who happen to work for Goldman Sachs. I yield back the balance of my time.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, a member of the subcommittee, is recognized for 3 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","The Federal Reserve is a very powerful government agency exercising government power. The proposal now is to give them a lot more power. In a constitutional democracy we have one person, one vote. The executive branch is headed by the President and all important executive branch appointees are appointed by the President or appointed by the President's appointees. There is one incredible and offensive exception. That is the Federal Reserve where, at the regional bank, a majority are selected and, ultimately, on the Federal Open Market Committee, perhaps the most important government agency we have, a majority of the power is in the hands of one bank, one vote. Or should I say, ``one big bank, one big vote;'' ``one small bank, one small vote?'' This is an affront to the Constitution which will be exacerbated if we transfer more power to the Federal Reserve without mandating that all its Governors be appointees of those who are elected by the voters. It is a testament to the power of the banks that such incredible governmental power is invested in agencies where the voters don't decide who are the Governors. I realize the Federal Reserve Board of Governors is appointed, but those regional slots and the Open Market Committee are very important centers of government power. Second, the ranking member on this committee has a bill which I have cosponsored to audit the Federal Reserve. It is absurd to have a government agency with this kind of power be the agency immune from such audits. And finally, there is the idea of, where do we put consumer protection? Right now, we have a Federal Reserve where the banks choose the majority of those on the regional boards and on the Federal Open Market Committee, and then we are told that is the agency that will protect consumers from the banks. No other industry has that much power to select its regulators. Finally, if the Fed is going to be the systemic risk regulator, we have to recognize that ripping off consumers is one way to ameliorate systemic risk because if you can double- cycle bill, you can get the banks a little bit more healthy, and maybe they will survive their stress tests. We can't put those responsible for the stress test on the one hand with the responsibility for protecting consumers on the other. And I don't care how healthy you can make the banks with credit card rip-offs, we ought to prevent those credit card rip-offs, we ought to prevent those credit card rip-offs because ripping off the consumer is not the best way to make the banks healthy. I yield back.","Speech"," "

"Mr. Bachus","I thank the chairman. I thank you for convening this hearing on consumer protection and the role of the Federal Reserve. And I would like to personally welcome Governor Elizabeth Duke. I guess ``welcome'' is a good word. You are welcome. Obviously, you have a difficult task any time you face a subcommittee. And I am not sure who selected you as the one to come up here, but I think it was a very capable decision. At one point in her distinguished career, she was the head of the community banking for one of our long-based Birmingham banks. And I thank you for being here. As we heard in this morning's hearing, and it is likely to come out in this hearing, proponents of the Administration's proposal to create a Consumer Financial Protection Agency are contending that there was a massive failure in consumer protection on the part of the Federal Reserve, and that failure led to the collapse of the global economy. I think that is an oversimplification and unduly unjust criticism. And there is lots to criticize about the Fed's response to the growth and the collapse of the subprime mortgage market, as well as the agency's handling of the credit crisis and the turmoil in the financial markets. In addition, we all agree that comprehensive reform of our financial regulatory system is needed. But I think it is, or should be, clear to all of us that last September, the challenges that the central bank faced were without precedent and that Chairman Bernanke and the Federal Reserve, in combination with the other regulators, the Administration, and the Congress acted with good intentions, and I believe averted a much more catastrophic economic collapse. I am not sure this Congress and the people we represent fully realize that they did some very good work. Both the Democrats' regulatory reform proposal and a plan we have put forth strips the Federal Reserve of its consumer protection mandate. And it does that although--with both the subprime lending regulations in 2007, and the credit card regulations of the Fed advanced in 2008 were very good. In fact, in a bipartisan way, both the chairman of the full committee and I as ranking member and most of the members complimented you on that work and, I think, had--I think they were very good. The difference in the Republican plan is that it streamlines and consolidates the functions of the four bank regulators, including consumer protection, into a single umbrella agency; and this creates clear lines of accountability and prevents regulatory authorities from passing the buck. In contrast, the Democrats' plan adds a massive new layer of bureaucracy with broad undefined and arbitrary powers to a brand-new agency with absolutely no experience. It is a plan that continues the kind of turf battles that undermine rather than promote effective consumer protection. In closing, let me say that I understand that Governor Duke will be suggesting some other approaches and I think other approaches probably will carry the day, given the Fed's extensive regulatory expertise and their recent successes in this regard, we have a responsibility to carefully consider them and judge them on the merits. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his statement. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized for 2 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I do want to associate myself with some of the comments made by the ranking member of the full committee. I appreciate what you said about averting the catastrophe that the country was facing and that we did some good here in Congress by working with the Fed and helping. I think that was important. And I think that Mr. Bernanke has done a good job, an outstanding job, and I salute him for what he has done. He has been very much amiable and amicable in terms of working with the Congress, to the extent that he can without surrendering his autonomy, and I don't expect him to do this. I think the Fed has an awesome task. Right now we are talking about systemic risk regulation. You currently deal with setting and executing monetary policy, and now we are looking at the possibility of adding consumer protection. With reference to your consumer protection function currently, you deal with supervision and enforcement, complaint investigation, rule-making, consumer education, as well as community development. You did promulgate some rules that were, I think, of benefit with reference to dealing with credit card practices; the rule that relates to the 45-day notice, I thought was of benefit; prohibiting double-cycle billing was beneficial; and I think that the way that you have put in place the allocation of payments with reference to interest rates, when the interest rates can vary, I think that is a benefit too. But my concern is, candidly speaking, that these things are done in a reactive way. Congress was about to do something, and I think the Fed judiciously and prudently gave us a very good reaction to what was about to become congressional action. And I am concerned that we don't--we won't have a proactive entity if we have this in the hands of the Fed. So I welcome your comments later to help me to understand better how this will become a proactive initiative, if you have it, as opposed to reactive. I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I yield back.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his opening statement. Without objection, all members' opening statements will be made a part of the record. And now, I will proceed with the introduction of our witnesses. Our first witness, the only witness on this panel, is the Honorable Elizabeth A. Duke, Governor, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Without objection, of course, Ms. Duke, your written statement will be made a part of the record, and you will be recognized for a 5-minute summary of your testimony. There is a lighting system that you are very familiar with; you have been here before. When it goes to yellow, you will have 1 more minute; and then we will--I am pretty generous in trying to hear our witnesses, because I think that is more important than hearing ourselves sometimes. So we will give you a little slack if you run over. So you are recognized for 5 minutes, and you may proceed with your testimony.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I will try to be mindful of my time. Chairman Watt, Ranking Member Paul, and members of the subcommittee, I appreciate the opportunity to appear today to discuss regulatory restructuring and the role of the Federal Reserve Board in consumer protection. The members of the Federal Reserve Board are in strong agreement with the Administration that a fundamental lesson of the financial crisis is that we need to do a better job for consumers of financial products. While arguments for consolidating consumer protection functions may be compelling, it is important to also consider the substantial opportunities presented by existing arrangements. In our view, the Federal Reserve has the resources and the experience to execute an ongoing, comprehensive program for effective consumer protection in financial services. Our team of seasoned professionals and specialists focus exclusively on the panoply of activities that, taken together, can most effectively protect consumers; however, their work is augmented by supplemental expertise in market research and supervision from within the Board and the 12 regional Reserve Banks. We believe that replicating in another agency the full array of functions that support our consumer protection program would be enormously challenging. A report outlining our extensive program and recent actions is provided to my written testimony. We also view consumer protection as complementary to, rather than in conflict with, the other functions of the Federal Reserve, such as prudential supervision and financial stability. These missions enforce one another. For example, sound underwriting benefits consumers as well as institutions, and strong consumer protections can add certainty to the markets and reduce risk to the financial system. We have demonstrated, particularly in the recent years with which I am most familiar, our commitment and capacity to effectively execute our congressionally assigned consumer protection responsibilities. The Board is also concerned that removing consumer protection responsibilities from the Federal Reserve would weaken the consumer perspective that currently exists in our monetary and supervisory policy discussions. It is appropriate and beneficial that the central bank has a mission that includes an analytical and nuanced understanding of developments in the consumer marketplace. For these reasons, we stand ready to work with this subcommittee and others in Congress to help identify ways to further strengthen our consumer protection program institutionally. As Congress considers regulatory reform, one option that might be considered would be to retain the Federal Reserve's consumer protection responsibilities and consider additional policies to strengthen and further reinforce our commitment going forward. Along these lines, I would like to offer some suggestions for how this could be accomplished. First, we believe that enhanced accountability could be achieved by codifying or otherwise institutionalizing consumer protection as a core mission or responsibility for the Federal Reserve, just like monetary policy in bank supervisions. This would provide a clear and ongoing understanding that consumer protection matters are an integral part of the Federal Reserve's overall mission. Second, Congress could require the Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board to annually report regarding the state of consumer protection, similar to the semiannual monetary policy reports to the Congress. Such reporting could include a comprehensive review of the Federal Reserve's actions taken to strengthen consumer protection, planned future actions to address potentially unfair and deceptive acts and practices, a review of enforcement actions, studies of consumer finances, availability of financial services, especially in underserved areas or other matters as requested by the Congress. Third, we plan to conduct periodic sufficiency reviews of consumer regulations and policies. These reviews will consider emerging trends in consumer financial services, whether existing regulations are adequate for protecting consumers, and identify those areas in which new consumer protection measures are needed. We will develop a process that includes regular public hearings in Washington and regional locations around the country similar to the process required by the Credit Card Act of 2009. These findings and recommendations could then be reported to Congress as part of the annual testimony and report discussed previously. Strong, timely and thoughtful consumer protection is critical for the economic health and vitality for our country. We at the Federal Reserve Board remain strongly committed to effectively protecting consumers, and we look forward to continuing to work with Congress on these critical issues. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE ELIZABETH A. DUKE, GOVERNOR, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"
"Chairman Watt","I thank you for your testimony. And I now recognize the members for questioning and I recognize myself for 5 minutes. Ms. Duke, I learn something new in this job every day; and reading your testimony, I learned something new. Both on page 2 and page 17 of your testimony, you indicate that consumer protection was never at the core mission statutorily of your agency. You say, correcting that would help you do consumer protection more. I mean, I am reading it here. I thought you said we should codify consumer protection as a core mission along with our other responsibilities. On page 17, you say, ``codify consumer protection as a core mission or responsibility''--``similar to monetary policy in banking supervision and regulation.'' I didn't realize that consumer protection was dealt with differently than--certainly not banking supervision and regulation; maybe monetary policy, I recognize, is pretty carefully statutorily outlined. Are you saying to me that the Fed has viewed this as a secondary role?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","The monetary policy targets that we have are in the statute. I think the reason that I would suggest that be put into statute, that this be codified, is that there is a perception, whether true or untrue, that consumer protection has taken a lower priority than some of the other functions of the Federal Reserve. At times in our history--","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I can certainly understand the perception, but according to this, it is a reality. Is there something more explicit about banking supervision and regulation and the responsibilities the Fed has for that than there is about consumer protection?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Mr. Chairman, since I have been with the Federal Reserve, it has been my observation that the three are all important in the Federal Reserve. However, over time, the codification of that would simply make it--we would ensure that it remains.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Would you argue with the notion that somebody in our government ought to show up every day with the prime responsibility for protecting or dealing with the issues of consumers in their financial matters?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I wouldn't argue with that at all. In fact, I would hope there is more than one somebody.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Okay. All right. Now, some of the people in the industry have said that if we leave part of this responsibility in the Fed and create this new consumer protection agency, that will lead to conflicts. And I think I started to understand that yesterday, so I am prepared maybe to move it all out of the Fed. That is one possibility of resolving conflicts. Or leave it all in the Fed. But this is all over the place now: It is in the Fed; it is in OTC; it is in a number of different regulatory agencies. And while you have been pretty aggressive about saying that you think that the Fed can do it, I am wondering if you have the same level of confidence in the other regulators who are doing it. Or should we--are you saying that we should continue to leave consumer protection in the Fed, in the OTC, in the other regulators as an alternative for the new agency?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am assuming that your question refers to the examination responsibilities, the supervision responsibilities.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I am talking about protecting consumers, not the examination responsibilities. Do you have to examine an institution to protect consumers?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There are actually two parts to the consumer protection. One part is the rule-writing and the other part is the inspection within the institutions to ensure that all of the rules are being followed. So within the banks, within the banking industry, there are on-site examinations similar to prudential supervision examination, but focused entirely on consumer issues. So to the extent that there would be any conflict between the prudential supervision, the safety and soundness side and the consumer compliance side, as a matter of practice right now within the agencies, because of the day-to-day contact, those are usually resolved in the ordinary course of business.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I think that is another question that I have, but my time has run out and I don't want to abuse it. I actually think this may be a panel that we do a second round of questions, so as not to put the other members at a disadvantage. Let me proceed with recognizing the ranking member for 5 minutes for his questions.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Governor Duke, to our hearing. I find it rather fascinating that we are talking about where the regulations will go, whether it is going to be in the Fed or a new agency. From my viewpoint, I am not sure it makes a whole lot of difference. I think it is the principle of regulation, whether it will work or not. But it is rather ironic that a lot of people are talking about putting them in the Fed with the amount of failure of the Federal Reserve and the amount of noncompliance or at least, an observation by the Congress, its inability to audit makes it sort of ironic that we might give the Federal Reserve even more power. I am concerned about the history of regulation. We don't have a real good record that regulations prevent problems. We have had the SEC around for a long time, and the SEC didn't prevent Enron and so many other bankruptcies and big problems. Then, of course, when we had that failure, we had Sarbanes- Oxley and that hasn't prevented much either. We had a lot of housing regulations. It didn't prevent the housing bubble. It goes on and on. A lot of people think, if you are not a strong endorser of all these regulations, therefore, you think it runs free and there is no regulation. But the regulations come differently; it comes through the marketplace. If you do badly, and you don't serve the consumer, you go bankrupt. But when you prop-up policies that are bad, ultimately the consumer is hurt by these regulations because the market doesn't hold them in check, and I see that as a bigger problem. The question is, though, do you think that with additional regulations, more rules and--it might not hurt the consumer in the sense that it is going to be difficult to come up with a new package for the consumer. People might just say, ``To heck with gift cards and other things; I am not going to mess with this.'' And then there is a cost; there is a cost always, and it is always borne by the consumer. Any time you have a regulation, you say, I am going to regulate the businessman, that is a fallacy. All regulations are a tax, and they are a tax that is passed on to consumers. Could you address that, on how you can regulate without putting a tax on the consumer?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think all consumer regulation--and I frankly do think there needs to be some, that it needs to be informed by a deep understanding--an understanding of the market, an understanding of financial institutions, an understanding of the way financial markets operate and the way transactions operate--in order to avoid adding excessive costs; and that such regulations have to be done with an eye toward the availability of financial services. So it is a balance between the quality and the quantity of financial services.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","Right now, there is a big grass-roots effort by consumers, who are saying that the Congress has not fulfilled its responsibility in knowing exactly what the Federal Reserve does--what kind of agreements they make with international banks, other governments, international financial organizations, what kinds of conversations they have had with companies like Goldman Sachs. And because of this consumer concern, they have asked for more oversight of the Federal Reserve, and there are now 277 Members of Congress who think that should be the case. Why do you think it would hurt consumers for us to know more about what the Federal Reserve is doing, which may well be hurting the consumer if we knew more about it? How can this information be harmful?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Congressman, we are making quite a bit of information available now. We have a weekly report of our balance sheet. We have a monthly report which is submitted to Congress. We have a great deal of information on our Web site. And we also are subject to quite a bit of GAO oversight. The one place, the one exception to that oversight, is in monetary policy; and what research has shown with monetary policy is that the independence of monetary policy is important for expectations of--","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","May I interrupt, because this bill would have nothing to do with monetary policy. They might find out what has been done, but it wouldn't interfere at all with monetary policy. And I would beg to disagree. There is more than one issue. It is not monetary policy. If you look at the code, it exempts about five categories; one is, all relationships and transactions with foreign governments, foreign central banks, international financial institutions, private corporations. So those are exempt, too, and I think those are pretty important. In a way, if the Federal Reserve can have an agreement with another government, that is like a treaty. And surely it isn't exactly what the founders intended when they wrote the Constitution. I see my time has expired.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the witness, Ms. Duke, for appearing today. It is an honor to have you with us, Ms. Duke. My concern has to do with what I called to your attention earlier about being proactive as opposed to reactive. And while I appreciate much of what was done in December of last year, it appeared to be reactive, and I am interested in how do you move from that level of engagement, such that you start to look for ways to protect the consumer, which is what I think most people assume that a consumer protection agency would do. Let me just give you an example. My suspicion is that a consumer protection agency would have, or a consumer protector would have, looked at the yield spread premium, an undisclosed yield spread premium, and probably have concluded that there is something wrong this as it relates to the consumer, the one who actually received it. And I said ``undisclosed,'' wherein you qualify the buyer for 5 percent, and you don't tell the buyer that you qualified for 5 percent; and you give them a loan for 8 or 10 percent, and he or she never knows that he or she qualified for prime and was pushed into the subprime market. How would you do this? How would you become proactive on an issue like this?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I appreciate that question. We have actually talked about this quite a bit and have recognized the need to be proactive, and I think, at least in recent years, have become quite proactive. The regulations that I appreciate you mentioning, the regulations governing both mortgages and credit cards that we recently passed are one example of that. A second example that you may not be as much aware of is the review of disclosures that we have done, the review of disclosures under truth in lending, and we have finalized new disclosure rules for credit cards. We will this week be unveiling new disclosures for mortgage loans, as well as home equity, which will address exactly the yield spread premium that you are talking about. As part of doing that, we have instituted consumer testing, and we have spent quite a bit of time testing disclosures with consumers to make sure we understand how they make decisions and what information is meaningful to them. And what we are finding is that, in some cases, there are some practices that you just plain can't explain with a disclosure, no matter how hard you try, and those are the practices we elect to prohibit.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","It seems to me--and I appreciate what you are doing. It seems to me that if we have this located in the Fed, the consumer protection agency, that you have a balance that you have to achieve and that is safety and soundness. You obviously always want to have that in mind and then you want to protect the consumer. I don't think that either agency should lean one way or the other, assuming that this consumer protection agency is separate and apart from the Fed. I think it should be concerned about safety and soundness as well. But your perch tends to dictate what your view is. You can go to Mount Rushmore, and if you are standing on the wrong side, you won't see all of these pictures, these carvings of Presidents. And if you are a consumer protection agent, it just seems to me that you would be more focused on the recipient and how the consumer will benefit than you will--than a person who is in banking and is concerned about the product. I think that concern about the product is what actually caused us to have problems with protecting the consumer. So how do you reconcile this, if you have it?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I understand what you are saying. And, frankly, a lot of these discussions talk about prudential supervision and the good of the institutions versus the consumers, if they are two different things. And that might have been a reasonable perception a couple of years ago. Given what we have come through recently, I don't think anybody can argue that what is important, as far as consumers understanding the products they are buying, is absolutely important also for the workings of our economy in addition to the financial institutions; and that what is good for one is good for the others, and that each of those perspectives gives you another window into ferreting potential problems.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","My concern is that the enlightenment came after a certain degree of friction, if you will. And I think that a consumer protector being proactive would have picked up on some of these things a little bit sooner because that is the job of the consumer protector. And my time is up, so I will have to yield back and wait for a second round. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Governor Duke, you noted in your written testimony, ``We believe that replicating in another agency the deep expertise and full array of functions embedded within the Federal Reserve and used to support our consumer protection program would be enormously challenging.'' Can you elaborate on that? What challenges do you think we would face in setting up a brand-new agency?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Our Consumer Affairs Division draws frequently and deeply on the researcher, the economic researchers that we have. We do regular studies of 3-year--every 3 years a study of consumer finances. We have numerous studies going--on markets for consumer credit, on debt markets. We are closely entwined with the securitization markets and, in addition, all of the supervision people that we have. So having all of that, those resources which are core competencies of the Federal Reserve, for the consumer protection group to draw on is something that I think informs their policymaking in a very positive way.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","And that new agency wouldn't have that expertise or that resource?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I believe that the proposal calls for the new agency to have research capability. But whether it would replicate the entire research capability of the Federal Reserve, I wouldn't think so.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","All right. You testified--and I think the chairman actually mentioned this--that the Federal Reserve views consumer protection as ``complementary to, rather than in conflict with, other responsibilities at the Federal Reserve, such as prudential supervision and fostering financial stability.'' And, of course, those are both very important to consumers also. And you say these missions reinforce each other, which--I think that is absolutely true. What are the dangers of setting up another agency that may view consumer protection as a conflicting mandate with prudential supervision or safety and soundness, rather than a complementary one as the Fed does?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think probably those risks would have to do with inadvertently adding costs to consumer products through less familiarity, say, with the payment systems and the way those work, or the way the markets work, the way financial institutions are structured, and so mandating protections that are simply more expensive to comply with, or in some cases, that might cause financial institution providers not to offer the product and reduce availability.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Let me say this: I think you suggested two, I think, beneficial changes. I think this Congress, particularly if we leave consumer protection at the Fed and that codifies consumer protection as a core mission, I think that would be important. And another thing you say is, ``establish periodic reporting requirements for consumer protection similar to the Federal Reserve's semiannual monetary policy report.'' Of course, you do it twice a year, your Chairman comes before the Congress to talk about monetary policy. That is very helpful. And I think it would be invaluable in us overseeing--and you actually, the Federal Reserve, discharging its duties in consumer protection--to have a similar hearing once a year, or semiannually, to have a progress report on consumer protection and answer questions from the members because markets change, as you said in your statement or in the statement on the Fed's role in consumer protection. Markets change and products evolve. I think that would be an important reform that the Congress could make. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver, is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Governor Duke, thank you for being here. I represent the Fifth District of Missouri, primarily Kansas City, Missouri, and of course, we have a regional Federal Reserve office. It is a cute building, too, incidentally. It is a brand-new building. Have you seen it yet?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes, I have.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Don't you think it is cute? Thank you for--","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I have never discussed that subject, if a building is cute, but--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","It is. The thing that strikes me about the regional office in Kansas City is that it is the center for all of the national complaints. The complaints that would occur in New Jersey end up being routed to the call center in our Federal Reserve office; and they report that there is about one complaint per bank per year, one complaint per bank per year, which would suggest, I think, that--that is a pretty good average. I mean, that is unbelievable. Churches get more complaints than that on a Sunday. So I think that is pretty good. And while I do agree that Sarbanes-Oxley didn't live up to what it was intended or certainly by those who promoted it, that the truth of the matter is, I think one of our problems is that we don't have an opportunity for people to understand what is going on. I don't know--have you ever seen ``Jaywalking?''","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Isn't it amazing, people can't tell you who the Vice President of the United States is? So how would they know, the people on the street, even know what the Federal Reserve is? You start asking questions--I bet if they asked questions on the street, most people wouldn't have any idea what the Federal Reserve is. So most people I would think, and maybe you would agree, if they had a complaint against a bank, they wouldn't know where to take it. Would you agree?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Now, stay with me.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am with you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Burger King--I used to be on the board; our goal was to always have free-standing Burger Kings as opposed to having them in buildings because our research showed that we did infinitely more business if we had free-standing Burger King stores. Are you still with me?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am still with you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Do you agree then that if we had a free- standing agency to handle consumer complaints that we might get more than one a year?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes. I think if you consolidate the complaints and do a good job of publishing and publicizing the place to go with those complaints, you will get more complaints.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman--I am going to give him a law license, I think, after the end of this hearing. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","I have a law license. I made sure they shredded it. I disclaim it. Whenever I have a member of the Board of Governors here, and I don't think I have had a chance to examine you yet, I ask about just your personal legal interpretation of section 133. You will remember this is the code section that says that that in times of emergency and after proper consultation, the Fed can basically extend credit so long as it is secured. And your Chairman has taken the position, what does that security mean? To him, it means the equivalent of AAA. Do you agree with that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes, sir, and you have asked me that question before.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","As the chairman of the full committee says, duplication is often a very good thing. I am concerned about form shopping, not just on prudential regulation, but consumer regulation. If we bring together all of the consumer regulation, then it doesn't matter whether you are subject to Fed regulation or not. You are going to have the same consumer regulation. Do you think it makes sense to have the Fed provide borrower protection to those who borrow from, say, banks but then have a different consumer regulator define what it takes to protect consumers if they are borrowing from a nonbank?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think there are two pieces to that. One is the rules which should, and in most cases do, cover all lenders who are offering the same product. The other piece, and the really important piece here, is the supervision--the level of supervision and enforcement, which has been uneven, and I think that is one of--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","Are you saying that the Fed has the power to turn to some guy in my District who offers a friend a mortgage, that you have regulatory power over the terms of that mortgage?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","We have power over the terms of the mortgage. We don't have the authority or the mandate to go in and examine whether or not the guy actually complied with the regulations.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","So Fed regulations apply even to the most private loans. If I loan money to my brother-in-law, I had better check Federal regulations?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am not a lawyer, and I cannot tell you that. But they do apply to lenders generally--commercial lenders, bank and nonbank.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","Bank and nonbank. Now there are those who say there would be a conflict if you had the safety and soundness regulator and the consumer protection regulator separated. And yet lenders today have to deal with IRS rules and they have to deal with environmental rules, they have to deal with State consumer regulation, they have to deal with prudential regulation, they have to deal with the FDIC. Somehow we work it all out. Do you see it as somehow impossible for the prudential regulators to work--to avoid conflicts with the consumer regulator?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I do not. And as a matter of fact, we do work it out with other regulators all the time.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","I would like to return to the governance issues I brought up in my opening statement. How much power do the members of the regional Board of Governors have in dealing with consumer protection in prudential regulation?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Very little. The regional boards are focused primarily on economic matters and the operation of the Reserve Banks themselves and not on supervision or consumer protection.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","Can you identify any harm there would be if we had, as Presidential appointees, all the members of the Board of Governors of all of the regional banks?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think that the system that we have with the separate Reserve Banks who are--who have separate boards of directors are important for our independence and monetary policy, that they perform a critical role in monetary policy.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","So you think it is critical that monetary policy be determined in large part by those voted on by bankers, rather than reflect the outcome of elections?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","It is not exactly that directly. And the number of votes on the Open Market Committee--there are seven for the governors and five voting members from the Reserve Banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","That is still an important number, 5 out of 12. And it is not like the meatball industry gets representation; it is not like the lawyers, the accountants or the shoemakers get representation. They are all affected by the Federal Open Market Committee as well. And why bankers would have such tremendous power over government, over the most famous of all Federal Government decisions. There is nothing the Federal Government does that is watched more intently than the Federal Open Market Committee.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Actually, two-thirds of the boards of each of the Reserve Banks are made up of members of industry, not from--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","So if you had--the industry dominates the regional; the regional has five-twelfths of the Open Market Committee, and that is not democracy.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Not the banking industry, but from manufacturing, commerce, retail, labor, consumer.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. I announced earlier that we may go a second round if the gentleman is prepared to stay for that. Mr. Ellison is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I also thank you, Governor Duke. It is good it see you again. I appreciate the time you have taken to help us understand the issues today and yesterday. It is a pleasure to see you here. In your view, is consumer protection from the view of the Fed an equal partner to potential regulation?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","It is today.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","How do you feel that we got to the point we are at now over the course of the last 8 years? Do you think it has been historically?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think when you look back, we absolutely could have and should have taken action earlier than we did. It is hard for me to determine why not. But what I can tell you is that in the time that I have been there, and actually when I arrived there, there is quite a bit of focus on both supervision and consumer protection.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Do other central banks around the world have consumer protection within their portfolio?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","It is not a typical central bank function. Although I would point out that after 40 years, we have quite a bit of institutional experience and knowledge and memory and that, as an overall matter, our consumer structure and availability in the United States is the envy of the world.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Yes. Thanks for talking about the Consumer Advisory Council in your testimony. I know they play an important role in advising the Board on consumer regulatory matters. But as I was looking at the membership of the committee, it sort of looked to me like there are a lot of people from the banking industry on the Consumer Advisory Council. Has that ever come to your attention?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","That is actually required by statute.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","I see. Now is there a similar board that advises the Fed on banking issues?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There is also within the statute the Federal Advisory Commission which is made up entirely of the banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Are consumer advocates on that board?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","They are not.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","The bankers have their own board and part of another one. That is a good deal.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Again, it is statutory.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","And I think it is important to point out that Congress had its own role to play in all of this. I think that is what it means when it is statutory.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Excuse me. If I could, though, we do meet quite regularly with numerous consumer groups as well as industry groups in our boardroom with the entire Board.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Right. As I went through here, I looked for people who were bankers. There are some nonprofits. But if you look on--just from my look at what was printed on the Board's Web site the Consumer Advisory Council, it is at last half representation by the banking industry or credit score agency or real estate. That is not a critique of you, Governor, it is just an observation. And I think it is something we need to look at when we talk about issues of governances. Issues around this have already been raised. Let me kind of paint a scenario for you. Let's just say that banks are reaping a lot of their profits from, say, overdraft fees, and we have a safety and soundness regulator who says, great, you are making money, you have an income stream. And then you have a consumer regulator who says, that is a problem, this person had a 35-cent overdraft and has a $35 fee. Now under the present system, that problem will be resolved. Somebody will, someone will make a decision and say the prudential matters are of greater importance than the consumer. Or it could happen the other way, although I doubt it. Isn't that true? Somebody right now is resolving these conflicts that could arise between the prudential regulation and consumer regulation. That is happening now; isn't that right?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Well, if I could come back to, in particular, overdrafts. What we have found, again, particularly in the most recent crisis, the important thing--we talk a lot about the conflict, but there is also the benefit of having the consumer regulation inform safety and soundness and say this may be a short-term source of profitability, but it may not be a reliable long-term source of profitability, and to sound a warning on the prudential side that products that are not well understood and not used well by consumers can actually, as we have seen, come back and endanger the very institution itself.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","And we could have joint examination even if the function were separated.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Conceivably.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","I guess my main point is that there has been some dialogue around the conflict, not raised by you but by members of our committee, and they seem to say there is a conflict and the bill doesn't clearly spell out what to do in the case of a conflict. But my point is, there already is a potential for a conflict and probably already have had those kind of conflicts resolved. But now there is just collapse within one entity, and the public really never knows how these things are resolved; is that right?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There are possible conflicts. Although I think the complementarities are stronger even than the conflicts.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","And would you agree that you could have complementarity even from agencies that are not under the same roof?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Yes, I would.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","I think that means I am done.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. We are at this juncture. I don't want to be unfair to the second panel, but I think there is some benefit to be gained by going at least some more with this witness. I have a few more questions. So I am thinking that maybe if we did a second round of 3 minutes each, and if somebody really needed more than that, we can do it by unanimous consent. Would that be satisfactory to everybody? In that case, I recognize myself for 3 minutes. And I start by acknowledging the testimony that you gave about the expertise that is on your staff at the Fed and let you know that Ms. Braunstein, who is sitting behind you, is one of my favorite people. So I recognize that there is substantial expertise at the Fed in the consumer and consumer outreach area, and I respect that. The question I have is, though, I presume that expertise, whether it is Ms. Braunstein or members of her staff or others, could be transferred to a separate agency if they were not doing consumer protection inside the Fed; and perhaps do that with reference to all of the consumer regulation in this area as opposed to just for the Fed. Am I missing something here?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am not sure--first of all, I thank you for recognizing Ms. Braunstein and her staff, because they are outstanding.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I wouldn't think of doing otherwise.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","They are outstanding public servants and they bring not only knowledge and experience to the job, but a passion for consumer protection.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","You have a reasonably good legislative affairs guy there too. I didn't want him to feel like he was being left out.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I will use your time to praise all of our staff. But I think that one of the things to consider would be that in the rule-writing area in particular, that as good as they are, they might find it more difficult to write their rules without the support of the research staff, the market staff and the supervision staff.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","All right. Let me go to the real question, because I noticed the real complaint from the panel we had here from the industry yesterday was that there was this big conflict or potential for conflict if we created this agency. And I dealt with the part of the conflicts between consumer and consumer. I recognize that possibility exists. I notice you didn't say anything in your testimony about the potential conflict that they kept talking to me about, that nobody was able to identify for me, the conflict that they have said exists between your prudential regulation and the consumer part. There is nothing in your testimony that I could identify. Is there such a conflict between the consumer side of your operation and the regulatory or monetary policy side of your operation?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There is probably--","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Maybe just give me one example. I asked a witness this morning, on the panel that we had this morning, to give me one example of a potential conflict between consumer protection and regulation, and he wasn't able to do it. I am just having trouble figuring out what that conflict is.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There are probably conflicts in a number of different senses. I am trying to sort through them pretty quickly in my mind. There is a potential for conflict between agencies. Any time you have agencies--","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I understand that. I am talking about policy conflicts. I am talking about policy conflicts between a consumer representative, whether it is in your agency or outside your agency, and the responsibilities you have as regulator of banks and/or monitor policy.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","There are a couple of different pieces. There is probably a perceived conflict between, for instance--","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I am talking about real conflict.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Well, a conflict in perception between a consumer protection proposal that might have the potential to increase cost or reduce availability. So you might have that weighing of those two considerations.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","All right, okay. Let me go one step further. Suppose we just assumed that there is that conflict, and the consumer side of your operation says, this is a real problem for consumers; and the regulatory side of your operation says, this is a real problem for regulators. How does that get resolved? Who has the final word on that now? Is it the consumer's interest that is being driven or is it the bank's interest that is being driven?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","From the standpoint of within an agency or even between agencies, it is a policy balance and ultimately that is what a policymaker has to do, has to make the call balancing those two interests. From an industry standpoint, if I could reach back into my industry days, I think what that might mean is if you have one set of regulators telling you one thing and another set of regulators telling you something else, the question of which one do you pay the most attention to, which possibly gives rise in a difference in intensity from one or the other.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","All right, my time has run out, unfortunately, and I am well over the 3 minutes that I said I was going to try to hold people to. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 3 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to follow up on my question about whether or not current Federal Reserve policy is fair to the consumer. I argue there is a real challenge to the consumer in two points. One, the consumer is always losing purchasing power, and only the Federal Reserve can undo the purchasing power of a dollar. And also the low interest rates which are artificial, because the Fed is involved in interest rates and it really hurts the innocent consumer. As a matter of fact, the people who are more frugal, the people who borrow against mortgages, they don't care that much. But the frugal people who are doing what a lot of people think they should do, they get penalized. And I know the answer so often that comes back is--I always get the quotes back of what the CPI is doing, and there is really no inflation so don't worry about it. Inflation is a monetary issue and we just doubled the money supply in a short period of time. And I would also argue that prices are going up significantly in certain areas. One thing characteristic about inflation, all prices don't go up uniformly. If they did and wages went up uniformly, inflation would be no problem. But we have educational costs, they go up disproportionately. Just think about how military equipment goes up and how the military industrial complex gets served with this system. And then also the people who participate in the financial bubbles, and if they are able to get out they benefit tremendously. But also today in medicine, today we are facing this medicine crisis. Not that the care isn't there. We can get good care, but it costs too much. That is an inflationary problem as much as anything else, because those places where government gets involved, like these three things I mentioned, that is where the money goes and that is where the prices get pushed up. You don't get better service, because you don't get better education or medical care, you get higher prices. So what is your defense of this position that the Fed isn't a very good protector of the consumer because it undermines the value of a dollar? We have lost 96 percent of the value of our dollar since the Fed has been in existence, and also this low interest rate issue that I bring up.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","We are conducting monetary policy to achieve our dual mandate, which is low inflation and steady prices and economic growth. And the inflation rate right now, the core consumer inflation is about 1.8 percent.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","According to government statistics, but not according to the consumers. Private sources say that the consumer price index is much higher than what the government reports. So it is in the interest of the government and the Federal Reserve to say that there is no erosion. But whether or not it is today or next year, we know the history. But what justification is it? Doesn't this seem to be unfair? If you had a CD in the bank, or your parents had a CD in the bank and they were making 1 percent instead of 5 percent, is that fair or unfair?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","The interest rates are set and are managed, again, to meet our mandate. And right now rates are particularly low in order to support economic activity, particularly funds' availability to borrowers.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","I think the consumer loses on that deal. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 3 minutes. I am recognizing him for 3 minutes because we are on the second round of questions with an understanding that if people need more than 3 minutes, they can get it by unanimous consent. The gentleman from New York.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Ms. Duke. Let me ask you, we had a panel here earlier before the full committee, and what I was trying to figure out and what a number of individuals are talking about is the fact that some are questioning whether the systemic risk regulator should be the Fed. The Fed has been--they have talked about giving the Fed a lot more jurisdiction, a lot more responsibility. And some are concerned about--and I think that based upon the White Paper that the President has put out, that there is going to be tremendous responsibility that is going to cause a lot more work. Now we want to make sure, because we are looking forward to put some legislation that we think is going to take place and survive for 70, 80, 100 years. What is wrong with letting the Fed focus as a systemic risk regulator and doing what it has to do in maintaining this whole spectrum of responsibilities, and then having another agency whose primary focus is on consumer protection? It seems to me to make sense so that we are not overburdening the Fed. What is wrong with that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","If the question is the overburdening of the Fed, the first thing I would say about the systemic risk responsibility that is in the proposal from the Administration is actually not an incrementally large increase in the activities we have today. The systemically important institutions, the vast majority of them were not necessarily bank holding companies last Fall, but through the crisis became bank holding companies. And I am not aware of very many institutions that would be considered systemically important that we don't supervise today. I think the difference would be probably in the focus of that supervision which would look not just to the individual institutions themselves, but also to the impact of their activities across the financial system.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Meeks","But the problem is that it seems no one picked up. We are in this crisis now. There is enough blame to go around. I am not blaming just the Fed. And no one seemed to pick up the problems that we were having, and the Fed is the one that is supposed to be the independent authority on monetary policy; now we get the systemic risk on top of that. Then what concerns many individuals is the fact that the Fed had authority, for example, to issue rules implementing the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act beginning in 1994, yet it chose not to do anything or issue any rules until 2008, which would be important to the consumer. Why is that? Can you explain that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Again, in hindsight, we could have and should have acted faster on that. Since that time, however, the Fed has been very proactive in the areas of regulations governing mortgages and credit cards, in consumer testing and issuing new consumer disclosures which would be much more helpful to consumers, and also in community outreach for foreclosure prevention and neighborhood stabilization. I would say since learning that lesson, the Fed has been extremely proactive.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Meeks","I see my time has expired.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Thank you. And I am squeezing people a little bit, because we do have to be out of the room by 4:30 and we have another panel. So be cognizant of that. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for 3 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Governor Duke, as I think someone else said, the Fed has had the right to regulate unfair and deceptive loans since, I guess, 1994. Is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think so.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Now it really took until 2007 or 2008 for them to do that; is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","2008.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","2008? I think maybe if we had had something where you came up every year and explained your progress. On occasions members did write and say, what are you doing? Let me ask you this. Even on the lending underwriting standards, I think at the same time or around that same period of time, you were given the jurisdiction on all loan underwriting standards; is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I believe, and I am not certain on this, so if I get too deep into it, I may have to respond in writing. But I believe that we issued guidance to those institutions that we supervised on underwriting, but then afterwards when we came out with regulations, those regulations would have governed both bank and nonbank lenders.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","You know, there was no going into the banks and examining anything. But I know the State charter banks were examined for underwriting standards. One thing I ran into when I was advocating for subprime lending legislation in 2005, I would talk to some of the banks, the big banks, bank holding companies, and they would say, we don't do these subprime loans. And I found out later that was somewhat half true in that they all had nonbank affiliates who were making those loans hand over fist. But I don't think that the Fed did any audits or supervision of those nonbank affiliates, did they?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I think the authority to do that kind of examination was a little unclear under Gramm-Leach-Bliley. However, we did conduct a pilot program within the last year where we went into nonbank subsidiaries jointly with the FTC, with the OTS, with State regulators, and did full compliance exams on those. And as a result of what we learned there, we are going to continue those examinations.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Will you enforce the hope of regulations as well?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","We will enforce all consumer regulations.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Will that be just on subprime loans or--","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","It will be on every kind of loan.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from California is recognized for 3 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","I want to return to the issue of governance at the regional board level. Who has the power to select those members at the regional level, not selected by the President? When I say this, I mean even if bankers are doing the selecting, but have to select a former union leader, that person is a bank selectee. You can always find a former union leader that will reflect the interest of those appointing. How are these slots filled? Who has the power to fill them?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I assume you are talking about the Reserve Bank presidents?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","And their boards, yes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","Let me back up. The boards of directors of the Reserve banks, there are nine members of the board of directors, A, B, and C directors. The A directors generally are officers or directors of banks and they are elected by the member banks.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","Okay.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","The B directors generally come from and there is a list of 6, and I am not sure I can name them all. It is commerce, manufacturing, labor, retail, agriculture--and I am missing one.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","All right.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","And those are elected by the banks. But that is where they come from, and they are not permitted to be affiliated with a bank.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","But you are free to find the retailer who is most bank-friendly and appoint that person, elect that person?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","In theory. But in practice, that is not the case. And I can actually send a breakdown of what they are. And the C directors are appointed by the Board of Governors, and again from that same group.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sherman","You have two-thirds selected by the banks. They can't select bankers, but there are literally millions of people that they can turn to, and they just have to find a business person or whatever who meets their interest. Trust me, if only bald people got to vote, but we had to vote for people with hair, there would be no taxes on bald people. We would find some--some would go get the Bosley thing and sneak in. But that is a little off point. Now, our friend Mr. Paul has a bill to audit the Federal Reserve. Obviously I don't think there is anything in that bill that says that an audit means you have a stenographer at the Open Markets Committee, and that is immediately published. What is the problem with auditing such a powerful government agency the way other government agencies are audited?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","As I understand it, GAO does audit many parts of the Federal Reserve, and that there are 20-some audits underway right now. They have been specifically asked to audit the 13(3) facilities and to audit the specific loans to individual institutions. The concern with having them audit the open market, the FLMC operations, has to do with--as I understand the way those audits go, it is a review of policy decisions, and it would be some perception of a reduction in the independence with respect to policy.","Speech"," "

"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, I was so impressed with the questioning of the gentleman next to me, I would like to ask the Chair for some guidance. Do I refer to him henceforth as Reverend, or Doctor, or Attorney, or Reverend Doctor Attorney?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I think the latter would be appropriate.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Attorney Doctor. But I do appreciate his questions and I would like to do a quick follow-up. I thought it was a fantastic point that you make. Quick follow-up, with reference to the complaints that you receive, how many complaints have actually gone from complaint to a case that was referred to the Justice Department with reference to your mission to deal with patterns on practices of discrimination?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","In terms of numbers of complaints received or otherwise, I would have to get back to you in writing on that. I do know that we investigate every complaint that we receive on our member banks that we actually supervise. And with respect to referrals to the Justice Department, they primarily come from reviews of fair lending in the institutions. And to the extent that we find discrimination, we do refer those to the Department of Justice.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Have you had occasion to have any bank, as a result of the Justice Department's action, respond and take corrective action?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I believe so. But if I could follow up in writing with specifics.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Okay. The reason I am asking is because every survey indicates that African Americans, minorities who apply for loans, are less likely to get the same treatment as equally qualified persons who are not minorities. And I am concerned that, given the history of this, and the lack of what I see as affirmative action to correct it, what will happen if we leave it there? It seems to me that a consumer protection agency would probably look at these things a little bit closer and see it as a greater mission than it has been accorded where it is currently.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I would just say that our examiners take this very seriously. And there really are two parts to the examination process. Sometimes they may find a practice that is not in itself discrimination but looks suspect or looks dangerous, and they will talk with the bank and maybe take informal action to get that practice stopped. In those cases, the practice does stop. In cases where either that is not an option or the practice does not stop, those cases are referred to Justice.","Speech"," "

"Mr. Ellison","Thank you again for your patience, Governor. You have been great this afternoon. You know, I read an article which says that banks and credit unions collect about $17.5 billion, with a ``B'' in overdraft fees per year. How does this overdraft issue play in terms of the safety and soundness of banks? Is it, I guess, a good thing from their perspective, because it is a stream of income; or does it indicate something we should be concerned about?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","It is a stream of income. However, there are also some issues with overdraft protection or with overdraft fees. We have actually already published, for comment, rules governing overdrafts. Those rules have both an opt-in and an opt-out alternative, and we are now testing disclosures of those alternatives. And we will issue some final rules this year. And so to the extent that banks are overly reliant on overdraft income, that would in the short term. That would be a risk in the long term.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","I am speaking only from a prudential regulator standpoint. What sort of things might a regulator who might go to a particular individual bank, who sees that a significant portion of their profitability based on these overdraft fees-- what does that conversation kind of go like, if you understand what I am saying? Is it like you are relying on us too much or you need to develop other products? Because I would imagine a safety and soundness conversation going like this: You have to have more capital, you have to develop more ways to have income streams. And so I was curious to know, how does the regulator approach the bank if they are excessively relying on overdraft fees?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","I am not quite sure with respect to the overdraft fees. But if I could, let me go to a different example. And that would be: Suppose you had an institution that was generating very strong fees from the origination and sale of subprime mortgages. Then certainly the fact it has the income stream is one possibility. But one risk is that if something should go wrong in that marketplace, that that revenue source will dry up. So I think from the prudential side, you would look for--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","In your example, the prudential issues are clear because it represents the possibility of default, right? But not with overdraft fees. This is a just a stream of income. They are not going to default by having too many overdraft fees. But it is just them getting money from a consumer, that I think most people, if you bring specific examples forward, would say the consumer is getting taken advantage of here. And yet the only person whom I think is really going to raise a stink is someone who has a view of the consumer in mind. So I am just curious to know--I guess we have been beating this horse pretty thoroughly--but I am still curious to know. I think that these two points of view are somewhat in conflict. I think that is a good thing.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Duke","To your point, though, it was the Consumer Affairs Division that actually has initiated and completed the rulemaking proposal on overdrafts this year.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thirty seconds? I just want to say for anyone who is interested in getting comments to the Fed about this overdraft issue, they have to get their comments there by July 18th. So, if anybody is interested.","Speech"," "

We thank you so much, Governor Duke, for being with us this afternoon. And we thank your trusted people, whom we have praised behind you, for being with us.

Our second witness on this panel is Ms. Lauren Saunders, managing attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. And our third witness on this panel is Mr. Jim Carr, the chief operating officer at the National Community Reinvestment Coalition. We had a fourth witness, but he turned out to be on the earlier panel, at a hearing earlier today, and I think he had heard enough from me for one day, so he decided he wouldn't come for this one. Each of you will be recognized for 5 minutes. Your full written statements and any supporting materials, of course, will be made a part of the record.

"Ms. McCoy","Chairman Watt, Ranking Member Paul, and members of the subcommittee, thank you for inviting me here today to discuss restructuring financial regulation. Today I will testify in support of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency Act of 2009. This bill would transfer consumer protection and financial services from Federal banking regulators to one agency dedicated to consumer protection. We need this to fix two problems: first, during the housing bubble, fragmented regulation encouraged lenders to shop for the easiest regulators and laws; and second, banking regulators often dismiss consumer protection in favor of the short-term profitability of banks. Under our fragmented system of credit regulation, lenders could and did shop for the easiest laws and regulators. One set of laws applies to federally chartered banks and thrifts and their operating subsidiaries. Another set of laws applies to independent nonbank lenders and mortgage brokers. Because lenders could threaten to change charters, they were able to play regulators off one another. This put pressure on regulators, both State and Federal, to relax their standards and enforcement. Countrywide, for example, turned in its charters in early 2007 in order to drop the OCC and Federal Reserve regulators and to switch to the OTS. The result was a regulatory race to the bottom that only the Fed had the power to stop. During the housing bubble, three of the four Federal banking regulators--the Federal Reserve, the OCC, and the OTS-- succumbed to pressure to loosen loan underwriting standards and safeguards for consumers. Today I will focus on the Fed. Under Chairman Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board failed to stop the mortgage crisis in thee crucial ways: First, the Federal Reserve was the only agency that could have stopped the race to the bottom. That was because it had the ability to prohibit unfair and deceptive lending for all lenders nationwide under the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. But Chairman Greenspan refused to exercise that authority. The Fed did not change its mind until last summer when it finally issued such a rule. At that point, the horse was out of the barn. Second, the Fed as a matter of policy did not do regular examinations of the nonbank subprime lenders under its jurisdiction. These included the biggest subprime lender in 2006, HSBC Finance, and Countrywide ranked number three. Finally, the last time the Fed did a major overhaul of its Truth in Lending Act mortgage disclosures was 28 years ago, in 1981. With the rise in subprime loans and nontraditional ARMs, those disclosures became solely obsolete. Nevertheless, the Fed did not even open a full review of its mortgage disclosure rules until 2007, and it still has not completed that review. So why did the Federal Reserve drop the ball? One reason was its overriding belief in deregulation. Another, however, was an attitude that a good way to improve bank safety and soundness was to bolster fee income at banks. We still see that today with respect to rate hikes with credit cards still going on. This focus on short-term profits not only hurt consumers, it undermined our Nation's financial system. The Act would fix these problems in three ways: first, it would stop shopping by providing one set of consumer protection rules for all providers nationwide; second, the Act puts the authority for administering those standards in one Federal agency whose sole mission is consumer protection. We are asking the Fed to do too much when we ask it to excel at four things: monetary policy; systemic risk regulation; bank safety and soundness; and consumer protection. Housing consumer protection in a separate agency in fact will provide a healthy check on the tendency of Federal banking regulators to underestimate risk at the top of the business cycle. Finally, to avoid any risk of future inaction by the new agency, the Act gives backup enforcement authority to the Fed and other Federal banking regulators in the States. My time is up. Thank you and I will welcome any questions.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Thank you so much. Ms. Saunders, you are recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","Thank you, Chairman Watt, Ranking Member Paul, and members of the subcommittee. Thank you for the opportunity to testify today on behalf of Americans for Financial Reform and many of its individual organizational members. We believe that better consumer protection demands more than modest changes to the existing structure. The structure itself is the problem. I am Lauren Saunders with the National Consumer Law Center. We at the National Consumer Law Center have a long and deep history of working with the banking agencies. We publish an 18- volume set of consumer law treatises, write hundreds of pages of comments every year on proposed regulations, and have participated on the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council and have otherwise interacted regularly with the banking agencies for decades. We have found the Fed staff and the Governors to be intelligent, knowledgeable, and respectful of our views. One of the strengths of the proposal to create the new agency is that it will consolidate entire divisions and will retain their experience and knowledge. There have been successes over the years, but as Congressman Green pointed out, they have tended more to be reactive than proactive measures. At the end of the day, in example after example described in my written testimony, at the Fed and the other agencies, consumers have usually come up short, trumped by an excessive faith in the free market, an overreliance on more disclosures, and an antipathy to taking measures opposed by industry. This is ironic because listening seriously to consumer concerns can help bolster safety and soundness. It was consumer advocates who pointed out that credit card debt was wreaking havoc on family finances and was unsustainable. It was the consumer advocates, not the banking agencies, who complained repeatedly about mortgages that people could not afford to pay, again and again, year in and year out, and nobody was listening. It is just one of many similar warnings. In 2003, a New York attorney, Ruhi Maker, vented her frustration at the Fed's Consumer Advisory Council: ``Consumer advocates are from Mars and bankers are from Venus. I sometimes feel that way. There are parts of the country where I really feel it is going to be a nightmare.'' This was in 2003. ``I think the horse is out the barn door and, you know, I hope I am wrong, I really hope I am wrong, but I think it's in the interest of the financial institutions to figure out how to fix this problem which some unregulated institutions created, but which then the financial institutions went and purchased.'' But those concerns and many like them year in, year out went unheeded. Mars and Venus, men and women, consumers and bankers. We think about things differently. We focus on different problems. As former Federal Governor Mishkin testified last week in saying he believed the Fed should give up its role as the consumer protection regulator, ``The skills and mind-set required to operate as a consumer protection regulator are fundamentally different from those required by a systemic regulator.'' I would say the same is also true of the mind-set of a prudential regulator. Precisely because consumer protection is complementary to safety and soundness, we need a new agency that will focus on the individual, asking questions from their perspective, about whether products are fair and contribute to or harm family financial stability. It will spot problems early, before they present safety and soundness concerns for an entire portfolio or an entire institution. The balanced proposal for a consumer financial protection agency ensures that the agency will consider real safety and soundness concerns. First, and most importantly, one of the five commissioners will be a prudential regulator. That commissioner, present at the creation, will ensure that prudential concerns are integrated into the fabric of the agency's work. Second, the agency has a statutory mandate to coordinate with the banking agencies. Not every disagreement is a serious conflict, but the agency will have every reason to listen to legitimate prudential concerns like fraud, money laundering, or operational issues. Third, the proposal requires the Consumer Financial Protection Agency and banking agencies to share confidential examination materials so that each can see the concerns that have been raised from the other's perspective. Finally, Congress will be exercising oversight. With the history of the Federal Trade Commission in mind, and a prudential regulator on the board, the agency will do everything in its power to minimize conflicts. Change is always difficult. There are always reasons for tinkering and not making important structural changes. Our coalition firmly believes that we will all be better off with a system that takes consumer protection seriously, that listens fully to both Mars and Venus. Thank you for this opportunity to testify and I welcome your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF LAUREN K. SAUNDERS, MANAGING ATTORNEY, NATIONAL CONSUMER LAW CENTER, ON BEHALF OF AMERICANS FOR FINANCIAL REFORM"
"Chairman Watt","Thank you for your testimony, Ms. Saunders. Mr. Carr, you are recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","Good afternoon, Chairman Watt, Ranking Member Paul, and other distinguished members of the subcommittee. My name is James H. Carr, National Community Reinvestment Coalition. On behalf of the Coalition, I am honored to speak with you today. NCRC is an organization of more than 600 community-based associations that promote access to basic financial services across the country for working families. NCRC is also pleased to be a member of the new coalition, Americans for Financial Reform, that is working to cultivate integrity and accountability within the financial system. Members of the committee, the collapse of the U.S. financial system represents a massive failure of financial regulation that suffered from a host of problems, including regulatory system design flaws, gaps in oversight, conflicts of interest, weaknesses in enforcement, failed philosophical perspectives on the self-regulatory functioning of the markets, and inadequate resolution authority to deal with problems after they have occurred. At the request of the committee, I will devote my time today to one issue, and that is consumer protection. Safety and soundness and consumer protection are often discussed as separate issues, yet the safety and soundness of the financial system begins with and relies on the safety and soundness of the products that are extended to the public. If the extension of credit by a financial firm promotes the economic wellbeing and financial security of the consumer, the system is at reduced risk of failure. If the financial products exploit consumers, even if they are highly profitable to financial institutions, the system is in jeopardy of failure. Unfortunately, for more than a decade, financial institutions have increasingly engaged in practices intended to mislead, confuse, or otherwise limit a consumer's ability to judge the appropriateness of financial products offered in the market and make informed decisions. In fact, the proliferation of unfair and deceptive mortgage products led directly to the current foreclosue crisis and massive destruction of U.S. household wealth, which currently stands at about $13 trillion. The tricks and traps, as it has been described by Elizabeth Warren, used to trap consumers into high-cost abusive financial products, greatly complicated if not impaired the ability of a consumer to make an informed financial decision about the most appropriate product for their financial circumstances. Nowhere was this irresponsible and reckless behavior by financial institutions more prevalent than in communities of color. For more than a decade, Federal agencies, independent research institutes, and nonprofit organizations have described and discussed the multiple ways in which people of color have been exploited financially within the mortgage market. The result today, the foreclosure crisis is having its most damaging impact on communities of color in two ways: first, people of color are experiencing a disproportionate level of foreclosures; and second, they are most negatively harmed by rising unemployment. The Obama Administration recently proposed a sweeping reform of the financial system. A core element of the President's plan is the establishment of the Consumer Financial Protection Agency. House Financial Services Chairman Frank has proposed a similar agency in his legislation, H.R. 3126. A consumer protection agency is long overdue. Currently, the financial regulatory agencies compete with one another for fees paid by institutions that they are entrusted to regulate. The winning bid is the regulator that promises the least amount of consumer protection. Although competition is an essential element in a free market, oversight and enforcement of the law is not, nor should it be, available for purchase in a free market. In fact, regulation is one of the few instances in which a monopoly market will result in the most efficient and desired result. A consumer financial agency, as outlined by both the President and the Chairman, would achieve a commonsense goal, and that is to provide standard products to eliminate unnecessary confusion for consumers on routine transactions. The concept of a standard product seems to be an anathema to some observers, but it is worth remembering that a 30-year fixed rate mortgage has been for more than half a century, and remains today, the gold standard loan product. It was created to help the Nation recover from the collapse of the previous major fall of the housing and credit markets during the Great Depression. In short, sometimes a good standard is the best innovation. In order to be most effective, the new consumer financial protection agency must examine lending at a community level as well. Highly segregated communities of color are the primary targets for unfair, deceptive, and predatory lending. As a result, the agency must have the knowledge, experience, and resources to address this critical reality. Moreover, prohibiting reckless and irresponsible products is only half the challenge in making sure there is equal access to reliable financial services. Many financial firms simply deny access to financial services completely. America has a long, unfortunate history of redlining. The Act that most significantly can address that issue at a community level is the Community Reinvestment Act. That law was included in the consumer protection agency proposed by the President, and we recommend that it be included in the bill that is being considered by this House. In conclusion, there has and will continue to be considerable pushback against the idea of a consumer financial protection agency, primarily from financial institutions. Their argument is that such an agency will stifle innovation, limit access to credit, and discourage lending to families most in need. These arguments should be considered as having the same merit as the declaration that the markets are self-regulating. We have seen the folly of self-regulated markets, and the American people are paying an extraordinary price for failed consumer protection. Thank you very much. I look forward to your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF JAMES H. CARR, CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER, NATIONAL COMMUNITY REINVESTMENT COALITION (NCRC)"
"Chairman Watt","Thank you so much for all of your testimony. And we will now go to questioning by the members. It is my policy to go last on the last panel, since I have to be here anyway. So with that in mind--before I do that, though, I did want to commend to the members' attention the historical analysis that Professor McCoy has done. You would do well to read her entire testimony, not just the 5 minutes that she abbreviated here. It is about the best analysis of how we got here that I have seen floating around. So the gentleman from New York, Mr. Meeks, is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for your testimony here today. You know, my district in New York is the number one in foreclosures in the City of New York. I am noticing a certain trend, and I am wondering if you can tell me your opinion on this and whether a consumer agency would be able to intersect. Here is what I am finding: number one, that individuals who have taken out mortgages--and some of the financial institutions had skin in the game, they didn't just take it and securitize it away--that those individuals' incomes and the credit they received seemed to match more or less the mortgages that they were receiving. Those who went to mortgage brokers or some others and their incomes did not match, those were simply sold away, because they weren't going to keep them, so it didn't matter. And so there are two things that are happening. Either individuals are now in upside-down mortgages, and the banks are not refinancing them; or they just simply--if they had adjustable rates, and they adjusted, they can't afford them and they are thrown out of their homes. So what I am concerned with in your vision when we move forward with a consumer financial protection agency, that this would be an area of which they could specialize and look in to see if, in fact--or tracking, if you will--to see if in fact there is a pattern. I mean, for years we have been talking here about predatory lending. And there has been no one that I know of that we could go to, to focus on, to stop predatory lending. I can recall on this committee we could go--we would be talking time after time after time to a person, at the person, but yet no result. So in your mind's eye, would a consumer financial protection agency also be an adequate agency to look at issues such as predatory lending and put an end to it? That would be my first question.","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","It would be a very important piece of the puzzle. What we need to stop is this two-tier system where the sensible loans are the ones held in portfolio and the reckless, dangerous loans are the ones sold through securitization. Having one uniform standard for all loans, whether they are securitized or not, would definitely help that problem. But here the bank regulators would continue to have a role even if the agency is created, because the bank regulators can make sure that banks are not rewarded with lower capital requirements for securitizing bad loans. So they can partially buttress safety through capital treatment, and they should.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","I would agree with that. I would add, however, that the first step in enforcement is actually knowing there is a problem. And one of the great opportunities of this new agency is to have a staff steeped in the ability and understanding of consumer issues such that they can examine the trends and practices, and patterns and practices, to bring forth really powerful studies with a Federal imprimatur.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Meeks","Before I run out of time, refute this argument for me. Some have said that with the agency, we would need to look at a vanilla product, we would have to put 20 to 25 percent down; and as a result, I know, therefore the availability of credit, and particularly in minority communities, to own a home--which I still believe is the way we create wealth--would become smaller and thereby the gap between the haves and have-nots would become greater. How would you answer that?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","It is a frivolous argument, the idea that somehow every single consumer is different from one another. There is a difference to offering one product to every single consumer in the market as opposed to having standard products that are based on individuals' income, their wealth, and certain other types of financial circumstances to create classes of standard products. And one can be very nimble, very innovative, with standard products. In fact, there are a lot of them that actually exist. The problem was they could not compete with the reckless subprime loans that were actually priced at a much higher premium by the investment banks. So the idea that somehow you lose innovation because you introduce standards is a frivolous argument.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","I thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have a question for Mr. Carr on how optimistic he might be about what we are trying to do. I tend toward pessimism at times; and I think the problem is almost bigger than what we are dealing with here, and we are just dealing on the edge of the basic problem. So the system that we have had has been around a long time. We have had a system--some people refer to it as capitalism that was unregulated. I happen to think that it doesn't have much to do with capitalism; it has to do with corporatism, where corporations seem to get the benefits of some of the programs that are designed to help the poor. We have multiple programs that have been going on for a long time designed to help the poor, and yet sometimes I think that is so superficial. The poor seem to become more numerous and the poor--especially since the crisis has hit; but it is always on a pretense to help the poor, and yet the corporations stand to make the money. So they make the money and they have the power and they have the insight with some of our financial institutions, including the Federal Reserve; and when the bubble forms, they benefit, and nobody complains too much if it seems to satisfy a lot of people. But when the bust comes, then we have a bailout. Who does the bailout serve? Do we immediately go out and bail out the people that we tried to get houses for? No. We immediately go out and bail out the system. So--the system is so deeply flawed, so they make the money when the bubble is being formed and they get bailed out when the bubble bursts. We come along with a new system that we hope will work. But for housing programs, for instance, you know, we want houses for the poor people, but developers make a lot of money, builders make a lot of money, mortgage companies make a lot of money, the banks make a lot of money. And all of a sudden the system doesn't work very well and the poor get wiped out and they lose their houses. So if we don't address that major problem, the structure of the system, this corporatism which has invaded us, how can this idea that, well, we will regulate a little bit in order to protect the consumer--I guess I am rather cynical, and I want you to tell me whether you share any of that concern, whether my cynicism sometimes is justified or not.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","Congressman, I appreciate the question because I agree with much of what you have just said. One of the problems that we have in this country is that we have the financial system operating on one side of the ledger and we have special programs for the poor on the other. The way the poor became solid middle class in this country was by having a financial system that built their wealth and public policies working with that financial system, coming largely out of the Great Depression, that built the vast majority of our middle class. We do not have that now. Instead, we have a banking system that looks at consumers and says, how can we exploit them? And that is problematic, and until we change that system such that when a bank and our financial institution is reaching to a consumer specifically to promote the economic mobility of that consumer and build their wealth--if that is not their goal, if that is not what is going to be accomplished by their product, the poor will remain poor and all the Federal subsidies in the world won't help them. That is why it is so critical to put into place an agency that actually combines the knowledge, the collective wisdom of people who actually understand the banking system, the financial system, and understand it is their mission to promote the economic mobility of this country. Because once they are working together, there will be no conflicts of promoting wealth and stability within working families, with safety and soundness of the financial system. And then, Congressman, the other programs that you have talked about, that have failed so miserably so often, those programs will now have a foundation by which they can actually enhance what is happening. But if the markets don't work for the general public, poverty will never be resolved.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","One other quick question. Would you have any objection, personally, to us knowing what is going on at the Federal Reserve and have an audit of the Federal Reserve?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","I am not familiar with the Federal Reserve's audit.","Speech"," "
"Dr. Paul","I am finished. I yield back.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I thank the witnesses for appearing. I have a question with reference to the Fed continuing to perform the function of consumer protection. And I would like for each of you to give me a reason why the Fed should not-- this consumer protection agency should not be in the Fed. And I would like for you to discount--it is exceedingly important that you do this--discount past performance. Do not let that be your reason, discounting past performance. Why would we not want the Fed to have custody, care, and control of this agency? Ms. McCoy, we will start with you.","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","Thank you, Congressman Green. The reason why the Fed would not do as good a job as the agency is that it approaches safety and soundness issues, which is one of its core concerns, through the vantage point of banks. It is concerned about their solvency. The banks, in turn, report quarterly profits, and that tends to produce a short-term vantage that the Federal Reserve often shares. And that is true not only for the Federal Reserve. It is true for the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. And this is a structural and cultural mind- set that will not change.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Thank you. Ms. Saunders?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","I was basically going to say the same thing. I think the questioning here today has pointed out how many people coming from consumer organizations sit on the Board of Governors, have ever sat on the Board of Governors, even have had a significant role on the Consumer Advisory Council. I actually drafted a section of my testimony focused on the CAC and how it promotes industry views more than consumers'. It just pervades the agency. Whether we add the words ``consumer protection'' to the line in the statute or not, it is always going to be a small part of the overall function of the Federal Reserve, and it is so dominated by bankers and focused on banking and those concerns that it is going to look at things from that perspective and miss important questions if you look at it--focus solely on the consumer.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Mr. Carr?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","I would just reinforce the past two comments, that it is just a structure that does not and will not work. In fact, you said, without looking in hindsight or retrospectively, it is really hard to do that. You just asked a question right in the depths of the greatest recession we have had in a half century. We know that much of the damage was brought to Black and Latino communities. How many civil rights actions are currently active by the Fed? And the answer was, we are not sure. I can't look backward, but can I look back just an hour? I think we need an agency that understands that economic opportunity and economic mobility is imperative for this country; and that if you can't respond to that in the depth of this crisis, how can you be given the mantle to make sure that those rights are ensured?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Missouri is recognized for 5 minutes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It won't take the entire 5 minutes. This is for the three of you, or either of the three of you. My assumption--well, I don't want to assume. Do you believe that we absolutely must include the Community Reinvestment Act in this legislation, assuming of course that we can somehow prevent illegal immigrants who work for ACORN from benefiting, do you think that this has to be an inseparable part of this new consumer protection agency?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","Congressman, by the way, Kansas City was my ``big city'' when I grew up.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Where are you from?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","Lawrence.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Lord help us.","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","Exactly. I think it makes sense for the Community Reinvestment Act to be part of the new agency because the agency is so concerned with access to credit and credit quality. And those two things are at the core of CRA.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","My organization does not really work on CRA issues. But I can tell you that as I was writing my testimony and the particular history on Rent-a-Bank, payday lending where the banks are lending their preemption rights to the payday lenders, I was struck--I had help on the testimony from Jean Ann Fox at the Consumer Federation. I was struck by the important role that CRA played in eventually bringing-- eventually, it was one of the rare successes, all four of the banking agencies, to realize that this was not appropriate and shutting it down.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Mr. Carr.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","Yes. First of all, I am on the executive committee of Americans for Financial Reform. It is the official position of the organization that CRA should and must be included in the new consumer protection agency. Second of all, I will go back to something I said in my opening comments. The goal of that agency is to ensure access to safe and sound products, and it can't do so to minority communities if it is only looking at individuals, because the financial system doesn't treat individuals the same in minority communities. They treat them as markets. And so getting at systemic issues of failing to lend-- failing to lend, as opposed to using exploitive products--the Community Reinvestment Act is the only real act that really promotes and holds banks and other financial institutions-- well, banks now, hopefully other financial institutions-- accountable for proactively lending in communities and not ignoring the legitimate credit needs. So if it is not in that agency, we have left a major piece of support for minority communities out. The second thing is that we should understand that that agency will have that accumulated knowledge and expertise of researchers, data--how will it in any way enhance their jobs to have the people who look at things at a geographic and at a market's level--systemic market level not part of those daily conversations, sharing of information and, ultimately, the creation of products and the enforcement of the law? It must be in order for that agency to work as it is designed. It must be able to look at broad-based community lending.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","You don't all have to answer. Just give me some signal. Based on your answer, then, you would support a civil rights division of the financial consumer protection agency?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","I would.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","That is also part of, I think, an official position of Americans for Financial Reform, which we--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes. I know yours. Thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And also I want to thank all the panelists. You all have done a remarkably excellent job, and I appreciate the time you have taken. Let me get right to my point. One of the things I have been trying to focus on yesterday and today is to ask some of the people who represent the Fed--and even yesterday, the bankers-- about this issue of what takes precedence--what will take precedence, what has taken precedence--prudential regulation or consumer interests? Based on the long amount of time that has transpired between the Fed having the authority to make rules regarding good mortgages and the time they actually came up with something--credit cards, overdrafts, all of this stuff--does the length of time that has transpired give us any indication as to how the Fed has grappled with these two conflicting portfolios and which one has prevailed? Do you understand my question?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","I do, Congressman. I want to relate a personal experience that--I was on the Consumer Advisory Council of the Fed from 2002 to 2004, and this was exactly the period when we--consumer advocates were urging the Fed to adopt the unfair and deceptive rules that it delayed until 2008. We pressed for 3 years with no success to have that rule adopted. We were told endlessly why the Fed could not do it, would not do it; and I have to say, I was so frustrated because we were not listened to. Subsequently, a Fed staffer said, ``You were right, we were wrong, but we didn't listen to you because you only told stories of individual consumers.''","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","Congressman, if I could just--","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Mr. Carr, please.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","I think we should recognize that it took until the middle of 2008 to actually release final regs on HOEPA to deal with this issue. And even at that time, some of the most egregious predatory practices still weren't purged. For example, yield spread premiums, which are basically kickbacks, were still allowable, as well as weaknesses on issues such as assignee liability, prepayment penalties. And this is knee deep into the crisis. Those issues have now only recently been taken on again.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Ms. Saunders?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","If I could just add, in addition to the length of time which, of course, says something about priorities, what triggered the action? It wasn't just how long it took, it is that nothing happened until Chairman Frank and others said, ``Use it or lose it.'' And they were under threat of losing that authority and Congress was considering credit card bills and predatory lending bills and it was clear that they were under the gun and they had to do it. And in the end, you know, that is what it took, a threat, an ultimatum to get action.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you for elaborating on that. Do you see any reason why there couldn't be joint exams with prudential and consumer regulators? Because some people seem to be really concerned about a potential conflict between the two. I mean, I don't see it as a huge problem. I see it--first of all, I see conflicts as having happened already; they just were resolved in the way you all just described in favor of the prudential regulator, in favor of the industry. So now there might be a fair chance for the consumer, and that might somehow manifest into a conflict that we can see. But I guess my question is, if there is a potential conflict, can you envision a few ways in which these things might be worked out?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","I can. First of all, I think joint examinations are entirely feasible. There are other parts of financial services regulation where it happens very well, such as an insurance regulation. But let me suggest this. We know on very rare occasions that agencies do have irreconcilable conflicts. For example, under Gramm-Leach-Bliley, the SEC and the Federal banking regulators couldn't agree on the push-out provisions. And a way to resolve that is to allow them, the agency, to refer the matter to GAO. It does a report to Congress, and Congress is advised of the issue and if GAO's recommendation is to the resolution. I think that is a great tiebreaker.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Carr","Congressman, if I could just say for 5 seconds, I think the absence of conflict would be a failure of mission, which is exactly what we have right now. One would expect that given the types of deceptive and exploited practices happening, you would be having lots of conflicts for the last decade. The absence is a problem.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thirty seconds, Mr. Chairman, or no?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Just to sort of wrap up, have you all thought about how we might fund the agency?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","I was saying before the hearing that funding is a really hard issue to figure out, and I don't have a good solution except to say that the agency needs adequate funding, which the SEC has not had. And the funding system needs to make certain that the agency does not become captive to large financial services providers. Those, to me, are the two overriding goals.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","And if we cannot get this independent regulatory board, which I believe we need and I support fully, can we at least change the situation so that the bankers don't have their advisory board at the Fed and then have half an advisory board on the consumers?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","I take it that is a rhetorical question of this panel?","Speech"," "
"Ms. McCoy","Even if the consumers have their own board and there are no bankers on it, that will not solve the problem. It is just not enough.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes to conclude this. Ms. Saunders, I think you may have addressed some of the concerns that I was beginning to feel about the potential for conflict between a new consumer regulatory agency and leaving some consumer responsibilities, consumer protection responsibilities. You pointed out some things in the legislation that--I am a cosponsor of that--I was not aware of. It would be helpful, I think, if you--all three of you--looked closer at that because what we do not need is conflict between consumer regulation in one place and consumer regulation in the other place. And I think we may have addressed it appropriately in the statute. Ms. Saunders seems to suggest that in her testimony. I take it you stand by that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","I do. I would also like to point out, though, that the proposal is basically to remove pretty much all of it into the new agency. The Fed would retain backup enforcement authority.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","But then I am thinking that maybe if there is a potential for conflict, we may need to be removing even more of it. That was the conflict that I--now, the second question that the industry has raised over and over again, this potential for conflict between consumer and prudential. I keep having trouble identifying even what that is all about. The regulator, Ms. Duke, didn't suggest that that potential existed today, but the industry keeps telling me that there is a conflict between consumer regulation and prudential regulation. And is anybody able to tell me one instance where that would raise its head?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","I was actually looking for those examples in industry testimony yesterday as I was preparing, and the ones that I came up with from their examples--interesting that Mr. Ireland did not repeat them this morning when you challenged him--one was check hold times. Now, the Expedited Funds Act actually is not one of the ones being proposed and given to the new agency. It would stay with the Fed. But let's assume that it was going. The idea is that the banks say, ``We have operational issues on how we clear checks and we have fraud issues and we just can't speed it up.'' And of course the consumer is saying, ``We want our money now.'' Why couldn't this agency take that into consideration? Nobody wants fraudulent checks cleared. Like any other agency, it is going to balance the issues.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","If you really got to a fork in the road where you had a real conflict, which nobody has really been able to identify to me--it is even hard for me to imagine who would--I guess then the question becomes, who takes precedence, the consumer or the bank? How would you resolve that?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Saunders","In the end, somebody has to decide; and the structure of this agency is that the agency decides. But it has a regulator on the board and Congress looking over its shoulder, and I am confident that it is not going to ignore serious safety and soundness issues.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Watt","Final point and final question, because I do confess to a level of ambivalence on this CRA issue that Representative Cleaver raised. I am still somewhat ambivalent. I understand your position that an integral part of CRA should be in this consumer agency, but I would hate to think of a scenario in which CRA responsibility and duties don't continue to reside over on the regulatory side also, because I would hate for them to say, you know--that is not our thing anymore to oversee that. So let me get you all to just think about that a little bit. Not that I am--the legislation that we introduced kept it where it is in the existing regulators. There may be some way to accomplish what you all have suggested would be the legitimate consumer regulatory part of it through some language to make sure that they are monitoring it, and still give the primary responsibility to the regulators who are out there pushing the banks and financial institutions regularly through their examination process. But that is--I am--my jury is still out on that; and I would love to hear more. But we have run out of time, unfortunately, and my time has expired. The Chair notes that some members may have additional questions for this panel, which they may wish to submit in writing or which maybe have been raised today; and we would welcome your written responses to--such as the last one that I raised. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. We thank you all so much. All of you were just outstanding witnesses, and your written testimony was outstanding also. I have commended it--put Ms. McCoy's testimony, in fact, in the hearing record of the full committee this morning; and we will make sure that the other two written testimonies get circulated widely also. We thank you for your participation, and with that--with nothing further for the good of the cause, as they say in my church--the hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
