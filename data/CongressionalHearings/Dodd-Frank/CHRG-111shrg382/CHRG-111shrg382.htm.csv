"Senator Bayh","I would like to call the Subcommittee to order and thank our witnesses for being with us today. I am well aware of how busy you are, and so in the midst of all the other things you have to deal with, I am very grateful for your insights. I apologize for being a little bit late. I was waylaid by some well-intended members of the fourth estate who, for some reason, wanted to talk about health care. But the matter that we are here today to discuss is very important. We will be turning to that very shortly, and so I am grateful for your presence. I am pleased to call the Subcommittee to order for our hearing entitled ``The International Cooperation to Modernize Financial Regulation.'' I want to begin by thanking Chairman Dodd of the Banking Committee as a whole and his hard-working staff for their cooperation and assistance in arranging this hearing and for the Chairman's support in looking into these important matters. I would also like to welcome my friend and colleague, Ranking Member Corker--I am grateful for his leadership on these and other matters--and my other colleagues on the Committee who are with us. Some will be with us later in person. Others will be reading the testimony. I want to thank them for their interest in this matter. To our three witnesses, I want to welcome you and thank you for appearing before the Subcommittee to give an outline on the efforts underway to harmonize our collective financial regulations. I understand these few weeks have been very busy for all three of you, with the G-20 summit and upcoming meetings abroad. I appreciate your rearranging your schedules and your overseas travel to be with us here today. Once again, thank you for your consideration. Our panel today consists of our country's leading representatives and experts on international economic and financial affairs, so I look forward to our upcoming dialog. But first I would like to go over why we are here today and why the international element of our financial regulatory overhaul is critical to our global economic recovery. One year ago, our country experienced a financial crisis fueled by home foreclosures and institutional failure. The markets dropped drastically and credit began to freeze as banks refused to lend to families, businesses, and even to one another. It soon became apparent that no one was immune. Our financial crisis quickly became a full-blown economic crisis, complete with a housing decline and our Nation shedding, on average, 700,000 jobs each month. My home State of Indiana was hit particularly hard. It was clear Congress needed to intervene with massive Government assistance to help stabilize our financial markets and prevent complete economic collapse. As I said at the time, it was a ``distasteful but necessary step to protect millions of innocent people.'' Now, 1 year later we are on the path to recovery. It will take some time for our financial system to completely heal, but in the meantime, it is our responsibility and the duty of lawmakers to be willing to take the steps necessary toward long-term reform to make sure this situation does not happen again. The Senate Banking Committee has already held approximately 30 hearings since this January on the issue of financial regulatory modernization. It would be challenging enough to reform our regulatory scheme here in the United States and ignore the efforts internationally. But that would neglect our economic reality. We live in an interconnected global economy, and as we have seen, that means interconnected global problems. Vulnerabilities and gaps in financial markets abroad can impact us here substantially at home. Any reform or rules we enact here at some level should be matched or harmonized abroad to ensure capital does not gravitate to the lowest common denominator. We sometimes refer to that as regulatory arbitrage. Two weeks ago, in a speech before Wall Street, President Obama reaffirmed his commitment to financial regulatory modernization and the need to close the gaps and harmonize our collective rules. He stressed that the United States needs to play a leadership role in lifting our global regulatory standards to ensure there is a global race to the top. This is necessary to, number one, prevent the regulatory arbitrage I just mentioned that puts our entire financial system at risk; and, number two, make sure we remain competitive with other nations. In light of that commitment, we are moving forward with today's hearing to show our support for this critical component of regulatory reform. Today we will hear from our three witnesses on the work that is underway to coordinate our regulatory structures. We have already laid the foundation to begin this process. In an effort to coordinate financial regulatory reforms, world leaders began working together at a series of international meetings to address changes in policy, regulations, oversight, and enforcement. The first was in November of 2008 here in Washington, D.C. At that meeting, the leaders approved an action plan that included instructing their Finance Ministers to make specific recommendations in a number of areas. Some of the most important included: avoiding regulatory policies that exacerbate ups and downs of the business cycle, reviewing incentives for risk taking and innovation reflected in executive compensation practices, and strengthening the regulatory scheme for credit derivatives and reducing their systemic risk. The G-20's next meeting was in April 2009 in London. There the leaders focused on the issues of coordination and oversight of an international financial system with the creation of the Financial Stability Board. The Financial Stability Board is an extension of a previous international organization, the Financial Stability Forum, with an expanded membership to include all G-20 countries, Spain, and the European Commission. Our three witnesses today are the United States' representatives to the Financial Stability Board, and I look forward to hearing their thoughts on this reinvented organization and how effective it will be in enacting change. Leaders of the London Summit also agreed to work on cross- border cooperation, closer regulation of banks, hedge funds, and credit rating agencies, and a crackdown on tax havens--all important issues. Last, the United States asserted our leadership in these international economic issues by hosting the Pittsburgh Summit just last week. I am particularly interested in hearing from our witnesses on what was accomplished at the G-20 Summit in Pittsburgh on the international harmonization aspects of regulatory reform. Specifically, we would like to know the U.S. goals of the summit, if the objectives were accomplished, the roles played by the respective governmental witnesses, and the status of any proposals presented by the Financial Stability Board. The conventional wisdom on international coordination is that at summits countries talk globally but afterwards act only locally. This hearing and the oversight our Subcommittee will conduct on this issue throughout this lengthy process is one way to ensure that the momentum is not lost. However, the work is not completely laid at the feet of the administration and our international standard-setting entities. Congress has some responsibility in this debate as well. The biggest question for Congress is how much our regulatory modernization should be harmonized with international norms and standards and what we should do when there are conflicts on proposals that may not be consistent with U.S. interests or what Congress prefers. These are difficult questions. But I trust that my colleagues here in the Senate and the witnesses sitting before us today are willing to put in the work to make sure that we make the right decisions and get something done. Let me close by reiterating how critical these efforts are to our global economic recovery and future success. Last year, as Congress passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, popularly known as TARP, I said: I am not a cynic, but I am a skeptic about the way Washington can work in times like these. Congress will act in a moment of crisis, but once it is abated, the sense of urgency will dissipate. The forces of reform will not have the energy that they have today. All the interests will circle this place like hungry birds looking for carrion in order to prevent us from taking the steps that are necessary. We must not let that happen. Here we are a year later, and we must remain committed to seeing through long-term reform. We need to bring the same sense of urgency that was so palpable during the crisis. And now before we hear from our witnesses, I would like to turn to my distinguished colleagues, and I would like to acknowledge the presence of our Ranking Member of the entire Banking Committee, my friend Senator Shelby. Senator, thank you for your presence.","Speech",""
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","And I am not sure what the appropriate protocol is here, gentlemen. Robert, I had intended to turn to you, and it looks as if the Ranking Member agrees with that, so I will turn to my colleague Senator Corker for any opening remarks that he might like to make, although, Bob, I have been informed of something we call the Corker rule, which has to do with your unusual habit for a Senator of being very brief. So I do not know if you intend to invoke the Corker rule today or not, but you are not obligated to.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Listen, Mr. Chairman, I am looking forward to serving with you on this Committee, and I like working with you on numbers of issues. I am not fond of opening statements and not known for them, and I do not plan on changing that today. So thank you for coming as witnesses. We look forward to your testimony, and I do think our distinguished Ranking Member has someone in particular he wants to embellish, but certainly wisdom he wants to share with all of us. So, Mr. Ranking Member.","Statement","OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR BOB CORKER"
"Senator Shelby","I believe I will stay with the Corker rule. By osmosis, you know, we are picking it up day by day. But, Mr. Chairman, this is, I think, a very timely hearing and a very needed hearing dealing with international cooperation, dealing with our financial regulation, our accounting system, and everything that goes with it. So I look forward to today's witnesses. Thank you very much.","Statement","OPENING STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY"
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Senator Shelby, very much. It is now my privilege to introduce our witnesses. Why don't I start moving from the panel's right to the panel's left, and I have very lengthy and detailed synopses of your very distinguished careers. I am going to dispense with that and just give your titles, and I will have the entire introductions entered into the record for those who are interested in the entire resume.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","First, Mark Sobel. Mark is the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Monetary and Financial policy in the United States Treasury Department. Mark, thank you for your presence, and we are well aware of how busy things are in the Department these days. And please thank the Secretary for his cooperation in making your presence possible here today. Second, Commissioner Kathleen Casey. Ms. Casey is an SEC Commissioner and the SEC representative to the Financial Stability Board. Kathleen, thank you for your good work at the Commission, and I am grateful for your time here today. Finally, we have the Honorable Daniel Tarullo who has been kind enough to appear before our Subcommittee before. Daniel, it is good to see you once again. He took office as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve on January 28, 2009. You have had no lack of things to do since that time as well, Dan, so I am grateful for your insights and your testimony here today. Thank you and, Mark, let us begin with you, Mr. Sobel. You might want to push the microphone--there you go.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","It has been pushed for me. OK. Thank you. Thank you for this opportunity to testify on international efforts to promote regulatory reform, especially following the Pittsburgh Summit. Immediately after the start of the crisis, policymakers and regulators worldwide redoubled efforts to repair financial systems and put in place a stronger regulatory and supervisory framework so that a crisis of the magnitude we have witnessed does not occur again. Good progress is being made, and much was achieved already through the Washington and London G-20 Summits. We strengthened prudential oversight, reached agreement to extend the scope of regulation, strengthened international cooperation, and have taken action to deal with jurisdictions that failed to commit to high-quality standards. A fundamental objective of the Pittsburgh Summit was to build on these accomplishments. Leaders agreed on four priorities: Capital. They agreed to develop rules to improve the quantity and quality of capital and to discourage excessive leverage by end 2010. This agreement tracks closely with Secretary Geithner's principles issued earlier this month. On compensation, leaders endorsed the implementation of standards to help financial institutions and regulators better align compensation with long-term value and risk management. National supervisors will impose corrective measures on firms with unsound practices. On OTC derivatives, they agreed that all standardized OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic trading platforms and cleared through central counterparties by end 2012. Non-centrally cleared contracts will be subject to higher capital requirements. On cross-border resolution, they agreed to strengthen domestic resolution frameworks and that prudential standards for the largest, most interconnected firms should be commensurate with the costs of their failure. Leaders also called on international accounting bodies to redouble efforts to achieve a single set of high-quality, global accounting standards. Firms are now global in scope, as you noted, Mr. Chairman, and we derive benefits from open, interconnected markets. But the crisis highlighted that financial duress can spread quickly across national boundaries. And while the responsibility for sound regulation begins at home, different national standards open the possibility for regulatory arbitrage, gaps in oversight, and a race to the bottom. International cooperation is essential to avoid these pitfalls. Throughout the crisis, standard setters and other bodies, in addition to the G-20, have helped in this effort. But one body, the Financial Stability Board, has played a critical role in promoting international financial stability. Founded as the Financial Stability Forum in the aftermath of the Asia crisis with strong U.S. support, it brought G-7 officials together with key standard-setting bodies. At the outset of the crisis, the G-7 asked the forum to analyze the causes of the crisis and provide recommendations to increase the resilience of markets and institutions. Those recommendations have been at the center of the international consensus on how to overhaul the world's financial regulatory system. In April, with strong U.S. backing, the Financial Stability Forum was reconstituted as the Financial Stability Board, with an enhanced mandate and membership now encompassing all G-20 countries. The FSB has been a key venue to prepare for G-20 leaders summits. I have provided greater detail in my written testimony on the FSB's purposes and functioning. In the United States, we have set out a proposal for comprehensive regulatory reform, but to promote a global race to the top, we need our G-20 partners to be equally ambitious. The three institutions we represent have worked closely together in preparing for FSB meetings. In addition, U.S. regulatory officials are heavily involved in setting the agenda for international standard setters. This strong cooperation between U.S. and international officials is reflected in the closely aligned agendas pursued by the FSB in the United States and has allowed us to forge more consistent global standards in line with the U.S. agenda. As part of our work to help ensure a cohesive national vision at the international level, U.S. officials also coordinate through the President's Working Group on Financial Markets and at a working level conference calls hosted by Treasury with U.S. regulators to discuss implementation of the G-20 leaders and FSB work. Looking forward, consistent national implementation throughout the G-20 will increasingly be our focus. The FSB will be an important forum to assess progress. Despite our achievements, much more remains to be done. Some of the flaws in the U.S. financial system and regulatory framework that allowed this crisis to occur are still in place. In conclusion, the United States has led the effort to create the FSB, shape its agenda, expand its membership, and involve it closely in the G-20's work. In turn, the Financial Stability Board has been a key instrument for policy development. We can be confident knowing that the machinery to strengthen the international financial system is in place and has set forth principles for reform that are consistent with the administration's own plan. Again, thank you for having me here today.","Statement","STATEMENT OF MARK SOBEL, ACTING ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY"
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Sobel.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","Chairman Bayh, Ranking Member Corker, and members of the Committee, thank you for inviting me to testify about the international cooperation to modernize financial regulation. I am very pleased to have the opportunity to testify on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission on this very important topic. International cooperation is critical to the effectiveness of financial regulatory reform efforts. In reaffirming their commitment to strengthening the global financial system, the G-20 Finance Ministers and Bank Governors recently set forth a number of actions to ``maintain momentum make the system more resilient.'' The G-20 banking statement correctly recognizes that, due to the mobility of capital in today's world of interconnected financial markets, activity can easily shift from one market to another. Only collective regulatory action can be effective in fully addressing cross-border activity in our global financial system. As an SEC Commissioner and Chairman of the Technical Committee of the International Organization of Securities Commissions, I bring the perspective of both a national securities market regulator and a member of the international organization charged with developing a global response to the challenges posed to securities markets by the financial crisis. I also represent the SEC and IOSCO in the Financial Stability Board, where the U.S. representation is led by the Department of Treasury, with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Federal Reserve Board both serving as members. The financial crisis has made it clear that there are regulatory gaps that we must address. The Commission has recently proposed action to this end in a number of different areas, recognizing, however, that some regulatory gaps and market issues cannot be fully addressed without legislative action. The SEC already is working to achieve consistency on the domestic and international levels, including through IOSCO and the FSB, with banking, insurance, futures, and other financial market regulators. The Commission also is working to ensure respect for the integrity of independent accounting and auditing standard-setting processes in the global regulatory environment. This is essential for the benefit and protection of investors. The Commission has worked actively to achieve consistency in regulatory policy and implementation on an international basis through multilateral, regional, and bilateral mechanisms for many years. The SEC was a founding member of IOSCO and has maintained a leading role in the organization. The Commission's commitment to international cooperation has become increasingly important to its mission in recent years in response to the increasingly global nature of financial markets. In addition to my chairmanship of IOSCO's Technical Committee, Commission staff leads or is very active in IOSCO's standing committees and task forces, as well as many other multilateral organizations. While IOSCO represents the primary vehicle for development of common international approaches to securities market regulation, the Financial Stability Board is another key mechanism for the Commission to engage internationally on broader financial market issues. The Financial Stability Board has a broader scope, with membership comprised of national regulatory and supervisory authorities, standard-setting bodies, and international financial institutions, central bankers, and Finance Ministers. Its mission is to address vulnerabilities and to encourage the development of strong regulatory, supervisory, and other policies in the interest of financial stability. In addition to multilateral global engagement, the Commission participates in regional and bilateral mechanisms for discussion and promotion of common approaches to regulation, such as our engagement in a number of Treasury-led regulatory dialogues, including with the European Commission, Japan, China, and India, as well as with Australia and our North American partners, Canada and Mexico. Securities-regulatory-focused dialogues between the Commission and our counterpart securities regulators in these and other jurisdictions also complement these broader financial sector dialogues. Recently, the Commission and a number of other securities regulators have also entered into bilateral ``supervisory'' memoranda of understanding that go well beyond sharing information on enforcement investigations. These supervisory MOUs represent ground-breaking efforts by national securities regulators to work together to cooperate in the oversight of financial firms that increasingly operate across borders. As these efforts suggest, the infrastructure for international cooperation on securities regulatory policy is well developed, and the Commission plays a key role in promoting rising levels of cooperation and building on our successes in raising standards of cross-border enforcement cooperation. Today the SEC has broad authority to share supervisory information as well as to assist foreign securities authorities in their investigations through various tools, including exercising the SEC's compulsory powers to obtain documents and testimony. In order to facilitate international cooperation, the SEC supports legislation providing authority to the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board, which the SEC oversees, to share confidential supervisory information with foreign counterparts. The Commission believes that granting this authority to the PCAOB would enhance auditor oversight, audit quality, and, ultimately, investor protection. In closing, the Commission looks forward to continuing the ongoing constructive dialogue with our colleagues at the Fed, Treasury, and other agencies, in developing common U.S. position on international cooperation in the future. While the Commission's particular focus--and that of IOSCO on investor protection and efficient and fair markets has remained constant and somewhat distinct from that of banking supervisors and regulators of other market segments, our recent collaborative work, both at home and internationally, continues to enhance our ability to identify and address systemic risks across the world's financial markets and will be central to efforts to strengthen the global financial regulatory system. Thank you again for the opportunity to testify, and I look forward to taking your questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF KATHLEEN L. CASEY, COMMISSIONER, SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION"
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Ms. Casey.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Corker, and Ranking Member Shelby. As Chairman Bayh noted, in less than a year we have had three G-20 leaders meetings at which financial stability was either the sole subject or, as in Pittsburgh last week, one of the most important subjects. During this period, the Financial Stability Board has emerged as an important forum for identifying, analyzing, and setting in motion coordinated responses to the financial crisis and to regulatory gaps and shortcomings. There is much promise in what is now a lengthy agenda for the Financial Stability Board and the many other important groups intended to foster international regulatory cooperation. But there is also some risk that progress will get bogged down or that the negotiation of standards or recommendations in a particular area will become an end in itself. Needless to say, it is essential to ensure that well- devised standards are implemented effectively by all participating countries and that problems revealed during this implementation are cooperatively addressed and changes made. As we look ahead from Pittsburgh and all the international meetings that preceded it, I would offer a few thoughts on how we should proceed from here. First, it is important for the U.S. representatives to the FSB and other groups to focus on the topics and initiatives that we believe are most significant for promoting global financial stability and that are also susceptible to practical international cooperative action. My prepared testimony covers a number of these areas, but I would like to draw particular attention to the emphasis of the G-20 leaders on improvements to capital requirements, which is both an appropriate and critical emphasis. Second, we will need to work with our counterparts from other countries to rationalize the activities of the many international organizations and groups whose mandates involve financial stability. While overlap among these various institutions can sometimes be useful in fostering alternative ideas and approaches, uncoordinated duplication of effort can be inefficient and sometimes even counterproductive. A third and related point is that the expansion of both membership and mandate in certain of these international groups will require changes in operating procedures in order to maintain some of the advantages these groups have had. Fourth, while the financial crisis has understandably, and appropriately, concentrated international energies and attentions on the new standards that will be necessary to protect financial stability, we must guard against these fora being transformed into exclusively negotiating entities. One of the virtues of the original Financial Stability Forum was that is provided a venue for participating officials to exchange views on current developments and problems in a relatively unstructured fashion that provided at least the potential for new ideas to emerge. Similarly, a number of the international standard-setting bodies, such as the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, traditionally provided a venue for senior supervisors to understand the perspectives of their foreign counterparts and at times to develop shared views of common supervisory challenges, quite apart from the negotiation of new international standards. These other purposes of international financial regulatory groups are, in my view, useful both as ends in themselves and as mechanisms to reinforce the implementations of the standards previously promulgated by these groups. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to answer any questions you or your colleagues may have.","Statement","STATEMENT OF DANIEL K. TARULLO, MEMBER, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Tarullo, and thank you to the other panelists. Why don't I work in reverse order and start with you. On the issue of systemic risk, experts point out that the regulatory reform discussion during the summit meetings has still been fairly vague on critical and complex issues, like systemic risk, cross-border resolution authority, and what to do about derivatives. However, the political hot button issue of executive compensation seems to have been more on a fast track. My question is: What do you think we can end up doing on the issue of systemic risk, which gets to the heart of the problem that we face? And will we have more than just--and I understand there is a lot going on. It is a full plate. These things take time. But do you think we will end up with something more than unenforceable, you know, vague standards this time? Or can we look forward to something more specific with some real enforceability to it?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Mr. Chairman, I think the agenda responding to systemic risk is in some sense the biggest part of both the FSB's agenda and much of what the G-20 said. So it is not any one initiative. I would say that the elements of that agenda, internationally as domestically, are mutually reinforcing. So with respect to higher capital standards, for example, I think both higher capital standards applied to existing international agreements and new ideas about how to take steps that contain systemic risk are going to be equally important. The agenda for strengthening capital standards is well underway. There has been some progress already. I think the G-20 Summit is going to catalyze some more progress.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Is this difficult for the Europeans, given the condition of several of their financial institutions?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I think it is going to be a challenge for most countries because we are talking about significant increases in capital over time. I think you probably noted that the G-20 leaders want to move forward with the agreement on tighter, stricter, more robust capital standards now, but the implementation of those standards is presumably going to take place as the financial institutions themselves strengthen. I think that with respect to some of these newer ideas, one I would draw your attention to is that of contingent capital requirements for large institutions. I think that is an example of where we in the United States have an opportunity to exercise some leadership to produce some good, innovative ideas that will bring market discipline and some protection for taxpayers to each of these very large financial institutions. And so I think that is one of the reasons why we and our colleagues have been promoting those ideas internationally and hope we see some progress on it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Mr. Sobel, or any of the three of you, the topic of derivatives came up several years ago and you mentioned that there have been some general statements in the Pittsburgh gathering about the importance of moving forward on this. The response that we always got previously to this was, well, if you regulate these instruments more closely in the United States, we will just take the business offshore and the risks will be run. It is just that there won't be the employment in the United States. So it is kind of a lose-lose situation. Do you think we will come up with something more specific and enforceable this time to prevent that kind of forum shopping?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","I think one of the main points I wanted to emphasize today is that I think that there is real solid agreement in the G-20, in the FSB, certainly among the main players, certainly in the standard-setting bodies, such as the Committee on Payments and Settlement Systems, to really tackle these issues to make significant progress on them. So I think that the agreements that we have reached, for example, in Pittsburgh, there is a good paragraph there about our agreement on over-the-counter derivatives markets. I think it is a very firmly rooted and earnest agreement. There was no debate about it on the table, and the CPPs are beginning to get up and running. There is business happening on those exchanges. So I am confident that we are going to push forward. Secretary Geithner has had a personal and strong interest in this area dating back several years to when he was President of the New York Fed to bring transparency and greater data collection to this effort. So I am confident that we are going to push forward in this area.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Well, I am confident of the Secretary's interest in this issue, as well, and his good faith efforts. I am a little more concerned about some of the other global players and would ask you, particularly in the area of derivatives, is there an enforcement mechanism for the standards that are going to be hopefully a consensus formed around? What will the role of the IMF be? The IMF is a wonderful institution. I have great respect for them. But historically, in some areas, they don't really have much of a way to enforce some of their authorities.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","The way I see the answer to that question, Mr. Chairman, we are going to work together really hard with----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","And I had currency manipulation in mind, not--when they have loaned money to countries, they do have leverage there. But in some other areas--and they can make pronouncements, but moral suasion doesn't seem to be enough in some cases.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","In terms of making progress on OTC and this enforcement question that you have raised, the way I see the answer to that question--and it is not just the OTC area, it pertains to other areas--is that we are going to work together really hard. We are going to work through the standards-setting bodies. We are going to work through the FSB to raise standards, to seek agreements. And then taking the standards, it is a question for national supervisors to implement while continuing the cooperative efforts that we are building. So ultimately, I see enforcement as having to happen at the national level, but we need to use the FSB to make sure that everybody is on the same page and that we are marching forward together.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","We will have multilateral standards but national enforcement. That may be the best we can come up with, but that does raise the prospect of different jurisdictions taking different levels of zeal in enforcing these things, which gets us back to the problem of forum shopping and regulatory arbitrage and all that kind of thing. Is this just a dilemma that we can only hope to limit but never completely eradicate?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","In my view, we live in a world in which regulation is a national-based activity, but we do have global markets, as you were outlining in your opening statements. I think the question is, how do we bring these forces together? My answer is, one, I think the United States, and the Secretary in particular, are exercising a great deal of leadership. The FSB agenda, I think, is aligned very much with our principles for regulatory reform. You see that very clearly in the agreements reached in Pittsburgh on capital. Second, I have talked about the effort to raise standards. Again, I think this is a strong international commitment. I think leadership committed to it. I think that is going to put extra backbone to the effort. This is definitely the case with respect to the systemically significant firms, to make sure that they operate under a tougher regime. You know, one area where we are always--the subject of gaps comes up relates to, for example, the non-cooperative jurisdictions. And here, I think the Secretary in March, just after assuming office, put forward a three-pronged approach to basically raise standards in the prudential tax information exchange and anti-money laundering effort, and this was a major aspect of the April summit. Since then, you have seen substantial progress. You have seen many tax information exchanges signed around the world. We have put in place a process through a global forum, an OECD body, to develop carrots and sticks, which will be announced in March 2010. And similarly, we are working through the FATF processes and a new FSB process to raise adherence to standard by all jurisdictions. So I think that when you raise this question about gaps and arbitrage, you are putting your finger on a definite issue, a totally legitimate issue, and as you said, it is not an easy one to deal with, but we are bound and determined to do our best and we have our eye on the ball.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you. I am going to turn to my colleagues now. They have been most patient. I just observe, I very much appreciate the focus of the Secretary, the hard work that is being done in the Department. I know this is a very difficult diplomatic issue. We have made some progress here and in some other tangentially related areas. The Swiss are beginning to perhaps change some of their practices with regard to tax avoidance and that sort of thing, but it is a challenge we face when nation states enforce the rules but the consequences of their lack of diligence and enforcement go way beyond the border of those nation states. And given the experience we have just come through, heaven help us if we permit a repetition. But I understand it is a very difficult issue. Senator Corker?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and thank you for your testimony. I think it is great that the G-20 is working together on so many of these issues. I think it will be interesting to see whether, as time moves on, this solidifies or sort of fragments, which I think could be a challenge as you move ahead. One of the issues that has been mentioned is just the whole procyclical nature of the way that we deal with our financial markets. I think it is interesting, Mr. Sobel, that you shared that as one of the issues that you all are working on, obviously, at the G-20. Here in our country, I think as history records what is happening right now, it will say, as it has in the past, that the herd mentality took over and that our regulators helped create, in many ways, a self-fulfilling prophecy. I think that is happening right now as really insane things are being asked at the local markets by regulators because of their concern about various types of credits. Obviously, when the market is rising, everybody levers up against appreciating assets. What is it that is being looked at--I would say the first thing we need to do is look at home. I think the OCC is in many ways creating far greater problems in our country than would otherwise exist. I don't think it, I would bet on that in major ways. But what are we doing at the G-20 level to focus on the whole procyclical nature of the way regulators work? They exacerbate bubbles and exacerbate problems.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","Let me lead off, and if any of my colleagues, on the basis of their work, would like to amplify, I will turn the floor to them. I would say in the G-20 context, the main area of discussion relates to capital, the capital area. So, in essence, there is a feeling, obviously, that we didn't have enough capital in the system, but there is also a belief that banks should have more capital, that they should be able to draw down their capital in bad times. So there is a lot of work that is being now undertaken in the Basel Committee which has been referenced in the Pittsburgh Summit communique about establishing countercyclical buffers of capital. There are obviously broader macroeconomic questions you raise that lie more in the domain of other institutions than the Treasury. But again, the main focus has been on the countercyclical cushions. I don't know if any of my colleagues would like to----","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","So as the markets are rising, more capital is required, and as the markets are declining, less capital----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","Yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","----the opposite of what we are doing right now in our country.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","Yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Well, let me ask you this, just out of curiosity. Why would we talk about this theory to save the world and yet not put it in practice today in our country? I am just curious. And maybe others might want to jump in.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, a couple of things. First, I think your identification of procyclicality is right on target. In my observation, problems of procyclicality pervade the financial regulatory system, and indeed they pervade financial practice. At some level, Senator, financial regulatory capital requirements of any sort are themselves procyclical, because when you think about it, if you have a capital requirement and a bank is taking losses because of a downturn in the economy, then all of a sudden, their capacity to lend has been reduced. I think what we saw in the run-up to the financial crisis was excessive procyclicality in financial regulation more generally. As Mr. Sobel has said, we definitely saw it in capital requirements. And one of the concerns that I had long before I arrived at the Federal Reserve was that some of the new kinds of capital requirements that were being thought about would increase procyclicality. Second, and Commissioner Casey may want to address this, accounting standards can be procyclical, and that is why her committee and the activities of the FSB on accounting have focused on that, as well. Third, even things as widely accepted and necessary as deposit insurance premium structures can be procyclical. If you are allowing lesser or no payments during good times, that puts you in a situation in which in bad times, the FDIC is in a very difficult position as the deposit insurance fund declines. So I think this is something we have got to think about across the board. Now, to your question of, well, if it is such a good idea, how come we are not already doing it? Let me give a two-part answer to that. First, it is a really attractive concept. In good times, banks have to buildup more capital, and as times aren't so good, they have to draw it down. But as you know, there is often a considerable distance between a really attractive concept and something which is technically feasible and which we know is not going to produce unintended consequences. So a lot of the activity right now, both in the Basel Committee and among the bank regulatory agencies here at home, has been an effort to come up with the right kind of calibration so that we do have the effects that we want to have in countering the traditional procyclicality while not doing more harm along the way. And this is really an integrated effort at this point because I think we would want to see major financial institutions in other countries do it at the same time that our institutions do.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","To just follow up on Dan and Mark's points with respect to the procyclicality focus of the G-20 and the FSB, as Dan mentioned, there is no question that, I think, accounting standards have been a key focus of concern with respect to how they might contribute to procyclical effects on the system, and I think that much of the work that was done in the FSB was largely focused on valuation and leverage questions, as well as looking at existing accounting standards and practices with respect to loan loss provisioning. And just as a more fundamental matter, if I could just step back with respect to accounting, I think from a securities market regulator perspective, one of the key issues that has been raised in this debate about procyclicality is also appreciating the role of accounting standard setting and the purpose of financial reporting, and I think that what we have found is that while there may be legitimate concerns about what the intersection is between accounting standards and capital, capital adequacy issues, at the same time, it is quite important from an independent standard-setting perspective, and again, the purpose and focus of financial reporting remain focused on the interest of investors. So that has been a key interest that we have brought to the table. But that being said, I would say that with respect to our work on provisioning, myself and John Dugan, the head of the-- the Comptroller of the Currency, headed up a working group within the Financial Stability Board aimed at looking at existing provisioning practices and standards, which currently rely on an incurred loss model, to give consideration to whether or not--what impact they do have on procyclicality, whether or not within existing standards there are ways to mitigate that, and then, alternatively, whether or not more forward-looking or alternative models might address procyclicality while also ensuring that an investor interest in terms of getting timely, relevant, decision-useful information could be met. And what we found through our work was that you actually had an interest of both investors as well as prudential regulators in perhaps looking at alternative models that were more forward-looking in terms of identifying credit losses more early in the cycle. And so some of the recommendations that came out of that work stream was intended to encourage the standard setters to look at a variety of different models that would be more forward-looking, including expected loss, dynamic provisioning, and fair value, and that is part of the effort that the standard setters are currently engaged in. But again, just to reinforce, I think that that is an instance perhaps where you have an intersection of interests, where both investors and the interested prudential regulators and broader interested financial stability could potentially be met.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, excuse me. I think the Commissioner is excessively modest here. Her role in trying to move some of these questions forward----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","That is unusual in Washington, D.C.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Her role in trying to move some of these questions forward productively in the FSB, I think has really been critical to getting more of a convergence around some of the very troublesome problems in accounting.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Senator Shelby?","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Commissioner Casey, the Commission has proposed what you call the road map for the potential use of financial statements that were prepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards as issued by the IASB, the standard-setting body that you well know exists in London. Given the tremendous impact of accounting standards in our financial system, are you or any of your Commissioners at the SEC concerned that IASB's independence and objectivity could be compromised? Has that been discussed?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","Thank you, Senator. Sort of to step back to one of the key objectives or goals of G-20 leaders is convergence of accounting standards and the development of a single set of high-quality international accounting standards, and as part of that effort to achieve that goal, you have efforts by both the IASB, the International Accounting Standards Board, and the FASB to try to reconcile where it would improve the standard, reconcile differences between U.S. GAAP and IFRS, and where either standard is lacking, trying to come up with a better converge standard. They have been engaged in this effort for the past several years and I think that much progress has been made. I think over the course of the past year, however, there has been a tremendous amount of pressure placed on standard setters with respect to certainly issues of the appropriate use of fair value, mark-to-market concerns, and I think that what we found as a result of that is that it has placed some question about political pressure brought to bear on these standard setters. That being said, I think that despite that, I think both standard setters remain committed to their best efforts to achieve convergence on key projects, such as the Financial Instruments Project, and I think that as part of that effort, there is no question that the credibility of that process is going to be vital, and I think particularly for here in the United States, where the United States is giving consideration to whether or not we should allow U.S. issuers to use IFRS. And I think central to that will again be confidence in the independence and the credibility of the standard setting process. Again, I think that from the SEC's perspective, we remain committed to supporting both standard setting bodies in their efforts. We remain committed to achieving a single set of high- quality international accounting standards. And I expect in the coming months that the Commission will speak more clearly about the next steps for contemplating potential user adoption of IFRS in the United States for U.S. issuers.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Has the SEC staff considered, to your knowledge, or seen a particular financial statement prepared under the rules of the international standards as opposed to FASB, and how do they work? You are looking for equivalence, aren't you?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","You know----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","How do they work together?","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","There have been a couple of mechanisms we have to take confidence in the application of IFRS and the rigor with which IFRS is being adopted. Certainly, our staff looks at filings of foreign private issuers who currently are allowed to file in IFRS, and so that gives us a very good sense of the quality of their reporting in IFRS. We also have an important workstream underway with the European securities regulators which was undertaken--I think it is actually one of the good examples of bilateral cooperation that we have had, where both the SEC and the CESR have undertaken to look at both the quality and the application of both U.S. GAAP as well as IFRS for large financial institutions that are registered with the SEC and also file in IFRS. And I think that those efforts are going to give us the opportunity to take greater confidence with respect to the state of IFRS and its application in a very company-specific way, and I think, ultimately, that will also assist us in taking judgment as we look to roadmap questions about implementation of IFRS more generally.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Governor Tarullo, you noted that the Basel Committee, and this was referenced already in a sense, has been working on recommendations to improve the resolution of international banking organizations. As banking becomes increasingly global, the U.S. financial regulatory structure, I believe, needs to make sure it can adequately handle the failure of banks operating globally. What are some of the problems with resolving large international banking organizations? And other than the Obama administration's proposal for a new resolution authority, what changes should be made to make it easier for the United States and other countries to resolve large international bank failures, for example?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Thank you, Senator. Let me reemphasize the premise of your question, which is that resolution is very much of a challenge. Let me step back for a second and suggest why it is such a challenge, even more than a lot of the other areas we are talking about. If we want to make changes in capital standards and the FSB gets together and we converge around a set of changes, we all have ample domestic legal authority under our own constitutional structures to go back and make those changes. In the area of resolution, of course, we are talking about bankruptcy law. We are talking about bank insolvency law under the FDI Act, things that the Congress and parliaments around the world have put into legislation. So here, each country has its own set of legal rights and priorities for creditors. We have our own set of laws on what constitutes a fraudulent conveyance, for example. We have our own set of practices as to what kinds of creditor adjustments can be made during a bankruptcy or resolution procedure. So, from some people's point of view, the first best or at least the cleanest solution would be one that would have to harmonize the bankruptcy and resolution mechanisms and laws all around the world----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","And that is no easy task.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I think even to state it, Senator, suggests the difficulty, and when I talked in my opening statement about practical, this is one of the things I had in mind. Let us be practical when we are trying to move resolution forward. So here is what I think we can do. First, I think it is important that each country that has major financial institutions have at least a legal structure that creates the possibility for cooperative action for a failed or failing large financial institution. So here at home, that would mean a resolution mechanism for non-bank large financial institutions. And obviously, you are already thinking about that. Second, there are some things that can be done short of a binding international treaty or harmonization of insolvency regimes to get us closer to the point where we can handle these things better, at least, than they have been in the past, and here are the three things that I think have been the most promising. First, the contingency plans. Now, some people have referred to these as living wills or death plans for the company. You know, the basic idea is that each of the big firms would have to spell out how it could be wound down in the event of a crisis.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","I think we need to ensure that the record shows, Governor, that the death plans have nothing to do with the health care debate.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I am not going there, Senator.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","That is a different committee----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","I just wanted to be clear.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","That is right.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Not yet, anyway.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","I prefer to think of them somewhat more broadly. I think that a contingency plan required of each major financial institution can do three things: One, it can be a very good supervisory tool, because when Lehman Brothers failed, Senator, it had almost 3,000 legal entities under it. So when people thought about resolution, the challenges were enormous to even figure out where are the vulnerabilities----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Were they too big to regulate?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, I do not know. If they had been subject to mandatory prudential regulation, one hopes that this would have been brought into mind.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","OK.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","So one thing you can do, you try to use their planning to get a rational, well-understood relationship among their subsidiaries and, indeed, make sure that you have legal entities aligned with business lines. Second, I think that the plan itself can be one that helps save the firm. If they know where their vulnerabilities and exposures lie and where the cross exposures lie, then as things begin to deteriorate, they are in a better position to act. And one thing we all learned during the crisis was that many firms really did not have a good handle on their own exposures, their own vulnerabilities. Third, if ultimately the firm is not able to survive, the planning may indeed have the salutary effect of helping the supervisors do a more rational job of resolving. Very quickly, the other couple of things I think are probably worth doing internationally are, first, expanding the scope of the so-called supervisory colleges to do some planning for bad things happening, the kind of information flows that different countries would need to know where the capital problems may lie. And, finally, I do think it would be worth the effort to try to get some standardization of a lot of the big contracts that go back and forth internationally. So, for example, termination clauses in various forms of financial contracts, if they were standardized so that each country was looking at the same contractual terms, it would be easier for officials in one nation to think about how they are going to deal with those problems. So I will not for a moment promise you that that solves the problem, but I think it is a practical agenda for moving us forward.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Chairman, could I ask one more question?","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Of course.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Credit rating agencies. Commissioner Casey, you mentioned in your testimony--is IOSCO how you say it? Is that right? IOSCO has refined its code of conduct with respect to credit rating agencies in response to the financial crisis. You have been a strong advocate for removing the Government's stamp of approval from the NRSRO ratings. My question is: Do you believe that if the SEC took meaningful steps to address reliance on ratings in its rules, this would help other countries to seriously consider doing the same thing? Because we are talking in an international context.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","Thank you, Senator. I believe that there is no question that many other jurisdictions, including the United States--and I would even note that the administration's plan notes regulators should look to reduce reliance on ratings wherever possible. But other jurisdictions as well have highlighted this as something that deserves particular attention in light of what we saw through the crisis that came from an undue reliance on the part of investors and markets on ratings. And I think for the SEC in particular, it is an opportunity for us to--and the Commission is currently considering removing--in fact, we have just removed several references in our last rulemaking, recognizing that we still have some daunting challenges with the tough ones, particularly with respect to money funds and then capital references. With that being said, I think that there is no question that I think for the markets and for investors, if we are going to promote the kind of necessary credit analysis that does not necessarily rely on ratings judgments, that I think removing the regulatory imprimatur would be an important step in that respect. I think also that as a result of the ratings references that we have had in our rules, we have played an important role in creating essentially the oligopolistic structure that has dominated and exacerbated the weaknesses and----","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","In other words, no competition.","Speech"," "
"Ms. Casey","No competition. And so I think that what you see is that with the removal of references, it removes that imprimatur and that franchise. It encourages hopefully the right incentives in the market. And I think it complements any kind of regulatory oversight that certainly the SEC has already undertaken pursuant to the law that was drafted in this Committee and passed by the Congress. And I think that there is a recognition that if we were to take those formative steps, longer term we would have probably--we would have much better quality and integrity in ratings than if we were to continue to rely on the regulatory uses that we see in our rules right now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Senator Shelby.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. You are most generous today. Before the G-20 summit, Chairman Bernanke came out with a principles-based compensation process where, instead of looking at firm caps, nominal numbers like French and other governments were doing, he did that, I think, because you all are in a political sphere as it relates to this G-20, and you each need to influence each other. But, Mr. Tarullo, was he successful in sort of getting that mantra going, a principles-based focus? Or as you all left Pittsburgh the other day, were there still countries looking at an actual amount, a nominal cap on compensation?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, a little bit of history here may be useful. In the spring, the Financial Stability Board came out with its set of principles on incentive compensation, and we, meaning the United States, but specifically the staff from the Federal Reserve, have been very closely involved in the articulation of those principles. At that time, we began internally our process of thinking about how we would want to give guidance to the institutions we supervise to implement those principles. And the press reports which people saw a couple of weeks ago reflected, more or less accurately, the direction in which we are headed. The Board has not actually voted on the guidance yet, but it reflected accurately the direction in which we are headed. And that direction is one which, as you say, emphasizes that there is not a single formula that is sensible for all kinds of employees who have the capacity to assume a lot of risk for their enterprises in a variety of different companies. So our approach, I think, has been to want a rigorous internal process in firms in which the onus is on them to develop the right kinds of compensation contracts and provisions, taking into account their particular business and the kinds of responsibilities their employees have, but that those specific policies and practices need to be consistent with the overall goals of risk-appropriate incentive-based compensation. We worked on that and continue to work on it, but we worked on it through the spring and the summer, knowing what kinds of discussions were going on internationally as well. I think that our view has been that the direction in which we are going is completely consistent with the FSB principles of last spring, and I think if you look at the final FSB report which was referenced by the leaders this fall, that there was not a mandating of particular formulas applicable to all employees. It is, once again, an emphasis on the goals to be served, and I think you will see that our guidance, when it does come out, will be consistent with those principles.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","The resolution mechanism--I know that our distinguished Ranking Member brought it up a minute ago--many of us--and, thankfully, Paul Volcker has been vocal lately and talked about the ``too big to fail'' category just should not exist. And I know that, you know, there have been discussions about whether there was or was not a mechanism in place when we started all of the things with did with TARP because maybe there was not an orderly way to resolve a highly complex bank holding company. So I know the administration has put forth a proposal that I think is exactly the wrong direction to go, but the fact is there is gaining momentum, I think, around actually having a resolution mechanism that says when an institution fails, it actually fails, and there is a process through which they go. They are not conserved and new life breathed into them with taxpayer money. If that type of solution prevails--and I hope that it does--what does that do as it relates to the international systems and the fact that there are different laws in different countries? You know, we may have a large entity here that obviously has subsidiaries all around the world. Talk to us about some of the complexities that might exist if that type of mechanism were put in place.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Senator, I think that you will have complexities with or without the mechanism, but they will be of a somewhat different sort, and my instinct would be that the complexities with the mechanism in place here will be more manageable than under the status quo.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Where they actually go out of business?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","No, it is not that so much. It is just that the way I have thought about this is we really need a third alternative, somewhere between bailout and bankruptcy--or an uncontrolled bankruptcy, I should put it, a ``disorderly bankruptcy,'' as it is called. And that, it seems to me, should be the starting point for thinking about a resolution mechanism. Now, with respect to the complexities, for the reasons I indicated earlier, there is not going to be--and Senator Shelby's intermediate question I think emphasized that--an international treaty that says everybody has the same resolution mechanism, certainly not anytime in the foreseeable future. So there will be some potential discontinuities between the systems in each country. But I think a resolution mechanism can provide tools to each national government that could allow a more orderly or less disorderly resolution of a failed institution. For example, it may permit the creation of a bridge bank. It may create the possibility for dividing into a good bank or a bad bank, where right now you do not really have the legal capacity to do that. In your words, there will be complications and complexities because the rules may still be somewhat different elsewhere, and there may be assets located in other countries that you are not sure can be subject to the same legal treatment. But I think it gets you at least a step down the road. And, again, keeping in mind that the domestic or overarching purpose, this ought to be as an element of a broad- based response to the problems of moral hazard and too big to fail. So we need multiple instruments, I think, to contain moral hazard, and that means that a resolution mechanism should be moving us toward more market discipline, not less market discipline.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","Any comments by the other witnesses?","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","A very complete answer. I will say--and I know this is the end of my time here. I can tell by the body language of our Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Take your time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Corker","But the procyclical issue, it sounded to me that the answers, which I very much appreciate were thoughtful, really do not come to a conclusion; that as you try to avoid, you know, an unnecessary steaming up of the economy, there are issues there as to what is happening right now. I mean, I think we are unnecessarily driving it into the ground. We talk about Main Street all the time. I do not even like that kind of terminology, and I cannot believe I let it come out of my mouth, where you separate the two because it is all intertwined. But the fact is that at local levels around our country today, there is no question that banks are doing things that are not in their best interest, and they are being driven there by regulators and a herd mentality. I mean, they are doing things that happen every time these cycles occur. There are absolutely ignorant things that are being done. They are hurting shareholder value. They are hurting their communities. And it is being driven by regulators who--you know, it is kind of like you yell ``Fire'' and everybody leaves. You yell ``commercial real estate'' or you yell some kind of--and everybody--it is the same exact thing that happens in every cycle. And yet I have not heard a response--I am not criticizing you. I have not heard a response as to how to deal with that other than maybe the regulators acting sensibly. But I do not know how you put that in a formula, if you will, and then try to cause that to occur. And that is just one example. There are all kinds of procyclical issues, I understand. But I think that is going to be maybe the most important thing that occurs. I mean, the whole issue is to keep us from having a systemic failure, and so you have to sort of work on those procyclical things, which are tough to do when times are good. But, anyway, I have taken too long. I thank each of you for your testimony. And when you figure that out, if you would send us a memo, we would appreciate it.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you very much, Senator Corker.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","I would like to ask the Governor a question, picking up on what Senator Corker is talking about, and that is, resolution authority. We have got this ``too big to fail'' mentality, and maybe it is more than that, which a lot of people disagree with, and the majority of the American people definitely disagree with. But we have got it in Europe, too, and so forth. But there has to be an end to something sooner or later, and if we do not have some type of legislation with something definite for the regulators, whoever the systemic regulator comes up to be, where if something does get so bad you need to close it up, you need to sell it off, that you do it. What is bothering me is Citicorp has had all this money pumped into it. We have 36 percent of the stock, more or less, I guess. There is no resolution to that a year later. AIG, I do not know if we are getting our arms around--I hear we are getting our arms around them. There are going to have to be some long arms, some big arms to get your arms around that. But what is going to be the ultimate resolution of that? How long is it going to take, too, all of these things? Because as I look at a regulator that is going to wind down something, I think--and oftentimes, FDIC, you have got to give them credit for one thing. They can wind down an institution, sometimes faster than a lot of people would want. But they can wind it down. But can the Fed wind them down? Questionable.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Well, Senator, the Federal Reserve is certainly not interested in being a receiver or conservator of any institutions. Let me say a couple of things. One, the complexity of the larger institutions is going to be a challenge, and I think we all just have to acknowledge that. The FDIC does a terrific job of winding down institutions, but if we look at the profile of those institutions, they are overwhelmingly fairly straightforward banking institutions. Second, I think that as we approach the resolution issue, as I said to Senator Corker a moment ago, we do have to make sure that we are increasing market discipline, and usually what that means is--forgive me for the vernacular--but guys are going to take some losses. And unless that is pretty clear, then you are going to lose the advantages of market discipline along the way. But the third thing I will say is--and I have said this before in this hearing and other hearings--I am not sanguine that any one tool is going to be adequate to contain systemic risk and, more importantly, in a direct regulatory sense to deal with the moral hazard and too big to fail problems. That is why I think that we should regard a resolution mechanism as one element, necessarily imperfect but I hope positive, along that road.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","We are always going to have in a market system winners and losers, failures and success, and that is the genius of the market in a sense. And you are going to have failures in banks ahead down the road. But do you believe as a regulator that you would have some responsibility to make sure that these banks are well capitalized and that are not into something that you--in other words, you do not let the banks run ahead of you and jeopardize themselves and ultimately the taxpayers in some way?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Absolutely, Senator. I think capital is one of the key instruments to which I was referring earlier.","Speech"," "
"Senator Shelby","OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Senator Shelby. I just had two quick questions, Governor Tarullo, for you, following up on my colleagues' very good questions. You outlined a number of sensible steps--you referred to them as ``practical steps''--that could be taken with regard to the whole resolution issue. Are any of those being pursued by the FSB or by other entities or in other forums? What is the prospect of some of those actually being implemented?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","A couple of things, Senator. This is one of those areas where there are a couple of different committees internationally at work on these issues. The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, I think yesterday, but certainly very recently, released a set of recommendations on cross-border resolution which included some recommendations I would say are congruent with what I just stated a moment ago, and now there is going to be a follow-up process to see if we can move internationally along that path. I am quite certain that with respect to the supervisory colleges and information issue that I mentioned, I think that will move forward. With respect to the contingency planning, I think that will move forward, too. The issue of an appropriate resolution mechanism is something--by the way we operate in democracies--our congresses and parliaments are ultimately going to decide. The standardization of contracts----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","If I could interrupt for just a second, Governor, so these recommendations were made to whom?","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","To members of the Basel Committee----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","These are just best practices basically made to the different countries that comprise the----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","And that really launches the process by which people then go home and say, OK, now how are we going to----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","So now it is up to all of us, basically, to act on these recommendations.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Tarullo","Correct, Senator. Correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Very good. My last question is for you, Mr. Sobel, and Ms. Casey, I hope you are not insulted I didn't have a question for you today. I found your testimony to be quite excellent, however. I briefly mentioned, then we got off into a different aspect of a question earlier, the role of the IMF, Mr. Sobel. What is the status of thinking on that, the FSB or----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","The role of the IMF with the FSB?","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Well, what role they might play ultimately in overseeing the recommendations that are--the FSB and the other recommendations that are made.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","So the----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","I know they were searching for a mission. With the recent crisis, they have been resuscitated. God willing, that is a temporary state of affairs. So I am just wondering what role they might play in all this at the end of the day.","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","Well, I think the IMF has a very important role to play in promoting global financial stability. The FSB brings together national regulators, supervisors, Treasury officials with standard setters. The IMF attends the meetings. Sometimes the way I think about it is a bit simplistic, but there is kind of a micro focus on what are you doing in any given institution. But I think one of the things we have learned from the crisis is we need a macro focus to understand what are the macroeconomic phenomena and dimensions that interact with the performance of the institutions. If you just look at one individual firm, but you don't see what is happening across firms, you can miss some----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Well, that is a role the IMF could----","Speech"," "
"Mr. Sobel","Yes, and that is where I see--I think the Fund can play an important role in providing kind of a macro approach to vulnerabilities and building up in the system early warning, perhaps. The Global Financial Stability Report is, I think, a high-quality product. It provides a lot of insights into what is happening in financial markets. And, of course, the IMF also works with countries, first of all, through the Financial Sector Assessment Programs, but also through technical assistance to strengthen banking systems.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Very well. Well, again, thank you all for your time. A lot of good progress has been made. A lot of good work has been done, but this is still very much a work in progress. And so perhaps a year from now, I think it might be appropriate to reconvene and to see how much of a consensus has actually been achieved, what continuing disparities exist with regard to individual countries following up on that consensus, and where any opportunities for--where any leaks in the system might continue. So again, I want to thank all of you. I realize how busy you are. I really appreciate it. Keep up the good work. Thank you. The Subcommittee hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
