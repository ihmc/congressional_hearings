"Chairman Watt","Unfortunately, we have been notified that we will have a series of votes, four or five votes pretty soon, so we are going to try to get as far as we can into the process. I am going to go ahead and get started. Let me call this hearing of the Subcommittee on Domestic Monetary Policy and Technology to order. Without objection, all members' opening statements will be made a part of the record, and I will recognize myself for an opening statement, which I will try to get in before we get called for votes, and maybe we can get the opening statements in before we get the call to the Floor. This hearing is entitled, ``Regulatory Restructuring: Balancing the Independence of the Federal Reserve in Monetary Policy With Systemic Risk Regulation.'' Our current regulatory system, created largely as a response to the Great Depression in the 1930's, has proven ineffective and outdated at preventing and addressing the financial crisis we are currently experiencing. Recognizing this, the President recently put forth a proposal for comprehensive financial regulatory reform. This hearing will examine one aspect of that proposal, the part that proposes to delegate to the Federal Reserve Board new powers, including the power to serve as the systemic risk regulator for all large, interconnected financial firms. As the systemic risk regulator, the Federal Reserve would be empowered to structure and implement a more robust supervisory regime for firms with a combination of size, leverage, and interconnectedness that could pose a threat to financial stability. This hearing will examine whether and how the Fed could perform and balance the proposed new authority as systemic risk regulator with its current critical role as the independent authority on monetary policy. While recent events have caused many to reevaluate and question the role and the extent of independence accorded to the Federal Reserve, the Fed's independence from political influence by the Legislative and Executive Branches of Government has long been viewed as necessary to allow the Fed to meet the long-term monetary policy goals of low inflation, price stability, maximum sustainable employment, and economic growth. Most central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve, the Bank of England, the Bank of Japan, and the European Central Bank, have had a strong tradition of independence in executing monetary policy. Many scholars and commentators agree that an independent central bank that is free from short-term political influence and exhibits the indicia of independence, such as staggered terms for board members, exemption from the appropriations process, and no requirement to directly underwrite government debt, can better execute the long-term goals of monetary policy. The important question that our hearing today is focused upon is whether the Fed can maintain its current role as the independent authority on monetary policy, and take on a new role, a significantly new role, as the systemic risk regulator. Some scholars and commentators argue that the Fed is uniquely positioned to become the systemic regulator because it already supervises bank holding companies, and through its monetary policy function, helps manage microeconomic policy. Others argue that the Fed is already stretched too thin, and has strayed from its core monetary policy function, particularly by using its powers under section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act to purchase securities in distressed industries under existing emergency circumstances. As Congress and the President work to enact financial regulatory reform, it is critical for us to examine carefully the extent to which proposed new rules may conflict with existing roles and whether the Fed can effectively juggle all of these roles while performing its vital function as the Nation's independent authority on monetary policy. For our economy to function effectively, the Fed's monetary activities, such as open market operations, discount window lending, and setting bank reserve requirements must be independent and free from political influence. We need to get a clear handle on the extent to which the Administration's proposals could compromise or interfere with what the Fed already is charged to do. I look forward to learning more about how and whether the Fed can effectively carry out additional regulatory responsibilities while maintaining its current role as the independent authority on monetary policy. I now recognize the ranking member of the full committee for 4 minutes, Mr. Bachus from Alabama."
"Mr. Bachus","I thank the chairman. Mr. Chairman, I don't think there is anything that is in such sharp contrast as the Administration's proposal for the Fed's role and that of the Republicans in the House. We particularly object to what we see is allowing the Fed to become a permanent bailout agency. We believe that is most troubling, and we believe if that is allowed to happen, they will sacrifice their independence. It is absolutely impossible to make them an independent agency and allow them to function as they are and yet give them the opportunity to guarantee or loan billions of dollars without substantially increasing their accountability and transparency. But I do thank you for holding this hearing. Whether regulatory power and sweeping new powers really should be centralized and given to the Federal Reserve at a time when our country is facing unprecedented fiscal, economic, and monetary policy challenges, we believe, is very problematic. We have some foremost experts, Governor Kohn and our second panel, so we look forward to the testimony. During the past 2 years, we watched as the Federal Reserve has responded to dislocations in the financial markets with far-reaching interventions in virtually every corner of our economy. To confront the crisis, the Fed has used its emergency authority to bail out failing institutions--we believe, particularly with AIG and others, but particularly with AIG and with some of the auto companies, this was unwise--to provide loans and loan guarantees; to revive the credit markets, which I think has had success; and lowering the target Fed funds rate almost to zero; and more than doubling its balance sheet. Regardless of how one views these extraordinary Fed actions, I think we all agree that as we go forward, we do need a more transparent institution with a more clearly defined role. Republicans believe that the Fed's core mission--and I stress this--is to conduct monetary policy and that mission will be seriously undermined if its supervisory responsibilities are dramatically expanded, as proposed in the Obama Administration's White Paper. Indeed, the proper role of the Fed represents, as I said, the critical difference between the Administration's proposal, which would statutorily bless what we consider an unwise cycle of bailouts, picking winners and losers, and obligating the taxpayers from our plan, which does none of those things. The Administration would reward past regulatory and monetary policy mistakes by giving the Fed the preeminent role in regulating the financial system and determining which financial institutions are ``too big to fail.'' This stretches the Fed's resources; I think we all agree on that. It complicates its ability to carry out monetary policy functions at a time when our country faces crippling--well, let me say this: I believe if we continue to do these things, continue to have stimulus packages and deficits, we are going to have crippling inflation. And I think the Fed will have its hands full dealing with inflationary pressures without being distracted and overextended by these new powers. The Republican plan would therefore relieve the Fed of some of its current regulatory responsibilities and allow it to focus on monetary policy missions. So thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. But most importantly, I am going to close by saying we need to end the bailouts in which the Fed has been instrumental, I think, in carrying out over the last 18 months, and I mean the ad hoc bailouts of individual institutions. Thank you."
"Chairman Watt","The ranking member of the subcommittee, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Paul, is recognized for 4 minutes."
"Dr. Paul","Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And welcome, Chairman Kohn. I am delighted you are holding this hearing today because it deals with a subject that I have talked about for many years, and--we have had earlier discussions, and the Fed's position, of course, is that they do reveal a lot of information. And even in the testimony that we will hear today, they still argue their case for exceptions, the argument being that they don't want the independence of the Fed threatened and they don't want it to be politicized. Well, a lot of us think of independence--we put another word in there automatically, that means ``secret'' and ``clandestine'' and ``serving special interests.'' It is a nice word--independence. But politicize, there is no goal, I don't have a goal of making it political other than the fact that the whole system deserves political attention, and yet it gets so little attention; it has not had much attention over these many, many years. But there is good evidence that it has been politicized already. There have been journal articles written and books written about how the Fed has been influenced by the Presidents over time, and that when a reappointment time was coming up, policies were designed to serve certain Administrations. And so I would say that to argue the case that it should never be politicized is, you know, an argument against what we have, because it has been known to be politicized. One other point I want to strongly make is, the bill that I have offered, H.R. 1207, has been challenged at times, and I think it is justified to at least question; and that is, how much would my bill affect monetary policy? And it doesn't. It doesn't affect it in any way whatsoever. We are not looking for the Congress to run monetary policy. We just want to know what is going on and why and the discussions. Why wait 5 years to hear the debate? There is a strong argument made that the sooner the markets know what you are thinking and what you are doing and what the plans are, the better off you are. When I first came to Congress, we weren't even allowed to know what the targets were going to be, and the markets-- immediately after the meetings, they agitated, what are they doing? They figured it out, and all of a sudden they started announcing it. It wasn't the end of the world, yet they argued, well, no, you are not allowed to know. There is a strong argument now that the more we know about what has been going on in this last year, the more it would have helped the markets. It is the unknown. And that is why we need a much more open Fed. And the people are demanding it. They want transparency. ``Transparency'' is a good word, but to say that a little bit of transparency is good, but we can't have a lot of it, there are certain things we don't want you to know--what we are doing when we are talking to foreign central banks, foreign governments, international organizations; what kind of agreements do we have with the IMF? We have an obligation, a moral obligation, here in the Congress to know exactly what the agreements are. And we are not doing this to preempt anything. This is the reason why the support for this bill that I have is now up to 255, and it is across-the-board--liberals, conservatives, progressives, populists, libertarians, they are supporting this because--and there is no agreement among those groups of what monetary policy ought to be. They don't want to make it a political football. They are not asking for Congress to participate in FOMC meetings, but to know what the strategy is and what the plans are. That is legitimate information, and we shouldn't be afraid of it. We shouldn't be afraid of the truth. There have been arguments over the years made about transparency. And I can give quotes--and may later--quotes from Alan Greenspan, how important. And when you look at those quotes generically, they are very, very good. But when it comes down to the bottom line, they say, well, we want you to know what is going on on the unimportant things, but when it comes to the important things, we want secrecy. I yield back."
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his opening statement. The gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, is recognized for 1 minute."
"Mr. Castle","Well, thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have sort of enjoyed these opening statements because I happen to agree with all sides and all positions being taken by everybody. And let me just say, Mr. Watt, that I agree with you. I think you have asked the basic, right question that a lot of us are concerned about, and that is, can the Federal Reserve maintain its role in shaping monetary policy at the same time that it is expanding itself is to cover systemic risk in this country? I think that is a very serious question that needs to be answered, and I certainly couldn't answer it now. I don't know if we can get that answer today, but we need to continue to work on that. But I would add another element to that, and that is all the bailouts, whatever you want to call them, that have been going on beyond just the monetary policy issue under Section 13(3). I mean, there is a lot of money that the Fed, without any constrictions from the Congress, has been putting forth to help these various entities. And I am not necessarily being critical of that, but I am very concerned about the role of the Fed and how it has expanded. I happen to agree with Mr. Paul. Mr. Paul and I don't always agree, but I happen to agree with him with respect to his legislation and with the idea that we do need more transparency from the Fed. I think that would help a lot of us in terms of understanding and perhaps embracing some of this. I think his legislation, which I believe is H.R. 1207, is actually very positive legislation. I think it is interesting to see the number of cosponsors that he has. I think a lot of other people feel that perhaps the time has come for the Federal Reserve to be more transparent in terms of what it is doing. But I think we need a clear, coherent vision of exactly why the Federal Reserve would be the right choice if we are going to have a systemic risk regulator, which I happen to believe in conceptually. But I am not 100 percent sure that the President and others who advocate this have targeted the right source to do it, and hopefully we can start to work that out today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back."
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his opening statement. The rules provide for 10 minutes per side for opening statements. The Republican side has 1 more minute, so I am going to yield it to Mr. Paul."
"Dr. Paul","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I probably won't use the entire minute, but it gives me my opportunity to quote Alan Greenspan. In a speech in 1996, Alan Greenspan was addressing this subject, and he said, ``If we are to maintain the confidence of the American people, it is vitally important that the Fed must be as transparent as any agency of government. It cannot be acceptable in a democratic society that a group of unelected individuals are vested with important responsibilities without being open to full public scrutiny and accountability.'' And I know those terms are general, and he probably might disagree with a little bit of my bill, but those are good words. And I am just carrying through on that because I think it is so important for the American people to know. I mean, the protectors of the value of our currency are all powerful, and we need to know everything conceivable about how that policy is designed. We don't want to set the policy, but what we want to know is how it has been done and whose interests are being served."
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his opening statement. I thank all parties for their opening statements. Mr. Perlmutter is here. He is not a member of the subcommittee. We welcome him. I haven't recognized him for an opening statement, but we are going to proceed without recognizing him for an opening statement. We are delighted today to have on the first panel the only witness, Mr. Donald Kohn, the Vice Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve. Without objection, Vice Chairman Kohn, your written statement will be made a part of the record, and you will be recognized for 5 minutes to summarize your testimony. I now recognize you for your statement. "
"STATEMENT OF DONALD L. KOHN, VICE CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"," "
"Mr. Kohn","Thank you, Chairman Watt, Ranking Member Paul, and members of the subcommittee. I do appreciate this opportunity to discuss with you the important public policy issues associated with the Congress' grant to the Federal Reserve of a substantial degree of independence in the conduct of monetary policy and the interaction of this degree of independence with the possible enhancement of our responsibilities for financial stability. A well-designed framework for monetary policy includes a careful balance between independence and accountability. In 1977, the Congress amended the Federal Reserve Act by establishing maximum employment and price stability as our monetary policy objectives. At the same time, the Congress has correctly, in my view, given the Federal Reserve considerable scope to design and implement the best approaches to achieving those statutory objectives, subject to a well-calibrated system of checks and balances in the form of transparency and accountability to the public and the Congress. Considerable experience shows that this approach tends to yield a monetary policy that best promotes economic growth and price stability. Operational independence, that is, independence to pursue legislative goals, reduces the odds on two types of policy errors that result in inflation and economic instability. First, it prevents governments from succumbing to the temptation to use the central bank to fund budget deficits; and second, it enables policymakers to look beyond the short term as they weigh the effects of their monetary policy actions on price stability and employment. The current financial crisis has clearly demonstrated the need for the United States to have a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to containing systemic risk. The Administration recently released a proposal for strengthening the financial system that would provide new or enhanced responsibilities to a number of Federal agencies, assigning to the Federal Reserve certain new responsibilities for overseeing systemically important financial institutions and payment clearing and settlement arrangements. These incremental new responsibilities are a natural outgrowth of the Federal Reserve's existing supervisory and regulatory responsibilities. The Federal Reserve already regulates bank holding companies, which now include large investment banks, and we have been moving to incorporate a more macroprudential approach to our supervision and regulatory programs, as evidenced by the recently completed Supervisory Capital Assessment Program. The Federal Reserve has also long been a leader in the development of strong international risk management standards for payment clearing and settlement systems, and we have implemented these standards for the systems we supervise. In our supervision of bank holding companies, and our oversight of some payment systems, we already work closely with other Federal and State agencies. These responsibilities and close working relationships have not impinged on our monetary policy independence, and we do not believe that the enhancements to our existing supervisory and regulatory authority proposed by the Administration would undermine our ability to pursue our monetary policy objectives effectively and independently. Our independence in the conduct of monetary policy is accompanied by substantial accountability and transparency. For instance, the Federal Reserve reports on its efforts to achieve its statutory objectives in the semiannual monetary reports and associated testimony. The Federal Open Market Committee releases a statement immediately after each regularly scheduled meeting and detailed minutes of the meeting on a timely basis. We publish summaries of the economic forecasts of FOMC participants 4 times a year, and Federal Reserve officials frequently testify before the Congress. In addition, the Federal Reserve provides the public and the Congress with detailed annual reports on the consolidated financial activities of the system. These are audited by an independent public accounting firm. We publish a detailed balance sheet on a weekly basis. This year, we expanded our Web site to include considerable background information on our financial condition and our policy programs. We recently initiated a monthly report to Congress on Federal Reserve liquidity programs that provides even more information on our lending, associated collateral, and other facets of the programs established to address the financial crisis. The Congress also recently clarified the GAO's ability to audit the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, a joint Treasury-Federal Reserve initiative, and it granted the GAO new authority to conduct audits of the credit facilities extended by the Federal Reserve to single and specific companies under the authority provided by Section 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act. As this committee is aware, the Federal Reserve is already subject to frequent audits by the GAO on a broad range of our functions, including, for example, supervision and regulatory functions. The Congress, however, has purposefully and for good reason excluded monetary policy deliberations and operations from the scope of potential GAO audits. The Federal Reserve strongly believes that removing the statutory limits on GAO audits of monetary policy matters would be contrary to the public interest. Financial markets likely would see the grant of such authority as tending to undermine monetary independence, and this would have adverse consequences for interest rates and economic stability. An additional concern is that permitting GAO audits of the broad facilities the Federal Reserve uses to affect credit conditions could reduce the effectiveness of these facilities in helping promote financial stability, maximum employment, and price stability. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for inviting me to present the Board's views, and I look forward to answering your questions. [The prepared statement of Vice Chairman Kohn can be found on page 57 of the appendix.]"
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his testimony. The bad news is that we just got called for at least five votes on the Floor of the House. The good news is that once we get through this series of votes, we will probably be able to proceed uninterrupted through the balance of this witness and the next panel, we hope, although it is a little dicey on the Floor today. So I would at this point declare the subcommittee in recess, subject to the call of the Chair, and encourage the members to please return promptly after the last vote on the Floor in this series of votes. I hate to inconvenience all of the witnesses, but I guess you all have been through this before, so you know how it works. The committee stands in recess. "
"Chairman Watt","We will reconvene now. I will recognize myself for 5 minutes to ask Mr. Kohn questions. I am interested in getting a better understanding of what your view is of what specific things a systemic risk regulator does, so let me start there--or would do, I guess, to make it a theoretical question as opposed to a--"
"Mr. Kohn","Chairman Bernanke has made a useful distinction between microprudential regulation and macroprudential regulation. And microprudential regulation is looking at each individual institution and making sure they are robust and resilient and safe. In a macroprudential context, you want to look at not only the individual institutions, but how they relate to each other and how they relate to the system as a whole. And sometimes it is not so much the size of the institution, but its interconnectedness--whether it is at the center of a web of relationships which, if disrupted, would have knock-on domino effects. So I think the job of the systemic risk regulator would be to take account of those interrelationships--the markets and how they are developing, and the institutions and how they fit into the markets--and look at the overall risk to the system as well as the risk of the individual institution, how that fits in. And I think the Federal Reserve is well positioned to play a role in that. We have not only our supervisory authority over bank holding companies, which now include all the major investment banks, but we have staff who are familiar with markets, the macro economy, and have responsibility for financial stability of the system through our lender-of-last- resort facilities. So I think it requires a little bit of a different perspective than we are used to exercising. And I think the Fed's in good position to do that."
"Chairman Watt","Not unexpectedly, you focused on the synergies that exist between the two responsibilities. Let me ask you if you could candidly focus on the prospects or possibilities of conflicts. What are the areas in which those possibilities of conflicts might arise?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think there are minimal possibilities. I think some people have asked whether, if we see a systemic risk from the individual institution, that would affect our monetary policy deliberations. But in my view, I think there really is a congruence between the stability of the financial system and monetary policy. We can achieve our objectives of maximum employment and stable prices much more readily in a stable financial system. So I just don't see important instances in which there would be conflicts."
"Chairman Watt","What kind of staff would you anticipate would be necessary, additional staff would be necessary, to perform the systemic risk regulatory function versus what you are already doing?"
"Mr. Kohn","Recalling that in our view, the systemic risk regulatory function that the Treasury has suggested for us is an incremental change to what we are doing now, it is not a big change, because we already have the systemically important institutions under our authority. I think it would require some more staffing, both on the side of the economists and the side of the supervisors, to evaluate systemic risk in a more systematic way, but I don't think this is a major change in our responsibilities that would require a substantial increase in what we are doing. Now, we have had to staff-up over the last year because we have several large investment banks, for example, that are now bank holding companies, and we have had to change and adapt to our new responsibilities. And we are doing that."
"Chairman Watt","My time is about to expire. Actually, it just did. But let me just squeeze in, because one comment you just made raised somewhat of an interesting question, because I had understood that a lot of the jurisdiction that you would be assuming for systemic risk regulation is not in existing entities that you already regulate. You said that you have all of these systemic risk regulators already under your supervision. Is that, in fact, the case?"
"Mr. Kohn","I don't know that we have all of them, Mr. Chairman. I think that would be something that in consultation with this council--remember that the Treasury is setting up a council of regulators to look at the systemic implications of the markets and the institutions. We would consult with them as to whether they saw some institutions that weren't currently under our purview that were systemic. But at this point, I think that would be very, very few institutions."
"Chairman Watt","I thank you. My time has expired. And I will recognize the gentleman from Texas for 5 minutes."
"Dr. Paul","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Sometimes definitions of words are pretty important, and I alluded to that in my opening statement, about what ``independent'' might mean to others. For me, independent usually is a code word for ``secret,'' so we can't get the information. But one of your arguments for the independence of the Fed or the secrecy of the Fed is that those central banks that do have independence--and they are less monitored in public, they tend to have lower and more stable rates of interest--but how can you compare that to what we have noticed under the Federal Reserve? You know, I remember when I first started looking at what the Federal Reserve was doing, we had 21 percent interest rates. That sort of got my attention. And today we have interest rates of less than 1 percent. So that is hardly stable. And to me, the real mischief comes not only because they are unstable and they fluctuate radically, but also the mischief it causes because these are artificial. I am a believer that interest rates, like prices, should be set by the marketplace. And control of prices and wages is the most serious abuse you can put onto an economy. And yet this fixing of prices seems to give us this trouble. And even the Secretary of the Treasury now, Mr. Geithner, you know, just a few months ago recognized that during the time he was in the Fed, the Fed kept the interest rates way too low for too long. So how can you defend the Fed's maintaining independence or secrecy in order to maintain stable rates and to even try to achieve a stable economy which--obviously, nobody argues we have a stable economy?"
"Mr. Kohn","So I do not equate independence to secrecy. In fact, I agree with the underlying premise, I think, of your question, which is independence and secrecy in a democratic society are antithetical. And I think the Federal Reserve has been quite transparent and has become much more transparent under Chairman Bernanke about what we are doing and why we are doing it. And I think we can retain our independence and your ability to trust what we are doing only by explaining to you what we are doing and why we are doing it. We have not only the statements, which you mentioned in your opening statement, after every meeting explaining what we did and why we did it, but we also have minutes. You have hearings. There are Monetary Policy Reports. There are other hearings that you hold. So I think there are many, many opportunities for us to explain why we are doing what we are doing. And those opportunities and that transparency is absolutely essential for retaining our independence."
"Dr. Paul","Okay. But I still think we can do better. Like I mentioned early on, there was a time when the Fed did not reveal immediately what their targets were."
"Mr. Kohn","That is right."
"Dr. Paul","Why can't we consider releasing the details, instead of in 5 years, why not in 5 weeks? What is the big deal that you have to have this information? And the other argument you use: It is in the public's interest, that one really baffles me. The public is served by you having more information that we don't have access to unless it is maybe 5 years? It seems like there are other interests; it allows the suspicion to build. Whose interests are you really protecting? Because you say, it is the public's interests, I don't think reassures a lot of people, because all of a sudden we think, well, what are you doing? Are you protecting the bankers' interests? Are you protecting some international--another government, another central bank or what? So I don't see how you can protect the public's interest. It seems like we in the Congress should have the responsibility for protecting the public interest by knowing more about what you are doing."
"Mr. Kohn","Within 3 weeks, Congressman, we release minutes of our meetings, which give detailed explanations of why we did what we did, including the arguments back and forth, the minority opinions if people disagree. I think you are talking about transcripts, which we release after 5 years. I would be very concerned that releasing those transcripts earlier would inhibit debate. I think it is in the public interest that we have an unfettered debate within the Open Market Committee and that we are able to speculate among ourselves--what if we did this, what if we did that, where are things going--that there be no inhibition on the back-and-forth within the Open Market Committee. I have been at the Federal Reserve for several decades now, and in my view, publishing the transcripts themselves has had a somewhat inhibiting effect on the way the debate is carried out. There are many more prepared statements read at Open Market Committee meetings now than before the transcripts were published. Participants would be very worried if their remarks were going to be made public very, very quickly. They would be very worried about what they would say, and they would be much more careful about what they are saying. And that is not in the public interest, provided we are willing to explain to you, as we are, why we did what we did and what the minority views are. And we do do that."
"Dr. Paul","Of course, you know, without an audit we never know. It just seems that it would be of benefit to us to know what the detailed discussion is. Why is there any value? I just don't quite agree with that, because it is really the discussion that we have. Like I made my point in the opening statement, this is after the fact. This is after you have had your meeting; it is after you have done something. And also, the more information the market gets, the better the market operates. And if they know what you are thinking about and what you are planning--you know, 5 years for the minutes is really way too long."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired, but the witness may answer."
"Mr. Kohn","Well, I think we do explain what we are doing and why we are thinking what we are thinking within 3 weeks. And you have ample opportunity to question Chairman Bernanke when he comes up for hearings about why he is doing what he is doing. We would be glad to work with you on how your ideas about how we could be more transparent and more helpful. I agree with you that for the most part transparency, where it doesn't inhibit debate and exchange of ideas, is better for the public. And we have taken huge steps in that direction over the past 3 years."
"Chairman Watt","The other gentleman from Texas, Mr. Green, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Green","When you say, ``the gentleman from Texas'' and don't say which one, many microphones are opened up. Thank you,"
"Mr. Chairman"," I thank the witness for his testimony. And I apologize for not being here to hear you in your entirety in terms of your testimony. There are those who would like to have an independent Fed. Obviously, that has worked well. The autonomy of the Fed has inured to our benefit. And there are those who contend that if the Fed acquires these new powers and remains as independent as it has been, then the Fed becomes this awesome giant that would be beyond the control of Congress, of the Executive and Legislative Branches. How do you respond to those folks who conclude that this is risky, to give the Fed this much power?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think there are two avenues for response, Congressman. One is the additional authority we are getting is incremental to what we already have, so it is not a huge increase in our authority. And the second is, for the authority we already have, we are held accountable. We work closely with other agencies, with the FFIEC, with the other regulatory agencies, on the President's Working Group, with the Treasury. The Government Accountability Office does audit our activities in the supervision and regulation area; they perform many audits like that. So we have been able to do that and be held accountable, work with other Agencies without sacrificing the independence that we need to exercise for monetary policy. So I think we are already doing it, and this wouldn't be that big a change."
"Mr. Green","How would the H.R. 1207 audit differ from the GAO audit?"
"Mr. Kohn","I am not sure. The H.R. 1207 would do what? That is Mr. Paul's?"
"Mr. Green","That is the audit bill that Mr. Paul--"
"Mr. Kohn","As I understand it, and I don't understand it perfectly, but I think it would make everything we do subject to GAO audit. Right now, since 1978, the GAO has been able to audit most of our activities except where they touch monetary policy and our interactions with foreign central banks and foreign authorities. And I think Mr. Paul's bill would remove that exemption, so the GAO would be auditing our monetary policy as well as all the other things we would do. Our concern is that would be perceived as impinging to some extent on our independence to meet the objectives that you have given us for price stability and full employment."
"Mr. Green","And as a final question, how can Congress--if you have an opinion--be of assistance in making this transition if the transition is to take place? Is there something more that we need to do to help you transition to the regulatory reform side?"
"Mr. Kohn","No. I think the hearings that you hold and mutual understanding of what is involved in this, with us and the Treasury and others who want to make this transition, you have every right, and you ought to be asking us, as the chairman did, what additional resources we would need in order to do this, how we would carry this out. So I think a dialogue between the Congress and the Federal Reserve is not only appropriate, but would be very useful to define what this is about."
"Mr. Green","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will yield back."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. Mr. Adler, the gentleman from New Jersey, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Adler","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Vice Chairman, you a moment ago articulated Congress' mandate to the Federal Reserve with respect to maximum employment and to price stability. To what extent, if any, do you think additional responsibility as a systemic risk regulator would in any way distract the Federal Reserve from its 1977 congressional mission?"
"Mr. Kohn","Congressman, I don't think it would distract us at all. I see the two missions, the macroeconomic goals of price stability and maximum employment and systemic stability as being completely congruent. I think the more stable the financial system is, the easier it will be for us to pursue successfully the goals of maximum employment and stable prices. Certainly we have seen a demonstration of that in the last 2 years. The instability in the financial system has resulted in very high unemployment and has made it very difficult for the Federal Reserve to reach our objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. So I don't see a conflict between those types of objectives."
"Mr. Adler","You heard the gentleman a moment ago ask questions about the potential lack of accountability of the Federal Reserve as a sort of private entity, not completely under government control. Others have been concerned there is too much political interference with the Federal Reserve in the carrying out of its mission. I wonder if you could comment about what additional political interference you think the Federal Reserve might encounter if it undertakes this responsibility as a systemic risk regulator."
"Mr. Kohn","I think we can separate our accountability as a systemic risk regulator from our independence in carrying out your goals for monetary policy. So I don't see additional political interference with the objectives that you gave us. We will be accountable as the systemic risk regulator. We will be accountable through the Government Accountability Office. We will be accountable to the Congress. We will be working closely with those other regulators in the financial system. And we have been successfully doing that for years, and this would sort of increase our interactions, but I don't think there should be a risk that giving us this additional authority would impede our monetary policy independence."
"Mr. Adler","Mr. Vice Chairman, I thank you. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. We welcome Mr. Gerlach from Pennsylvania, and recognize him for questions, if he has any."
"Mr. Gerlach","None right now. Thank you."
"Chairman Watt","And we welcome the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, and recognize him for questions, if he has any."
"Mr. Sherman","I do."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Sherman","Mr. Vice Chairman, I think you are aware of 13(3) of the Federal Reserve Act."
"Mr. Kohn","I am."
"Mr. Sherman","It is breathtaking in its scope, but even more breathtaking in the amounts. I have talked to your Chairman. Almost facetiously, I asked him whether a $12 trillion limit on the total exposure under 13(3) would be acceptable to him, and believe it or not, he said yes. Chairman Bernanke has interpreted before this committee 13(3) as allowing the Fed only to take risks that are the equivalent of triple A, that is to say, only to extend the credit of the Federal Reserve under that section where there was the lowest risk that a credit rating agency would evaluate. Do you agree with that constrained view of 13(3) or not?"
"Mr. Kohn","Under section 13(3), the Reserve bank making the loan needs to be secured to its satisfaction. We have insisted on security on every loan that we have made. We have been releasing more and more information about those loans. I think, for the most part, those loans are safe. The credit risks--"
"Mr. Sherman","I am asking you not for your prior practice but for your legal interpretation. Let's say that the Secretary of the Treasury called you in the middle of the night and said, ``By God, we need another $700 billion to shore up institutions on Wall Street. We need to do it right now or the entire world comes to an end; and those idiots in Congress, they won't vote for another TARP. So the only way we are going to save civilization as we know it is for the Fed to take some substantial risks and become a general creditor of banks that would otherwise become insolvent and other financial institutions.'' Do you believe that you or your successors have the legal right to say, ``Yes, Mr. Secretary, we couldn't agree with you more; we will have a vote on it and we will extend the credit?''"
"Mr. Kohn","I think we need a new resolution authority through the Congress."
"Mr. Sherman","I am not asking you what new law should be passed. I am not asking you what your practice has been in the past. I am asking you what are the legal authorities you have under present law right now?"
"Mr. Kohn","We need to be secured. I think one of the issues is--"
"Mr. Sherman","So you can't take a double A risk; you can only take a triple A risk?"
"Mr. Kohn","We need to have enough security that we feel that the loan has good prospects of being repaid, that we are not taking fiscal risk."
"Mr. Sherman","Let's say you were buying paper that if you worked for a credit rating agency, you would rate at single A. Is that the kind of risk that you are legally allowed to take under 13(3)?"
"Mr. Kohn","Only if it is discounted to an extent so that the collateral value would be less than the par value. And that is what we do. We take paper at the discount window that isn't triple A, but we don't give it full par value; we discount it. And I think we protect the public purse in that way."
"Mr. Sherman","It sounds like you have the power to do another TARP almost, but not quite. Shifting to another direction, in a democracy it is supposed to be one person, one vote. Every institution of the government is supposed to reflect the results of elections held in polling booths. Yet you have these--at least your regional Boards of Governors are selected on the basis of--I will call it ``one bank, one vote,'' to oversimplify. Does it make any sense to invest with the image of governmental power, and everybody--I mean, you can say there is a difference between the Fed and the branches of the Fed, although throughout business, ``branch'' means, in effect, another office, not even a separately incorporated subsidiary, so most of the world is going to view your branches as part of your tree. Do you think it is appropriate to have privately elected Governors serve in what appears to everyone to be a governmental capacity?"
"Mr. Kohn","The boards of directors of the Reserve banks have served a valuable function in the Federal Reserve."
"Mr. Sherman","Well, sir, in Germany before World War I, they had what many people thought was a very good government, but your voting power, your control over government agencies depended upon how rich you were. And you can argue it was a very good government that made very good decisions right up until Sarajevo. I am not asking you whether it is good government--whether you have made good decisions. What I am asking is, is it consistent with what we celebrated on the 4th of July to have such governmental power in the hands of those elected on the basis of one bank, one vote?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think Congress, from 1913 on, has considered it consistent with its authorities and how it wished to carry them out."
"Mr. Sherman","That is before we gave you the enormous additional power we are considering."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired."
"Mr. Sherman","I yield back."
"Chairman Watt","And while I would be a lot more generous, we have a little time bind that we are operating in. The gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, is recognized."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kohn, I am concerned about conflicts here. As you deal with the 13(3) bailouts, or whatever you want to call them, and as you deal with monetary policy, and then you, the Fed, would get into the systemic risk regulator issue, do you at least see the potential for--and if you do, could you articulate what it would be--for conflicts of interest in terms of the different responsibilities the Federal Reserve would have if you had all those powers?"
"Mr. Kohn","Congressman, no, I really don't see the potential for major conflicts here. I think we carry out our monetary policy mission much more easily in a systemically sound financial system. We have seen the demonstration of that over the last 2 years, what happens when the system isn't sound. It makes it very, very difficult for us. On the other hand, I don't see us using our monetary policy authority in any way that wouldn't be consistent with the objectives you gave us for macroeconomic stability and price stability. So I really think the two are congruent, not conflicting."
"Mr. Castle","I mean, I interpret from your opening statement, and what you have been saying is that the Board of Governors of the Fed welcome this responsibility--at least you seem to. Is there any conflict at all among the Board or discussion about, should we be doing this or is it better left to an independent agency or some other agency?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think members of the Board have had different views about a broad grant of authority, but--I haven't polled all the members of the Board."
"Mr. Castle","I am not asking you to speak for them, just what you observed."
"Mr. Kohn","I see this as an incremental change from where we are right now, and, therefore, I am not aware of any dissent on the Board about the particular proposal that the Treasury has made. Before the Treasury made the proposal, there was a lot of discussion of some systemic risk regulator with unspecified authorities and unspecified responsibilities. I think there was concern on the Board, which I shared, that it was impossible to carry the responsibilities out because we didn't have the authorities and because the expectations were way too high in terms of what was possible in a market economy that naturally has ups and downs. But I see the proposal on the table as more modest, which is taking what we currently do, but giving a little more macroprudential shape to it, thinking about the implications and being sure that the core institutions, the ones that have caused the problems that have given rise to what you call the ``bailouts,'' are safe and are not subject to the kinds of risks and the kinds of knock-on effects to the rest of the market that have caused us to intervene this time."
"Mr. Castle","How would you interact with other regulatory bodies that have jurisdiction over some of these entities, be it an SEC or whatever it may be? How do you think that would fundamentally work?"
"Mr. Kohn","We would work closely with them. We already do work with the other banking regulators on FFIEC. We would be part of this council that the Treasury has looking at systemic risk and identifying systemic activities, systemic problems. We have close working relationships with the SEC, and I see that continuing. We basically rely on them for supervision of the individual institutions. But I think this would give us some authority to make sure not only that the individual institution is safe, but that the system is safe, too."
"Mr. Castle","What would be your responsibility with large insurers, hedge funds, and even private equity-type funds as you view it if you were to be under this legislation given that responsibility?"
"Mr. Kohn","It would depend upon whether those entities were considered systemically important. And to the extent that they weren't systemically important, we would have no particular authority over them. To the extent that they were, after consulting with the council, which would have the responsibility for identifying these issues, I think if we saw there was a gap in regulation that threatened the stability of the financial system, it would be up to us to try and fill that gap."
"Mr. Castle","I don't know this, but I would assume, because insurance is generally regulated at the State level, that you get into that whole issue of State-Federal. I don't know if you discussed that or not."
"Mr. Kohn","Right. But I think your proposal is to create a Federal entity, isn't it?"
"Mr. Castle","Well, it is being discussed."
"Mr. Kohn","I think the problem perhaps isn't so much the insurance companies; at least thinking back to our very bad experience with AIG, it wasn't the insurance companies, it was the stuff that was going on next to the insurance companies. And I would hope if we saw something like that happening, we would find a way of containing that risk."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman from Minnesota."
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the chairman for calling for this work. Do you believe it is appropriate for the Fed, particularly in light of the systemic risk?"
"Mr. Kohn","I don't think the fact that our power might be expanded is by itself a reason to relinquish the consumer authority. My personal view is that the Federal Reserve is well placed to do a good job in the public interest on consumer regulation. These are congruent, with good consumer regulation, give us a way of balancing issues having to do with consumer regulation. I think in the last years we have stepped up to the plate on high-cost mortgages, on consumer credit. We have revised truth in lending regulations coming out at the end of this month. I would hope that the Congress might think about whether there are ways of strengthening the Federal Reserve's commitment to consumer regulation as an alternative to creating a new regulator."
"Mr. Ellison","Would you allow, Mr. Vice Chairman, that the Fed was slow to the game in addressing some of these consumer issues you just pointed out, particularly in mortgages, credit cards? I mean, some of the issues that the more recent legislation addressed have been longstanding."
"Mr. Kohn","I agree that we did not see the abuses as widespread as they were, and we were slow to react to them. And I think if you kept consumer regulation in the Federal Reserve, if you were to decide to do that, you need to strengthen our commitment to that regulation. I agree."
"Mr. Ellison","Do other central banks around the world have consumer protection as part of their mandate?"
"Mr. Kohn","I don't know."
"Mr. Ellison","Is the Fed currently working on consumer concerns right now with regard to overdraft fees and things like that?"
"Mr. Kohn","I am not sure, Congressman."
"Mr. Ellison","Has the Fed addressed issues like among bank staff that--sort of like sales practices that would push products, push selling accounts, having quotas for selling a certain number of accounts on a given day or a given week without regard to the consumer's best interest? So, for example, if a bank were to say to a personal banker staffer, you must produce 10 new savings accounts today, and then that staffer were to go try to get 2 and 3 accounts from the same person in a day, is that something that the Fed has focused its attention on now?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think our focus in that regard has been transparency, making sure that people knew what they were getting, the terms on what they were getting, and what the alternatives are. I know that we have focused on that in the mortgage area."
"Mr. Ellison","Has the Fed focused on that issue? Particularly now, I mean, overdraft fees are a significant part of bank profit."
"Mr. Kohn","We have focused to some extent in the past. I don't know whether we still are focused on that."
"Mr. Ellison","And if I may be allowed a final question, I agree, I think that some of the work that Fed has done recently has been very laudable, and I want to let you know that I feel that way. Some of the findings you made regarding credits cards and other things are just great. But I will say that given the Fed's mandate of focusing on monetary policy, I wonder--and I wonder if you wouldn't mind commenting--if there are not some occasions in which consumer protection takes a back seat to some of the other issues that the Fed is required to focus on."
"Mr. Kohn","I think that has happened in the past. I don't think it has happened over the past 3 or 4 years."
"Mr. Ellison","I will agree with that."
"Mr. Kohn","And I think there could be changes in our law making consumer protection explicitly a part of our mandate that would help to prevent that from happening in the future. But it has happened in the past, I agree."
"Mr. Ellison","Thank you, Mr. Vice Chairman."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. The gentleman from New Jersey. We welcome Mr. Lance. If the gentleman has questions, we will recognize him for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Good afternoon. Regarding the powers of the Fed at the moment and then this huge debate regarding a systemic regulator, many of us on our side are concerned, Mr. Vice Chairman, with whether or not this should exist, and if it does exist, whether it should exist in the Federal Reserve Board, given your core mission as established, I gather, under Woodrow Wilson in 1913, perhaps. And perhaps you have answered this before I entered the room, and I apologize if you have, but if you could elaborate on your views personally, sir, regarding whether you believe a systemic regulator should be housed in the Fed."
"Mr. Kohn","I think the Federal Reserve is well positioned to carry that mission out in the public interest. I think we bring a variety of perspectives that are important to that. We have everyday contact with the markets, so we know what is going on there. We have supervision, so we have a view of what is happening within individual institutions. Our responsibilities for the macroeconomy give us a perspective on the intersection of financial markets in the macroeconomy. So I do think the Federal Reserve is well positioned to exercise some oversight in the systemic risk area."
"Mr. Lance","Do you believe that there might be an inherent conflict given your responsibilities in managing the macroeconomy?"
"Mr. Kohn","No, I don't. Several of your colleagues have asked that question. I just don't see the conflict. I see this as one of them supporting the other. I think macroeconomic stability will support financial stability, and financial stability will support macroeconomic stability. The Federal Reserve is inevitably involved in financial stability, because we are the lender of last resort and because we have the responsibilities that you gave us for macroeconomic stability. So it doesn't matter in some sense who the financial stability regulator will be. In the end the Federal Reserve will have to be involved. And I think there are synergies for giving the Federal Reserve a little extra power to do that given our current authorities."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you. And in a completely unrelated area, I am personally concerned with the purchase by the Fed recently in an increasing amount of long-term T-bills, and I am not sure the American public is fully aware of this situation. It is obviously arcane and something that may not be on the front pages of newspapers. Could you update us on your recent purchases and where they are in relationship to where they might have been a year ago, sir?"
"Mr. Kohn","In March, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to purchase up to $300 billion of Treasury-- intermediate and long-term Treasury securities. We did that because we thought it would be helpful not for the Treasury per se, but because we thought it would push down interest rates for businesses and households at a time when the economy was falling very rapidly, very weak, and we needed to free up the credit markets so businesses and households would face lower charges and lower cost of capital, and then do some more spending. I am not exactly sure where we are in that process. I think we are about halfway through. We said, I think, it would be done by the end of September. At our last meeting we didn't make any change in that plan."
"Mr. Lance","So if I just might follow up, Mr. Vice Chairman. It is your expectation that you will not continue this beyond the September date, at least to the extent that you are currently involved in that area?"
"Mr. Kohn","We have made no decision on that. That would be a decision the Open Market Committee would have to make."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you. Obviously we on this committee would like to be apprised of that, and that is certainly an area of grave concern to me. Thank you very much, Mr. Vice Chairman. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back the balance of his time. We welcome the member of our full committee, Mr. Garrett, who is not a member of the subcommittee, but I would ask unanimous consent that he be given 3 minutes to ask questions. I would actually ask for longer, but we already displaced a meeting that was scheduled to start in this room at 4:00. There is another meeting that is scheduled to start in this room at 5:00, and we have another panel, but I would happily grant the gentleman 3 minutes, unless one of your members has an objection."
"Mr. Garrett","I appreciate that. And, who knows, they might. But is there anything more important than this meeting and the Chairman that you are leading right now? But thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just a couple of questions. You know, you are familiar with the proposal the Administration has laid out, and I assume that you at least have the opportunity to know that the Minority party, the Republicans, have thrown out a proposal as well to deal with the situation. I don't know whether you have gotten into the weeds of it at all."
"Mr. Kohn","I haven't gotten into the weeds of the Republican alternatives."
"Mr. Garrett","Well, we will be certain to send you an annotated version. One of the provisions in it, in our plan, says, with regard to Section 13--and stop me if someone else threw this question out to you--that 13(3) should be reined in to some extent, the powers under 13(3), and one of the aspects of it to limit the ability for the Fed to actually pick, as it has in the past instance, particular institutions and proverbially bail them out as opposed to--prohibit that, but instead still allow them to use Section 13(3) in a larger, institutional-wide basis, if that is clear."
"Mr. Kohn","Yes."
"Mr. Garrett","Comment?"
"Mr. Kohn","So I think that is consistent, if I understand it correctly, Congressman, with our own position, which is with respect to the resolution of systemically important institutions, we don't want to be involved in making those loans; that there needs to be some way of doing that. We need to have orderly resolution of these institutions, but that is not the job of the Federal Reserve. We would be consulting, we would be part of the process, but it ought to be a Treasury Department-led process."
"Mr. Garrett","But there would be a distinction, though, to simply say that we should set up this wind-down authority as the Administration proposes."
"Mr. Kohn","Right."
"Mr. Garrett","And not putting a limitation on the Fed, Federal Reserve; or, as we are suggesting if it goes through, that you actually have a wind-down authority as you suggest over in the Treasury, so you wind things down, but clearly in statute saying, going forward, Federal Reserve shall not have the authority to do so. Would you concur with that?"
"Mr. Kohn","I would have to see the exact wording. Certainly, I agree with the idea."
"Mr. Garrett","And I know the whole discussions with regard to moral hazard and what has occurred in the past has already been laid out here. One of the things--another issue that is totally unrelated that is in the news is with regard to the Fed Chairman and the allegations or the--with regard to pressure that has been put on certain institutions, what have you, in the past. And they only name specific institutions in those allegations, right? We are sending a letter to the White House just to try to get some more information on that, and so I will just throw the question to you right now. Are you familiar with any other institutions that the Fed or any officials at the Fed have exerted any pressure on in any way, shape, or form, or whether the Treasury has exerted any influence as those allegations are suggesting?"
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. And since that is really a subject that is not within the parameter of this hearing, I wish the gentleman would ask the question in writing, if he wouldn't mind, since we are under some time pressure."
"Mr. Garrett","Can you give me just a yes or no?"
"Mr. Kohn","I would have to see the question in writing. We supervise lots of institutions, and in the process of supervising those institutions, we make lots of requests to them to change their practices. So I am not sure exactly what you are getting at. So perhaps the chairman's suggestion of a written question would be best."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The gentleman from Alabama, the ranking member of the full committee, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you. Governor, do we have an exit strategy from these ad hoc bailouts of failing institutions?"
"Mr. Kohn","We have an exit strategy from the provision of reserves that we have made, the very high level of reserves that we now have in the system. We believe we have the tools to absorb those reserves, to raise interest rates when the time comes to do so. With respect to the individual institutions, I think each institution, like AIG, for example, is putting in place a business strategy to sell pieces of itself, repay the Federal loans and repay the U.S. taxpayer. So there are strategies being put in place for the individual institutions."
"Mr. Bachus","To me, the Obama Administration proposal actually puts in place a permanent bailout agency, and that is the Federal Reserve. It empowers you to bail out through loans or guarantees failing institutions, does it not?"
"Mr. Kohn","That is not my understanding, Congressman."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay."
"Mr. Kohn","We are in agreement with the Administration that a separate resolution authority for failing systemic institutions needs to be established under the oversight of the Treasury, not the Federal Reserve."
"Mr. Bachus","Would that include--would that be an enhanced bankruptcy proceeding?"
"Mr. Kohn","It would be a substitute for bankruptcy procedure, just as we have today for banks and depository institutions under the FDIC."
"Mr. Bachus","So the Federal Reserve as the systemic regulator would have no right to guarantee or loan money to an individual institution."
"Mr. Kohn","That wasn't the process of failing. That would be the resolution of that institution, like Bear Stearns, AIG, would be the province of the Treasury Department."
"Mr. Bachus","But the Fed over the past year has guaranteed some of the obligations and made loans; has it not? You participated--"
"Mr. Kohn","We have been in a second and third guarantee position for some obligations of Citigroup. Is that what you are referring to?"
"Mr. Bachus","And AIG also."
"Mr. Kohn","And AIG."
"Mr. Bachus","And what is the total obligation to AIG?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think we have about $45 billion of loans outstanding to AIG, plus some special-purpose vehicles that have assets that they have taken over from AIG probably total about $40 billion or $45 billion."
"Mr. Bachus","Do you anticipate or would you be opposed to a provision in any law that we pass to prohibit the Fed or the Treasury from loaning billions of dollars of taxpayer money to these institutions or to guaranteeing their obligations?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think somebody in the government, not the Federal Reserve, needs to have the authority to resolve systemically important institutions in an orderly way so they don't threaten the jobs of Americans."
"Mr. Bachus","I would agree with you that there needs to be an orderly resolution."
"Mr. Kohn","That is right."
"Mr. Bachus","I would not agree with you that that would include taxpayer funding or--you know, either guarantees or loans, in the case of, as you say, Citi and AIG, was in the tens of billions of dollars, actually hundreds of billions of dollars. Do you believe that too big to fail--do you believe in that doctrine? Do you believe in the fairness of that doctrine?"
"Mr. Kohn","I think too big to fail is a very difficult, troublesome issue. I agree with the thrust of your question that we need to deal with. I think there is a terrible moral hazard involved in that. And my thinking is that the Administration proposal, something like the Administration proposal is very helpful in that regard. It has two things. One is that the largest institutions that might be too big to fail face much tougher scrutiny, higher capital, greater liquidity, more robust risk management systems so that they won't fail; and, secondly, that there be a resolution authority that would enable the government to resolve these in an orderly way, that might impose costs on the creditors, but in an orderly way outside of bankruptcy."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. The Chair notes that some members may have additional questions for this witness which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to this witness and to place his responses in the record. We thank Vice Chairman Kohn for his patience and for his responses, and we will excuse this witness and call up the second panel. While the second panel is coming forward, I ask unanimous consent to enter into the record the following statements: The statement of Thomas F. Cooley, professor of economics, Stern School of Business, New York University, dated July 9, 2009; and the statement of the Financial Services Roundtable, dated July 9, 2009. Without objection, it is so ordered. The Chair will now briefly introduce the second panel, without giving them all of their glory in the introductions. We will put the full introductions into the record in the interest of time. But this panel includes Dr. Frederic Mishkin, Alfred Lerner Professor of Banking and Financial Institutions at the Graduate School of Business, Columbia University; Dr. Lawrence Meyer, vice chairman, Microeconomic Advisers; Dr. James K. Galbraith, Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., Chair in Government/Business Relations and professor of government, LBJ School of Public Affairs, University of Texas; Dr. Richard Berner, chief economist at Morgan Stanley; Dr. John B. Taylor, Mary and Robert Raymond Professor of Economics at Stanford University; and Dr. Allan Meltzer, The Allan H. Meltzer University Professor of Political Economy, Tepper School of Business, Carnegie-Mellon University. We welcome each one of you, and we will recognize each of you. Your full statements will, of course, be made a part of the record, and each of you will be recognized for 5 minutes to summarize your statement. And I will start with Dr. Mishkin. "
"STATEMENT OF DR. FREDERIC S. MISHKIN, ALFRED LERNER PROFESSOR OF BANKING AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, GRADUATE SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY"," "
"Mr. Mishkin","It is a great pleasure to be here to discuss what is a very important issue, which is what role the Federal Reserve should have as a systemic risk regulator. I want to boil this down to three questions, even though we were asked four, but I think three that are quite relevant to these issues. And the first question is the essential one, which is, should the Fed be the systemic risk regulator? And I am going to answer yes to that question, and there are four reasons that I take that view. The first is that the Federal Reserve is involved in daily interaction with the market, and in terms of being a systemic risk regulator, that kind of information or that contact is extremely useful. The second is that there is a synergy between thinking about macroeconomic stability and financial stability, and that is, I think, extremely important in terms of performing the appropriate analysis to do systemic risk regulation in the best way possible. The third is that there is a synergy between the actions that are required in terms of promoting macroeconomic stability and financial stability. And so we have seen this, of course, in very major ways during this recent crisis. This involves the role of the Federal Reserve as a so-called lender of last resort, providing liquidity to the financial system to, in fact, make sure that macroeconomic stability is preserved. And, finally, the Federal Reserve is one of the most independent of government agencies. In order to be an effective systemic risk regulator, the kind of independence the Fed has had in the past and has used in the past would be also very helpful in this regard. So when I look at this issue of the Fed being a systemic risk regulator, I think that, from my viewpoint, it really is the appropriate logical choice when we think about the nature of this role. The second issue is should the Fed relinquish some of its other roles if it became the systemic risk regulator? And I think the answer here is yes. In particular, the Treasury plan has suggested that the Federal Reserve no longer be a consumer protection regulator, and I concur with this view. There are three reasons why I think that the Fed should no longer be involved in this activity if, in fact, it is handed these additional responsibilities. The first is that being a consumer protection regulator is not at the core mission of what the Federal Reserve does, where I actually do see macroeconomic stability and financial stability is part of that core mission. The second is that it uses a very different skill set. And so in the context of thinking about the synergies, I do not see them to be nearly as relevant. And the third, I think, is really the most important, which is that consumer protection regulation is very political. Everybody cares about it. In the past I testified on credit cards. Everybody has issues in terms of their dealing with the credit card companies. In that context, the possibility of there being more pressure, political pressure, put on the Federal Reserve system is, in fact, greater. And so again I think that this is another reason why having something that is not in your core mission which is, in fact, something that tends to get more political could be harmful to the independence of the Fed, something that I am going to turn to later. The third question is, are there dangers from the Federal Reserve taking on this role of systemic risk regulator? And I think the answer is yes. There are three dangers that do particularly concern me. I will argue, however, that even though these dangers exist, that the Federal Reserve still should be the risk regulator, systemic risk regulator, and there are steps that the Congress can take to, in fact, ensure that the Federal Reserve can do its job adequately both in terms of monetary policy and in terms of promoting financial stability. So the first danger is that the Federal Reserve might lose its focus on price stability. Clearly there are concerns in the marketplace about this issue about the credibility of the Fed as an inflation fighter and steps that it needs to take in terms of making sure that inflation is not too high. And in this context I have argued elsewhere, both when I was a Governor at the Federal Reserve and also afterwards in op eds, that one way of dealing with this would be to have the Federal Reserve to have an explicit numerical objective in terms of inflation, something that it does not have at the current time. The second issue is, could systemic risk regulation interfere with the independence of the Fed? And I think there is some danger here. The danger, of course, is that systemic risk regulation, particularly in the context of having to deal with an institution which has to be reined in, could actually mean that there is some pressure put on the Federal Reserve in that context. And so I think that there is some danger here. But, again, I think that the issue here is that the Congress has to be aware that the independence of the Federal Reserve is very much in the national interest. Indeed, this is a very major concern that I have right now, given concerns about the Federal Reserve's independence and people who have been saying the Federal Reserve needs to be reined in, I think it actually is something that can damage the Federal Reserve's ability to maintain price stability and also macroeconomic stability. But, furthermore, I think that there is also an issue that--in that context that we could actually have even problems currently with concerns about Fed's credibility, which is actually something that can raise interest rates, something that I think has indeed happened. The third issue is something that is not really discussed as much as I would like to see discussed, which is the Federal Reserve's resources have been stretched to the limit by this crisis. And this is particularly true of the Board of Governors. I saw this as a member of the Board of Governors where the staff was working extremely long hours and was exhausted. And I left in September of 2008, before the crisis really got bad. So there are issues in terms of the Fed having enough resources and the support of the Congress for the Fed to acquire the resources that it needs. And I think, again, that is something that is quite important. So the bottom line here for me is that one of the important lessons from this crisis is that we absolutely desperately need a systemic risk regulator. And then I look at the issue about who can do that the best, and my view is that the Federal Reserve is, in fact, best positioned to do so. On the other hand, there are some dangers here, but this is why I think the Congress needs to, in fact, support the Federal Reserve in its independence in terms of the resources that it needs to do this job. And as a result, I think that we would be better served having the Fed pursue this role. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Mishkin can be found on page 83 of the appendix.]"

"STATEMENT OF DR. LAURENCE H. MEYER, VICE CHAIRMAN, MACROECONOMIC ADVISERS"," "
"Mr. Meyer","Thank you very much. And thank you for giving me this opportunity to testify before you this afternoon. The independence of central banks with respect to monetary policy is absolutely essential. Policies that are focused on financial stability, on the other hand, require a more cooperative approach, including, in the United States, the central bank, functional regulators of banks and nonbank subsidiaries, and a clear role for the Treasury. But there needs to be a bright line between the more cooperative approach to financial stability policy and the independence of the Fed with respect to monetary policy. Supervising systemically important financial institutions is, of course, a central part of financial stability policy. I don't believe there is a conflict between the current or newly proposed role for the Fed as systemic risk regulator and the traditional role as independent authority on monetary policy. But then, again, I do not see the Treasury proposal as conferring on the Fed vast new authority as systemic risk regulator. The Fed is already bank holding company or consolidated supervisor for all financial institutions that have a bank. Of the systemically important financial institutions today, most are already bank holding companies. Other institutions that might be designated systemically important could be a couple of insurance companies, a few other large financial firms that are not supervised today, and, in principle but not likely in practice initially, very large and highly leveraged hedge funds. It also should be recognized that there are functional supervisors of the bank and the investment banking and insurance subsidiaries of bank holding companies, and they do much of the heavy lifting in overseeing the risks in their respective parts of the bank holding company. There has always been a debate about whether the Fed's role in bank and bank holding company supervision complements or conflicts with its role in monetary policy. One of the cases for a complementary role is that the Fed's responsibility as hands-on supervisor of some banks and all bank holding companies provides firsthand information about the state of the banking sector, which can be a valuable input into the assessment of the economic outlook, especially in periods of extreme stress like today. The counterargument is that the Fed's concern for the health of the banking system, derived from its role as bank and bank holding company supervisor, can encourage the Fed at times to sacrifice its macro-objectives in order to help the banking system when it is ailing. When I was on the Board, I never witnessed any conflict in practice between these two roles. I don't see why the debate should change as a result of the marginal increase in supervisory reach under the Treasury proposal. A basic premise for my view is that a central bank should always have a hands-on role in bank supervision. First, central banks always have at least an informal responsibility for monitoring systemic risk, and the banking system is a major source of such risk. Second, the central bank is always a source of liquidity to and lending to banks, and must therefore have firsthand knowledge of their creditworthiness, and this is especially true at times of stress. Finally, the central bank will always be called upon to cooperate with Treasury at times of interventions in particular institutions where the Fed will sometimes provide the liquidity, and Treasury should take all the credit risk. Given the Fed's role already as consolidated supervisor of most systemically important financial institutions, the choice may be whether to remove the Fed from its role in banking supervision altogether, or expand its role modestly to cover all systemically important financial institutions. This seems like an obvious choice for me. I also don't see the need to isolate these two functions from each other within the Federal Reserve, at least more than they are today. Now, if the Fed were getting substantial new powers as systemic regulator and had to devote considerable new resources to this new responsibility, then it seems reasonable that it should give up some of its current responsibilities. If something is to be given up, the most obvious choice is consumer protection and community affairs. These are not seen around the world as core responsibilities of central banks. In addition, the case for giving up consumer protection and community affairs is strengthened by the Treasury proposal to unify these responsibilities in a single agency. The bottom line is that the Fed is the best choice for consolidated supervision of systemically important financial institutions in addition to its role as independent authority on monetary policy, and these joint roles are much more complementary than they are conflicting. Indeed, there is a very natural fit between these two roles. Thank you. [The prepared statement of Dr. Meyer can be found on page 77 of the appendix.]"

"STATEMENT OF DR. JAMES K. GALBRAITH, LLOYD M. BENTSEN, JR., CHAIR IN GOVERNMENT/BUSINESS RELATIONS AND PROFESSOR OF GOVERNMENT, LBJ SCHOOL OF PUBLIC AFFAIRS, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS"," "
"Mr. Galbraith","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And as a member or an alumnus of this committee staff, it is again a pleasure and privilege to be here. I want to begin with a comment on this question of independence which has been touched on repeatedly. Vice Chairman Kohn said, and I think with very carefully chosen words, that the Congress granted a substantial degree of independence to the Federal Reserve. That independence is, of course, independence from the Executive Branch. It is not and cannot be independence from the Congress itself. The Federal Reserve may be delegated certain functions by the Congress, but the Congress can always choose to hold it accountable, and this committee, of course, has the responsibility of oversight precisely for that reason. So I think we should be very clear that, when speaking of the independence of the Federal Reserve, it is a legal independence of a kind that other regulatory institutions have had over the course of our history. It is not an independence which is specific to monetary policy per se. The question before us is whether the Federal Reserve is the best agency to take on the responsibility for regulating systemic risk, and I have some reservations about that, and I would classify them in three broad categories. The first one we might call constitutional, and I would pick up the point that was already made this afternoon by Congressman Sherman, concerning the fact that the Federal Reserve is constituted in part of regional Federal Reserve, of Federal Reserve district banks, who have boards of directors who are formed from the member banks themselves. And it is, of course, true that the district banks are represented on the Federal Open Market Committee with a voting power whose constitutionality, incidentally, was challenged in court by the chairman of this committee back in the 1970's when I was serving here on the staff. The issue was never resolved on the legal merits. It is also the case, as I understand it, that the examiners under a systemic risk supervision regime would actually reside in the district banks rather than at the Federal Reserve Board, and it seems to me this does raise a question at least of perception; that is to say, whether it is appropriate to have systemic risk regulators who are part of institutions that report in part and are accountable in part to boards of directors consisting in part of the member banks of those institutions for two reasons. One, there may be a systematic conflict between the interests of the member banks and the interests of system stability. And, secondly, there may be conflicts between the interests of member banks and the interests of other Tier I financial holding companies who are not member banks. So it seems to me that is at least a question which is worth considering as you think about the architecture of this particular system. The second concern that I would have is institutional. It is whether, in an agency whose primary functions are macroeconomic, one would ever have a commitment to the systemic risk regulation, to the supervisory responsibilities that are commensurate with the importance of that particular function. It seems to me worth pointing out that there is in the Treasury proposal basically a two-stage process, one of which is analytical, and the other one has more of an enforcement character. The analytical question is to determine what is a systemically dangerous institution to be classified as a Tier I financial holding company. That, it seems to me, would be an appropriate function to vest in the Federal Reserve Board, where an office that is incremental in the sense that Vice Chairman Kohn stipulated could decide amongst the relatively small number of large institutions who is and who is not in that category. The enforcement, the supervision, and the regulation of the behavior of the institutions, it seems to me, naturally would be more appropriately placed in an agency for whom that is the primary priority, an agency such as the FDIC. The third concern that I have is a question of really the leadership of the Federal Reserve. Historically this is--the chairmanship of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is an extremely high-profile appointment. It is an individual who tends to be close to and to need the confidence of the financial markets, and there is a real question as to whether there is any record in the history of the Federal Reserve of effective response to systemic risk in advance of crisis. This was not the case of Benjamin Strong of the 1920's, who was the leading figure at the time, although not the Chairman of the Board. It was not the case of Alan Greenspan in the run- up to the latest crisis. We had a doctrine which, in effect, denied that systemic risk could, in fact, bring down the system. That doctrine was articulated at the peak of the Federal Reserve, and it seems to me that we had a test of that proposition, and it came up wanting. So it does seem to me that there are reasons to be worried about investing the authority for systemic risk in the Federal Reserve. Thank you very much. [The prepared statement of Dr. Galbraith can be found on page 50 of the appendix.]"
"Chairman Watt","I thank you for your testimony. And, Dr. Berner, you are recognized for 5 minutes. "
"STATEMENT OF DR. RICHARD BERNER, CHIEF ECONOMIST, MORGAN STANLEY"," "
"Mr. Berner","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Paul, and other members of the committee. Thanks for inviting me to this hearing to address this important question, the role of the Federal Reserve in systemic risk regulation. I think the broader question here is how should we address the significant weaknesses in our financial system and our financial regulatory structure that the current financial crisis has exposed? Among market participants, and I talk to many of them, I think there are two policy changes that are needed that are well recognized: first, strengthen our regulatory infrastructure; and second, adopt appropriate regulation oversight to mitigate systemwide risks across financial market instruments, markets, and institutions. In addition, I believe that macroeconomic policy should lean against asset and credit booms, which create financial instability. In my view, the Federal Reserve is best equipped to take the lead on systemic risk regulation and oversight. Like others, I think this function is an essential and natural extension of the Fed's traditional monetary policy role and of its responsibilities as lender of last resort. Three factors support that claim: First, the Fed is the ultimate guardian of our financial markets, and so it should be the agency that ensures the safety and soundness of the most important financial institutions operating in those markets. Second, the process of intermediation through traditional lenders in the capital markets has become increasingly complex. Supervision of the institutions involved will enhance the Fed's ability to make the right monetary policy decisions. And, finally, the Fed's expertise in financial markets and institutions makes it the natural choice for this role. The Fed's leadership in the Supervisory Capital Assessment Program demonstrated that expertise. In short, good monetary policy and financial stability, in my view, are complementary. Asset booms and busts destabilized the economy and financial system at great cost. A financial stability mandate for the Fed requires that focus on asset and credit booms as well as systemic regulation and oversight. And the policy tools required for each overlap substantially. That may explain why the other countries that separate such responsibilities from the traditional role of the central bank have fared no better than we did in this crisis. The U.K. is a good example. While the Bank of England and the Financial Services Authority clearly have collaborated in the recent crisis, their separation of powers did not help manage the current crisis more successfully than U.S. regulators. However, naming the Fed to this role won't solve all of our problems that I just enumerated. To see why, in the rest of my time, I outline some related remedies. I will conclude by answering the four questions you posed. In my view, our regulatory system has three major shortcomings: First, we supervise institutions rather than financial activities, which allows some firms to take on risky activities with inadequate oversight. A focus on systemic risk is one remedy for that problem. Designating the Fed to take the lead will limit risky activities and important market information slipping through the cracks, and it will promote supervisory accountability. Second, our regulatory safety net is excessively prone to moral hazard, encouraging inappropriate risk-taking. Concentration, as you have all alluded to in this hearing, in our financial services industry has created institutions that are too big to fail. Remedies needed should include: more extensive oversight and supervision of large, complex financial institutions; an explicit regulatory charge on such institutions to help us offset the moral hazard created by an implicit guarantee; and a strong resolution framework that is understood by all before crisis hits. An ad hoc approach creates uncertainty and reduces the credibility of policy. The third problem is procyclicality. Our regulatory infrastructure encourages excessive leverage, which magnifies financial market volatility. Three remedies needed here are: First, we need a stronger system of capital regulation that should improve financial stability and help monetary policy lean against the wind of asset booms. We must resolve the tension between accountants who want to limit reserves and regulators who want to build them--in favor of the regulators. Second, securities must be more transparent and homogeneous and less reliant on credit ratings. And third, to reduce settlement and payment system risk, we need greater use of central counterparties for over-the-counter derivatives. I want to conclude by answering your four questions. Are there conflicts with the Fed's traditional role here? Yes, there can be. In a crisis, decisions about particular firms likely would involve the Fed in inherently political considerations and the use of taxpayer funds that could compromise its independence. We should insulate the Fed's independence with two firewalls. First, the resolution of troubled financial institutions should fall to the FDIC; and, second, and globally, we must change institutions now too big to fail into being too strong to fail. Remedies will include many of the options I just discussed. Both firewalls should strengthen the Fed's role as lender of last resort by reducing moral hazard, especially by reducing the chance that we will keep nonviable institutions alive, a concern you have expressed. What are the policy pros and cons here? In my view, the pros outweigh the cons. Interconnectedness means that supervision must look horizontally across instruments, markets, institutions, and regions rather than in vertical silos. In my view, the Fed has the most expertise and reach to provide that. The Fed is also best positioned to prescribe and enforce remedies to procyclicality and to build financial shock absorbers. Now, I hasten to state the obvious: The Fed is imperfect. As the guardian of our financial system, the Fed in the past has come up short in a number of ways. I would only say that while we consider making the Fed the lead systemic regulator, the Fed and we must examine how it can improve its functioning to take on these new duties. What about the arguments against? Well, ensuring financial stability may be too big a job for just one regulator. Even if the Fed takes the lead, coordination with other regulators will be essential for success. Coordination with regulators and central banks abroad may be even more critical than being in sync with regulators at home. Our markets and institutions are global, but our regulation is largely local. So I like the President's recommendations for the Financial Services Oversight Council and international cooperation and coordination especially. Last, what about reassigning some Federal responsibilities to other agencies? Regulators should do what they do best. And, for example, as others have said, consumer protection and promotion of financial literacy could go to another agency, but I think that the Fed may still play a useful role in supporting these areas. Mr. Chairman, let me add that these views are mine and not necessarily those of my employer, Morgan Stanley, or its staff. I want to thank you for your attention. I am happy to answer any questions. [The prepared statement of Dr. Berner can be found on page 46 of the appendix.]"
"Chairman Watt","Thank you for your testimony. Dr. Taylor, you are recognized for 5 minutes. "
"STATEMENT OF DR. JOHN B. TAYLOR, MARY AND ROBERT RAYMOND PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, STANFORD UNIVERSITY"," "
"Mr. Taylor","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Paul, and members of this subcommittee, for inviting me to testify on this important subject. In my view, the Administration's plan would grant to the Fed significant new powers, more powers than it has ever had before. These powers would include determining whether a financial firm is a threat to financial stability. These designated firms by the Fed would then be put in a special group called Tier I FHCs, financial holding companies. The Fed would then have the power to supervise and regulate this newly defined group. And the firms in this group would be subject to this new resolution regime chosen by the Fed. Taken as a whole, these powers mean that the Fed would be a systemic risk regulator. Though that term is not defined in the documents, I take it as a definition these new powers. In my view, these new powers will negatively affect the Fed's role as an independent monetary authority. I have four main concerns. First, it seems to me that the additional powers and responsibilities would dilute the key mission of the Federal Reserve, which is to maintain overall economic and price stability by controlling the growth of the money supply and thereby influencing the overall level of interest rates in the economy. My experience in government, including the U.S. Treasury and elsewhere, is that institutions work best when they focus on a limited set of understandable goals and are held accountable to the public for achieving these goals. As the number of goals and the lack of clarity increases, the effectiveness and the performance generally decline. My second concern is that responsibility for these new Tier I financial holding companies would reduce credibility of the Federal Reserve by involving it directly in potentially controversial decisions. In fact, it seems to me the experience of the last few months illustrates this problem. The Fed's credibility is an extraordinarily valuable asset, and it would be terrible to lose that asset. My third concern is that the plan would create a conflict of interest. Indeed, this has been discussed widely already at this hearing with the Vice Chairman and others. In my view, firms in the Tier I financial holding company category would be perceived as too big to fail and perhaps even too big to resolve to go through that complicated process that is being proposed. In my view, there will therefore be a temptation to adjust the instruments of monetary policy, the money supply or the interest rates to help protect these institutions. It is a natural evolution. Lower interest rates, whether or not appropriate, will be harmful to the economy, and a larger Fed's balance sheet when not appropriate would be harmful to the economy. My fourth concern is that by giving so much new power to the Federal Reserve, that the plan would actually threaten the Fed's independence regarding monetary policy. Why would this be the case? In my view, sooner or later the increased power will result in checks and limits on it, perhaps through micromanaged political interference or perhaps through legislative change. It would be impossible, as some have suggested, in practice to prevent such interference from spreading from the new regulatory powers and supervisory powers to the traditional monetary function of the Fed. After all, they are in the same institution, and they are run by the same CEO. I think this loss of Federal Reserve independence is a serious issue, especially at this time of rapidly growing Federal debt and greatly expanded Federal Reserve balance sheet. Actually, I could not do any better than to quote a former Secretary of the Treasury, also former Secretary of State, Secretary of Labor, and Director of the Budget, Secretary George Shultz, who, after studying carefully the events of the last few months, came up with the following statement. And I quote Secretary Shultz: ``Observing this process, the question comes forcefully at you, has the accord gone down the drain?'' The Secretary, of course, is referring to the 1951 accord where the Fed regained its independence from the Treasury, which it had lost during World War II, and was committed to pegging Treasury interest rates. And then he goes on to say: And remember how difficult it was for the Fed to disentangle itself from the Treasury in the post-World War II period. So these are very serious concerns, my four concerns, and I would be happy to answer any questions you have about them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. [The prepared statement of Dr. Taylor can be found on page 86 of the appendix.] Chairman. Watt. Thank you, Dr. Taylor. Dr. Meltzer, you are recognized for 5 minutes. "
"STATEMENT OF DR. ALLAN H. MELTZER, THE ALLAN H. MELTZER UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR OF POLITICAL ECONOMY, TEPPER SCHOOL OF BUSINESS, CARNEGIE MELLON UNIVERSITY"," "
"Mr. Meltzer","Thank you, Chairman Watt. And greetings to my old friend, Congressman Ron Paul, and to the members. Thank you for the opportunity to present my appraisal of the Administration's proposal for regulatory changes. I will confine most of my comments to the role of the Federal Reserve as a systemic regulator, and will offer an alternative proposal much closer to the Republican proposal. I share the belief that change is needed and long delayed, but appropriate change must protect the public, not the bankers. During much of the past 15 years, I have written three volumes entitled, ``A History of the Federal Reserve.'' Working with two assistants, we have read virtually all of the of the minutes of the Board of Governors, the Federal Open Market Committee, and the Directors of the New York Federal Reserve Bank. We have also read many of the staff papers and the internal memos supporting decisions. I speak from that perspective. Two findings are very relevant for the role of the Federal Reserve. First, I do not know of any single clear example in which the Federal Reserve acted in advance to head off a crisis or a series of banking and financial failures. We all know of several where it failed to act in advance. Members of Congress should ask themselves this question: Can you expect the Federal Reserve or anyone else as systemic regulators to close Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac after Congress has decided that it declined to act? What kind of a conflict is that going to pose? And how is it going to be resolved? Second, in its 96-year history, the Federal Reserve has never announced a lender of last resort policy. It has discussed internally the content of such a policy several times, but it rarely announced what it would do. And the announcements that it made, as in 1987, were limited to the circumstances of that time. Announcing and following a policy would alert financial institutions to the Fed's expected actions and might reduce pressures on Congress to aid failing entities. Following the rule in a crisis, the lender-of-last-resort rule in a crisis would change bankers' incentives and reduce moral hazard. A crisis policy rule is long overdue. The Administration proposal recognizes the need, but doesn't propose the rule. Experiences in the past from the history suggest three main lessons: First, we cannot avoid banking failures, but we can keep them from spreading and creating crises; Second, neither the Federal Reserve nor any other Agency has succeeded in predicting crises or anticipating systemic failure. It is hard to do, in part because systemic risk is not well defined. Reasonable people will differ, and since much is often at stake, some will fight hard to deny that there is a systemic risk. One of the main reasons that Congress in 1991 passed FDICIA, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation Improvement Act, was to prevent the Federal Reserve from delaying closure of failing banks, increasing losses, and weakening the FDIC fund. The Federal Reserve and the FDIC have not used FDICIA against large banks in this crisis. That should change. The third lesson is that a successful policy will alter bankers' incentives and avoid moral hazard. Bankers must know that risk-taking brings both rewards and costs, including failure, loss of managerial position and equity, followed by sale of continuing operations. Several reforms are needed to reduce or eliminate the cost of financial failure to the taxpayers. Members of Congress should ask themselves and each other, is the banker or the regulator more likely to know about the risks on the bank's balance sheet? Of course, it is the banker, and especially so if the banker is taking large risks that he wants to hide. To me, that means the reform should start by increasing the banker's responsibility for losses. The Administration proposal does the opposite, by making the Federal Reserve responsible for systemic risk. Systemic risk is a term of art; I doubt that it can be defined in a way that satisfies the many parties involved in regulation. Members of Congress will properly urge that any large failure in their district is systemic. Administrations and regulators will have other objectives. Without a clear definition, the proposal will bring frequent controversy, and without a clear definition, the proposal is incomplete. Resolving the conflicting interests is unlikely to protect the general public. More likely, regulators will claim that they protect the public by protecting the banks. I think that is wrong. I believe there are better alternatives than the Administration's proposal. First step, end ``too big to fail.'' Require all financial institutions to increase capital more than in proportion to the increase in the size of their assets. ``Too big to fail'' is perverse; it allows banks to profit in good times and shifts the losses to the taxpayers when crises or failures occur. Second step, require the Federal Reserve to announce a rule for ``lender of last resort.'' Congress should adopt a rule that they are willing to sustain. The rule should give banks an incentive to hold collateral to be used in a crisis period. Bagehot's Rule from the 19th Century Bank of England is a great place to start. Third step, recognize that regulation is an ineffective way to change behavior. My first rule of regulation states that lawyers regulate, but markets circumvent burdensome regulation. The Basel Accord is a current example. It told banks to hold more reserves if they held more risky assets. So they put the assets off their balance sheets. Later, after the fact, they had to take them back, but that was after the fact. Fourth step, recognize that regulators do not allow for the incentives induced by their regulations. In the dynamic financial markets, it is difficult, perhaps impossible, to anticipate how clever market participants will circumvent the rules without violating them. The fifth step, either extend FDICIA to include holding companies or subject financial holding companies to bankruptcy law. Make the holding company subject to early intervention either under FDICIA or under bankruptcy law. That not only reduces or eliminates taxpayer losses, but it also encourages prudential behavior. Other important changes should be made. Congress should close Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and put any subsidy for low- income housing on the budget. The same should be done to other credit market subsidies. The budget is the proper place for subsidies. Three principles should be borne in mind: First, banks borrow short and lend long. Unanticipated large changes can and will cause failures. Our problem is to minimize the costs of failures to society. Second, remember that capitalism without failure is like religion without sin. It removes incentives for prudent behavior. Third, those that rely on regulation to reduce risks should recall that this is the age of Madoff. The Fed, too, lacks a record of success in managing large risks to the financial system, the economy, and the public. Incentives for fraud, evasion, and circumvention of regulation often have been more powerful than incentives to enforce regulation that protects the public. Thank you, sir. [The prepared statement of Dr. Meltzer can be found on page 71 of the appendix.]"
"Chairman Watt","I thank the gentleman for his extensive statement. I am going to recognize the members for questions, and I will just reserve my questions until last if we have time, because we have to be out of here by 5 o'clock. There is another meeting. I recognize the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Paul, for 5 minutes."
"Dr. Paul","I thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I welcome the panel. It is especially nice to see Dr. Meltzer here. I would like to start with a question of Dr. Meltzer because I wanted to follow up on his testimony about the Latin America crisis, where you mention that the Federal Reserve went to the IMF and instructed the IMF to pay interest to those banks that were exposed. And, of course, that was without congressional permission, and I think it makes a point, one of the points I have been trying to make, and that is transparency of the Federal Reserve. Now it sounded to me like the majority here is for independence, which is a code word for secrecy and in opposition to transparency. And it is always used for the public interest. Of course, I think the public interest is served by exposure and knowing what is going on and whose interests are being served, and that is why I would like to see a lot more transparency. But the question I have for Dr. Meltzer is, since he is aware of this, he has published this, is this a good reason for us to know a lot more about the agreements that the Federal Reserve makes? Because they can make agreements with international banking institutions, and we have no right--we may have a right under the Constitution that we should, but we don't--and we have given up that right, we have given up that privilege. Would this be a good example of why we need to know more of what exactly the Federal Reserve is doing?"
"Mr. Meltzer","Yes. Let me begin by saying independence, to me and, I believe, to many of the members of the panel, does not mean lack of transparency. It means protection. The reason we have independent central banks is so that they don't expand under pressure from Congress, from the Administration, from the banking community, and from others. We want them to be independent, to make their judgments without--because they are obligated by law to maintain high employment and low inflation. Now, that law doesn't work very well, at least in my opinion, but that is why we want independence. So transparency, how can you be against transparency? But I believe the Congress would be more effective in its oversight of the Federal Reserve if it concentrated much more on outcomes and much less on process. Let them make their decisions the way they want to make them and monitor the process. They are not living up to the mandate to maintain full employment or high employment and low inflation, and that is what we should be concerned about."
"Dr. Paul","I thank you. And I am going to hurry along because our 5 minutes runs out rather quickly. But I wanted to ask Dr. Galbraith a question, because he has worked here and he knows the system, so I have been rather shocked at what you presented here. You actually talked about the Constitution. Didn't you find out that we are not supposed to do that around here? We don't have that much concern about it. So I was delighted, from my viewpoint, that you brought this up and reminded us about Henry Ruess's concern about the constitutionality of the FOMC. And, of course, I agree with that. But I wanted to see if there was a little bit more that you might agree with, because there are some who believe that we shouldn't be doing anything unless it is explicitly authorized. And, of course, the central bank is not authorized. It has been ordained by the courts and the Congress, but it was never explicitly authorized. But the point, the more practical point that I might be able to get you to comment on is the concept of the budget. I mean, the Fed is a government unto itself. You know, they hire and make their wages and it doesn't go through the ordinary process. The Constitution says it should all go through the constitutional process. And also maybe you could comment on these foreign agreements. These are like treaties. The Federal Reserve goes and makes these agreements, and they pass out money. Does this strike you as maybe that too might be challenged if you happen to come at this from a constitutional viewpoint?"
"Mr. Galbraith","Well, I think under the Constitution, the Congress has every right for whatever information it seeks from the Federal Reserve. And if the Congress were to decide to change the way the Federal Reserve is funded, it would also have the right to do that. It seems to me it would be an appropriate decision for Congress to make."
"Dr. Paul","So they would then have a right--so my proposal that we find out more, you would say that would be right and proper to find out what type of agreements they have made with other governments, other central banks, international banking organizations?"
"Mr. Galbraith","My own view on this is that as a Member of Congress, you are entitled to that information. That would be the position I would have understood to be the case when I was working here 30 years ago."
"Dr. Paul","Thank you."
"Chairman Watt","The time of the gentleman has expired. The gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say, I thought this was a very good panel. I think you had some good ideas. Whether one agrees or not with the concept of where we are going to go, I would hope that staff and all of us will take note of what you stated here today. I think it makes a difference. I might start with you, Dr. Meyer. You basically indicated that in going to systemic risk regulation, it wouldn't be a great change as far as the Fed is concerned. I don't mean to put words in your mouth, but that was my impression of what you stated. And if that is the case--and others have indicated that the Fed did not anticipate particularly well the problems which have arisen in the banking industry in the last year or two, but if that is the case, is it arguable that the Fed had some of this power and did not succeed in carrying out the responsibility of dealing with systemic risk to the limits they had before, and therefore we should question whether they should expand or not?"
"Mr. Meyer","First, let me reiterate what I said before, and I agree with Vice Chairman Kohn here, that what the Treasury proposal does is very incremental and not very dramatic, not a vast expansion of powers--basically asking the Fed to do what it has been doing as bank holding company supervisor and extending that reach to a modest degree over systemically important financial institutions that don't have a bank. I think it is clear that the Federal Reserve didn't distinguish itself in carrying out its responsibilities as supervisor and regulator of banks and bank holding companies. This is an extraordinary period; it is the first financial crisis since the Great Depression, and I don't believe any other financial supervisor or regulator carried out its responsibilities to protect the safety and soundness of the banks and institutions under their control in this circumstance either. So I think what we need to do is not only ask the Fed to carry out its responsibilities, but to encourage it to do what I think it would otherwise do, to change capital standards that make them more onerous for systemically important institutions, carry out more macroprudential supervision than it has done before, although, let me say, the Treasury proposal separates that out and gives that responsibility mainly to Treasury-- well, mainly to the risk council that is staffed by Treasury and chaired by the Secretary."
"Mr. Castle","Thank you. I am not sure I understand all that quite yet, but I will try to absorb it. But I appreciate your answer. Dr. Berner, you indicated that coordination with other regulators will be essential on this. Can you be more explicit about that? What other regulators? I assume the FDIC and others. And exactly what that coordination would be? Would this be something that the Federal Reserve would do on its own, or should there be some sort of a council in which they would meet on a regular basis? How would that coordination occur, in your mind at least?"
"Mr. Berner","Well, I mentioned that there are probably two aspects to that coordination. One is within our own boundaries in the United States and for U.S. financial institutions. But I also think that we need to coordinate globally, since our markets and institutions are global as well. As far as the United States is concerned, you know, we have a multiplicity of regulators. And even in the sweeping proposal from the Treasury or in other regulatory proposals, I haven't heard any move to, you know, to consolidate them all into one. And as I indicated, it is not clear to me that doing so would produce a better outcome. So the coordination would have to take place among the various regulators that we have, however we reshape them, so that information doesn't slip through the cracks, so that we don't miss the activities of institutions who are regulated by one group or one regulator, but who are engaged in activities that are properly the responsibility of--if you will, collectively all the regulators. That extends, I think, across borders because markets are global. And so we need to coordinate, or the Federal Reserve and other regulators will need to coordinate across borders with their counterparts overseas, taking into account what institutions are doing either to, as Dr. Meltzer indicated, avoid regulation by doing things in one place rather than in another, so that they are aware of what is going on and so that they can appropriately safeguard markets and institutions."
"Mr. Castle","I think what you have just discussed is vitally important. And I hope everybody gives a lot of thought to exactly how that would be done, because I think ultimately that is something that is going to have to happen no matter which way we go. Dr. Galbraith, you indicated, I thought--"
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired."
"Mr. Castle","I am sorry. I yield back. I may write to you about that question."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Lance, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me agree with my colleagues that I believe this is an extremely distinguished panel, and it is my privilege to participate this afternoon. Dr. Galbraith, to follow up on some of the questioning of Ranking Member Paul, you indicated one way out of the difficulty might be the elimination of the boards of directors of the regional Federal Reserve Banks, or alternatively, to remove the voting power of the regional bank presidents on the"
"FOMC."," Realistically, is that likely to occur?"
"Mr. Galbraith","As a witness, it is not my responsibility to be the most realistic person."
"Mr. Lance","We do rely on your expertise, however."
"Mr. Galbraith","I do think that one has to look at this question of the perception of a privileged position to whom the presidents of the regional districts are responsible."
"Mr. Lance","Absolutely."
"Mr. Galbraith","An alternative, of course, is not to put the examining power in the regional Federal Reserve Banks, to leave it in the hands of a tough cop who is entirely autonomous."
"Mr. Lance","Yes. I think on our side of the aisle we have great difficulty with reposing these powers in the Federal Reserve Board at all. To Dr. Taylor and Dr. Meltzer, regarding the establishing of Tier I financial holding companies, I think many of us have a concern that if that were to occur, there would be some sort of assumption that they would have the backing of the Federal Government. We already may be in that place in some areas, and certainly we were in that place regarding Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Your comments, both of you as distinguished persons regarding this area of your expertise, could you elaborate on that a little bit for me?"
"Mr. Taylor","Yes. I think the reason why I would characterize this proposal as giving significant, not incremental powers to the Federal Reserve, largely lies in this ability to distinguish certain institutions as a threat to the financial system as defined by the Treasury. And so once an institution--we don't know, quite frankly, how many there will be; it is not clear. I think that would be a good question to ask Treasury or the Fed, but it could be quite large."
"Mr. Lance","In your opinion, could you give us an estimate as to how many you think it might be?"
"Mr. Taylor","I have no idea. That is one of the problems."
"Mr. Lance","Yes, sir."
"Mr. Taylor","Operationally, there is no definition of ``systemic risk'' here, and so it could be quite large. It might not be, by the way, this Federal Reserve, these people, who make the decision; it could be their successors."
"Mr. Lance","Yes, sir."
"Mr. Taylor","And so I think the danger is, just as you say, once these institutions are in this group, then they do become too big to fail, certainly--in fact, probably too big to resolve because it will look like a black mark. And so they could become Fannie Maes and Freddie Macs of the future."
"Mr. Lance","Yes. Thank you."
"Dr. Meltzer?",""
"Mr. Meltzer","Yes, I like your emphasis on realism. That is--"
"Mr. Lance","I am new here, so I am sure I will get over it."
"Mr. Meltzer","Try hard not to. The realism, to me, says what would the systemic risk regulator do with the Tier I holding companies? In my opinion, it would be Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, writ large."
"Mr. Lance","That is my concern."
"Mr. Meltzer","These are going to be banks or institutions that are going to have branches all over the country. Every Member will feel an obligation to say, we can't let that happen in our district and in our districts. And so too big to fail will really become an even greater problem now. How can you limit the risks that bankers, some bankers, are going to take? Make them bear the risk."
"Mr. Lance","Thank you. Thank you very much. I yield back the balance of my time, Mr. Chairman. Thank you."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman yields back. The gentleman from Alabama, Mr. Bachus, is recognized for 5 minutes."
"Mr. Bachus","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Meyer, you described the proposed changes as incremental to the Federal Reserve?"
"Mr. Meyer","Right."
"Mr. Bachus","Reading the Treasury proposal on what they say about it, they say this report proposes a number of major changes to the formal powers and duties of the Federal Reserve, including the addition of several new financial stability responsibilities. These proposals would put into effect the biggest changes to the Federal Reserve's authority in years--or decades."
"Mr. Meyer","I think you have to read the rest of the report and see whether you agree with that. I read the rest of the report, and I don't see that there is this vast new power. The Administration possibly wants to look at this as a more sweeping set of proposals than perhaps it is."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay."
"Mr. Meyer","But as Vice Chairman Kohn said, that is just not the case."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. So actually, you don't agree with their description of--"
"Mr. Meyer","Absolutely not."
"Mr. Bachus","--their own plan? Okay. Let me ask the panelists, can you function as a systemic risk regulator of significant institutions without a robust examination and supervision authority? Can you do that?"
"Mr. Meyer","Impossible."
"Mr. Bachus","Impossible?"
"Mr. Galbraith","I agree."
"Mr. Mishkin","I completely agree here that clearly part of this issue of being a systemic risk regulator is that you have to go in and know what is going on in the institutions that you are regulating. And so I think it is essential that this be part of the role. And I think clearly that there is already an element of this, a very strong element in what the Federal Reserve does now with the bank holding companies."
"Mr. Bachus","Do you think the Federal Reserve had a robust supervision and examination of those institutions that failed, including AIG?"
"Mr. Mishkin","Well, certainly the Federal Reserve did not have this responsibility for AIG."
"Mr. Bachus","Well, they were a holding company, were they not?"
"Mr. Meyer","Not a bank holding company."
"Mr. Mishkin","Not a bank holding company."
"Mr. Bachus","How about Citi?"
"Mr. Meltzer","But they have people monitoring Citigroup and all from the New York Fed every day. Did they find anything at Citigroup? Nothing that they were willing to do anything about."
"Mr. Bachus","And I guess Wachovia was a bank holding company. Does the Fed--do they have, you think, the robust examination or supervision, or is that something that the OCC or the FDIC does on a day-to-day basis?"
"Mr. Meyer","The OCC and the FDIC have never been responsible for consolidated supervision. They have no history of doing that. The FDIC does not have a supervisory staff that has any expertise in the complex banking situation of the institutions we are talking about. The OCC is already involved and was the bank supervisor of many of the institutions that have gotten into trouble. And in most of the large institutions, OCC is the bank supervisor and the Fed is the holding company supervisor, and they both have to work together."
"Mr. Bachus","Yes. And they didn't do that in the last--"
"Mr. Meyer","Well, I think--let's say, neither distinguished themselves."
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. I agree. Do we need to determine the causes of the present financial crisis before we start legislating a fix? And have we done that?"
"Mr. Galbraith","It would be very helpful, in my view, to conduct a full and independent investigation into the cause of the financial crisis, similar to the Pecora Committee investigations of the early 1930's."
"Mr. Bachus","How about Dr. Mishkin? Do you agree?"
"Mr. Mishkin","Well, I think that clearly we do have to think more about these issues and that, in particular, the rush to do regulatory reform is something that I have been concerned about. I do actually think, however, that the need for a resolution authority is absolutely critical. And so--"
"Mr. Bachus","And I don't disagree."
"Mr. Mishkin","And I think that one of my concerns has been that if we go down the route of worrying about the big picture and then don't do anything, that we are actually in a situation which not only means institutions can get in trouble, and we can't do anything about them, but also we are in a very weak position to get them to fix things because we have no ammunition."
"Mr. Bachus","Let me say this. The Republican proposal is for an enhanced resolution, a bankruptcy-like proceeding for nonbank financial companies. I don't know. Have you all looked at the Republican proposal?"
"Mr. Taylor","Not in detail."
"Chairman Watt","The gentleman's time has expired. And I would encourage him to send each of these witnesses the Republican proposal."
"Mr. Bachus","How about a second round of questions?"
"Chairman Watt","Unfortunately, there is another meeting scheduled, as I had previously announced, in this room at 5 o'clock. If we had been more expeditious on the Floor, perhaps we could have had more time to do what we do in committee. And I am not trying to be mean about it. I just--"
"Mr. Bachus","I don't think you are being mean."
"Chairman Watt","I can't give more time than the room allows me to give. The gentleman's time has expired. Dr. Galbraith, let me just ask one question. You distinguished between the two responsibilities on the bottom of page 2 and top of page 3 of your testimony. One was to identify as Tier I financial holding companies considered to be so large and interconnected; and then the second was the institution of a regime of examination and regulation. If the first part of that--the first one of those, I take it you concluded, was not constitutionally suspect to be done by the Fed?"
"Mr. Galbraith","It could be done in the Federal Reserve Board, and it would be an incremental responsibility of the kind that Vice Chairman Kohn described, yes."
"Chairman Watt","And then I take it that you are recommending that the second part of that be undertaken by the FDIC."
"Mr. Galbraith","By an agency for whom it is the highest priority and for whom it is a major mission, yes."
"Chairman Watt","Even for institutions that are not federally insured. What about--"
"Mr. Galbraith","Yes."
"Chairman Watt","Okay. The Chair notes that members may have additional questions for this panel which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to these witnesses and to place their responses in the record. I thank the witnesses for their unending patience throughout the afternoon, and regret that we have to rush out of the room. Otherwise, we would be happy to go another round. But I am sure the members will follow up with vigorous written questions, and I encourage you to answer them as expeditiously as you can so that we can continue the process moving along. I thank you for coming. And the hearing is adjourned.   "
