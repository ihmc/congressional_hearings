"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. My apologies to our witnesses and my colleagues. Today is the 200th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln's birthday and I took my daughter up to Lincoln's cottage this morning up at the Old Soldier's Home where there was a ceremony this morning to unveil a wonderful statue of Abraham Lincoln and his horse Old Boy that he used to ride every morning for about a quarter of his Presidency from the White House to the Old Soldiers Home where he lived for a quarter of that Presidency and he wrote the Emancipation Proclamation. So I thought I would take my daughter out of school this morning for a bit of history and I am sorry to be a few minutes late getting back here this morning, so apologies to everybody for being a few minutes late for enjoying a moment of history with a 7-year-old. Well, let me begin with some opening comments, if I can. I will turn to Senator Shelby. We are honored to have such a distinguished panel of witnesses with us this morning on an issue that many of my colleagues know has been a source of interest of mine for literally two decades, the issue of reform of the credit card industry. And so this hearing this morning will give us a chance to reengage in that debate and discussion, and I want my colleagues to know at some point, and I say this to my good friend, the former Chairman of the Committee, at some point, I would like to be able to mark up a bill in this area. I know he knows that, but I wanted to say so publicly. So good morning to everyone, and today the Committee meets to look into an issue of vital importance to American consumers, their families, and to the stability of our financial system, and that is the need to reform the practices of our nation's credit card companies and to provide some tough new protections for consumers. In my travels around my State, as I am sure it is true of my colleagues, as well, we frequently hear from constituents about the burden of abusive credit card practices. In fact, the average amount of household credit card debt in my State is over $7,100. Actually, the number is higher, I think, nationally. Non-business bankruptcy filings in the State are increasing. In the second quarter of last year, credit card delinquencies increased in seven of eight counties in my State. Across the country, cardholders are paying $12 billion in penalty fees annually, every year. It is a major problem throughout our nation. At a time when our economy is in crisis and consumers are struggling financially, credit card companies in too many cases are gouging, hiking interest rates on consumers who pay on time and consistently meet the terms of their credit card agreements. They impose penalty interest rates, some as high as 32 percent, and many contain clauses allowing them to change the terms of the agreement, including the interest rate, at any time, for any reason. These practices can leave mountains of debt for families and financial ruin in far too many cases. When I introduced Secretary Geithner earlier this week as he unveiled the framework of the President's plan to stabilize our financial system, I noted then for too long, our leading regulators had failed fully to realize that financial health and security of the consumers is inextricably linked to the success of the American economy. In fact, for too many years, I think people assumed that consumer protection and economic growth were antithetical to each other. Quite the opposite is true. I noted that unless we apply the same urgent focus to helping consumers that we apply to supporting our banks' efforts to restart lending, we will not be able to break the negative cycle of rising foreclosures and declining credit that is damaging our economy. In this hearing, the Committee examines abusive credit card practices that harm consumers and explores some very specific legislative ideas to end them. These kinds of consumer protections must be at the forefront of our efforts to modernize our financial regulatory system. Why is this both important and urgent? Well, today, far too many American families are forced to rely on short-term, high- interest credit card debt to finance their most basic necessities. And as layoffs continue, home values plunge, and home equity lines of credit are cut or canceled, they are increasingly falling behind. This December, the number of credit card payments that were late by 60 days or more went up 16.2 percent from last year. Banks increasingly worried about taking more debt, bad debt, into their balance sheets are monitoring their credit card portfolios very closely, slashing credit lines and increasing fees and interest rates even more for consumers who have held up their end of the bargain. That puts consumers, including many of my constituents and others around the country, in the worst possible position at the worst possible time. For too long, the use of confusing, misleading, and predatory practices have been standard operating procedures for many in the credit card industry. The list of troubling practices that credit card companies are engaged in is lengthy and it is disturbing: Predatory rates, fees, and charges; anytime, any reason interest rate increases and account charges; retroactive interest rate increases; deceptive marketing to young people; shortening the period consumers have to pay their bills with no warning. Even the Federal financial regulators, of whom I have been openly critical for a lack of appropriate oversight throughout this subprime mortgage market crisis, recognize the harm these sinister practices pose not only to credit card customers, but also to our economy. Last May, the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the National Credit Union Administration proposed rules aimed at curbing some of these practices. These rules were a good step and I applaud them, but they are long overdue. But they fell far short of what is actually needed, in my view, to protect American families. Just as we have seen in this housing crisis, when companies lure people into financial arrangements that are deceptive, abusive, and predatory, it only means mountains of debt for families, bankruptcy, and financial ruin for far too many. It also proved catastrophic, of course, for our economy. Today as the Committee examines how best to modernize and reform our outdated and ineffective financial regulatory system, we have a clear message to send to the industry. Your days of bilking American families at the expense of our economy are over. Today, we will discuss proposals to reform abusive credit card practices that drag so many American families deeper and deeper and deeper into debt, including the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act, which I recently reintroduced. We must protect the rights of financially responsible credit card users so that if a credit card company delayed crediting your payment, you aren't charged for this mistake. We must prevent issuers from changing the terms of a credit card contract before the term is up. And perhaps most importantly, we must protect our young people who are faced with an onslaught of credit card offers, often years before they turn 18, or as soon as they set foot onto a college campus. These practices are wrong and they are unfair. And mark my words, in the coming months, they are going to end. Of course, we must do all we can to encourage consumers to also act responsibly when it comes to using credit cards. But we should demand such responsible behavior when it comes to the companies that issue these cards, as well. The need to reform credit card practice has never been more important. It is not only the right thing to do for families and our consumers, it is the right thing to do for our economy, as well. I have been working on reforms in this area for many, many years and I am determined to move forward on these reforms. With that, let me turn to our former Chairman and Ranking Member, Richard Shelby. "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHELBY"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Although problems with mortgage-related assets have taken center stage in our ongoing financial crisis, credit card lending has also rapidly declined as our economy has deteriorated. The securitization market, a key vehicle for financing credit card transactions, remains severely constrained, at its best. The absence of a robust secondary market has deprived many financial institutions of the financing needed to support credit card-based lending. Unable to securitize their credit card portfolios, many banks have been forced to cut back their customers' credit limits or even terminate their customers' credit cards altogether. In the midst of these challenging market conditions, the Federal Reserve, along with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, finalized new rules last December that will drastically alter the credit card industry. The rules prohibit a variety of business practices and impose a new layer of complex regulation. They also update and enhance certain consumer protections. The new rules will be implemented over the next year and a half, but already, financial institutions are drastically altering their credit card practices, as they should. Recent reports suggest that the new rules will cause a substantial contraction in consumer credit. While I believe that there are many credit card practices that need reforming, as Senator Dodd mentioned, I also believe that regulators need to be especially careful in this time of financial stress not to take actions that unduly restrict the availability of credit. Limiting the ability of consumers of low and moderate means to obtain credit could have unfortunate consequences. If they can't get credit from regulated banks, they may seek it outside the banking system. Regulators must exercise caution to ensure that the appropriate balance is struck between adequately safeguarding consumers, which is important to all of us, while not eliminating access to credit for millions of American families. Regulators also need to make sure that they do not stifle innovation or unduly restrict consumer choice. Many innovative products that have been demanded by and have benefited consumers, including zero percent financing, may be eliminated or severely curtailed because of the recent regulatory rule changes. We can all agree that abusive products should be addressed, and soon, but we should also be careful not to eliminate legitimate products in doing that. An overly broad approach risks giving consumers a false sense of security. Too often, consumers fail to consider whether a particular financial product is right for them because they believe that Federal regulators have already determined which products are safe and which are dangerous. Yet in many cases, whether a financial product is appropriate for a consumer depends on the consumer's own financial position. If the financial crisis has taught us anything, it is that all sectors of our economy, from big commercial banks to retail consumers, need to do more due diligence before they enter into financial transactions. No regulator can protect a consumer as much as they can protect themselves if they have the necessary information, which is why clear, complete, and understandable disclosure, as Senator Dodd has pushed for years, is so critical. Several bills have been introduced that seek to codify the recent rule changes, and in several instances would go beyond those rules to enact even more severe regulations. I believe before we legislate in this area, I think we should be careful. I would prefer that we give regulators the necessary time to implement the rule changes and then we can evaluate how those rules have worked and what changes are needed. In this time of economic turmoil, we need to proceed carefully, but we do need to proceed. We need to be especially careful not to undermine the ability of our financial system to accurately price risk. The advent of risk-based pricing has helped our financial institutions expand the availability of credit. Undermining the ability of banks to employ risk-based pricing could reverse this very positive development. As this Committee begins to consider regulatory reform, I believe it is important to keep in mind the need to balance carefully our strong desire to protect consumers and the absolute necessity of preserving an innovative and diverse marketplace. These are not mutually exclusive concepts and it is our job--our obligation--to craft a regulatory structure that can accommodate them both, and I hope we will."
"Senator Johnson"," The Chairman has stepped out momentarily to confer with Secretary Geithner and Mr. Summers. Does anyone want to comment briefly before we get to the panelists? Senator Reed?"
"Senator Reed","I will pass, Mr. Chairman, and defer to my colleagues if they would like to speak."
"Senator Johnson","Anybody? "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR BROWN"," "
"Senator Brown","Mr. Chairman, I would like to make a couple of comments. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Senator Johnson. I think a lot of us--I appreciate the comments both of Senator Shelby and the Chairman. A lot of us are particularly concerned about credit card targeting of young people. Go to any college campus across this country, in my State, Ohio State, the largest university in the country, you will see that college students are inundated with credit card applications. Ohio State's own Web site counsels students to, quote, ``avoid credit card debt while you are a college student.'' We know what kind of debt students face anyway and I think that just paints the picture of how serious this is. There are other examples of what has happened with small business and it is so important. I just underscore how important this issue is and that we move forward on more consumer protections. I yield my time back."
"Senator Johnson","Senator Akaka, you have a comment to make? "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR AKAKA"," "
"Senator Akaka","Yes. Thank you very much. I appreciate the Chairman holding this hearing. Too many in our country are burdened by significant credit card debt. Not enough has been done to protect consumers and ensure they are able to properly manage their credit burden. We must do more to educate, protect, and empower consumers. Three Congresses ago, or the 108th Congress, I advocated for enactment of my Credit Card Minimum Payment Warning Act. I developed the legislation with Senators at that time, Senators Sarbanes, Durbin, Schumer, and Leahy. We attempted to attach the bill as an amendment to improve the flawed minimum payment warning in the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act. Unfortunately, our amendment was defeated. My legislation, which I will be reintroducing shortly, requires companies to inform consumers how many years and months it will take to repay their entire balance if they make only minimum payments. The total cost of interest and principal if the consumer pays only the minimum payment would also have to be disclosed. These provisions will make individuals much more aware of the true costs of credit card debt. The bill also requires that credit card companies provide useful information so that people can develop strategies to free themselves of credit card debt. Consumers would have to be provided with the amount they need to pay to eliminate their outstanding balance within 36 months. My legislation also addresses the related issue of credit counseling. We must ensure that people who seek help in dealing with complex financial issues, such as debt management, are able to locate the assistance they need. Credit card billing statements should include contact information for reputable credit counseling services. More working families are trying to survive financially and meet their financial obligations. They often seek out help from credit counselors to better manage their debt burdens. It is extremely troubling that unscrupulous credit counselors exploit for their own personal profit individuals who are trying to locate the assistance they need. My legislation establishes quality standards for credit counseling agencies and ensures that consumers would be referred to trustworthy credit counselors. As financial pressures increase for working families, credit counseling becomes even more important. As we work to reform the regulatory structure of financial services, it is essential that we establish credit counseling standards and increase regulatory oversight over this industry. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate your inclusion of this in your bill, of a provision that mirrors the minimum payment warning provisions in my bill. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Johnson","Thank you, Senator Akaka. Senator Menendez, do you have a very brief statement to make? "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR MENENDEZ"," "
"Senator Menendez","I will make a brief statement. I don't know about very brief, Mr. Chairman. I will make a brief statement."
"Senator Schumer","Moderately brief. "
"Senator Menendez","Moderately brief. Let me thank the Chairman for holding this hearing. Credit card reform has been one of the top priorities that I have had both in the House and in the Senate since I arrived here, and I think this hearing couldn't come at a more important time, when millions of Americans are increasingly using their credit cards to float their basic necessities from month to month. As a result, Americans have almost $1 trillion of credit card debt outstanding. It seems to me that it is a dangerous cycle that is piling up. And while that debt is piling up, people in our State and across the country are discovering that their credit card agreements often conceal all kinds of trap doors behind a layer of fine print. If you take one false step, then your credit rating plummets and your interest rate shoots through the roof. Many of my constituents have contacted me after facing sky- high interest rates they never expected after accepting one offer, only to learn later that the terms seem to have been written in erasable ink, or after watching in horror as their children in college get swallowed in debt. So for far too many people, credit card is already a personal financial crisis and I believe it is a national crisis. Our economy will not recover if debt ties down consumers tighter and tighter, and making credit card lending practices fairer would be the right thing to do under any circumstances, but under these economic conditions, it is an absolute necessity. Mr. Chairman, I have legislation, as well. Some of it has been incorporated in what I think Chairman Dodd is going to include. I appreciate those efforts and I hope that the Federal Reserve's guidelines, which are a good step, could actually be accelerated, because waiting a year and a half to get those guidelines into place at a critical time in our economy is only buying us more and more challenges. With that, Mr. Chairman, I ask that the rest of my statement be included in the record."
"Senator Johnson","Senator Schumer, do you have a very brief statement? "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR SCHUMER"," "
"Senator Schumer","I also have a moderately brief statement, like my colleague from across the Hudson River, but I thank you for calling on me. It is an issue that I have been involved with and care about for a long time. We know how important this is. Average credit card debt for the average--the average American family has $8,500 in credit card debt on a yearly income of $52,000. That ought to make you stop and think right then and there. I have been working on this issue for a long time. When I started in the 1980s, there were two schools. Some said disclosure is enough and competition would take hold. Others said, let us put limits. I was in the former school. I said, free market, let disclosure work. I worked long and hard on legislation and the Fed and the result was something that became known as the ``Schumer Box,'' clear, concise disclosures of important credit card terms in an easy-to-read table, and it worked. Before the Schumer Box, credit card interest rates were at 19.8 percent. Every company somehow came up with the conclusion that was the exact right rate. There was no competition. The box came in and rates came down. Good old fashioned American competition did the job. So it worked. Disclosures at that point seemed to be a good balance between consumer protection and fostering business and innovation. But now, credit card companies have become so clever at inducing consumers to buy and use cards and trapping them with high interest rates and fees that I believe disclosure is no longer enough. Over the past few years, we have seen explosion of debt. The card industry began using many of the same sales tactics as mortgage brokers, below-market fees or interest rates that shoot up for the most minor of infractions, and fine print, as Senator Menendez mentioned, containing dozens of fees that a consumer has to pay. Now, recently, the Federal Reserve updated the Schumer Box. I was glad to see that. But more has to be done. Consumers are trapped in a business model that is designed to induce mistakes and jack up fees. That sums it up. And then the fees go from 7 percent to 19 percent for some minor infraction on all the debt, something is very wrong and disclosure is not enough. The type of trip-wire pricing is predatory. It has to end. One issuer went so far as to provide its customers with incorrectly addressed return envelopes to ensure that consumer payments wouldn't arrive on time and allowed the company then to charge late payment fees. That is outrageous. Other companies charge fees so often, so many fees so often, borrowers end up paying over the limit fees because their credit has been maxed out by the previous round of fees, a vicious treadmill cycle. So as I said, the Fed has made a good step, but the rule, which doesn't go into effect until July 2010, that is too far from now. Too many families are struggling to make their minimum payment. And while the Fed's intentions are now good, we cannot be too shortsighted. There is going to come another time when credit will be loose and issuers will seek to roll back some of the important protections the Fed has implemented. That is why we must legislate. I have introduced the bill on the Senate side along with my friend, Senator Udall, that Congresswoman Maloney, my colleague, has introduced and successfully passed on the House side. And I know that Senator Dodd is considering many of the points in that legislation, as many of my other colleagues' legislation, when he puts together a bill, and I hope we will move one quickly, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Johnson","Does anyone else feel absolutely compelled to make a comment?"
"Senator Reed","Can I make a very, very, very brief comment?"
"Senator Johnson","Senator Reed. "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR REED"," "
"Senator Reed","I think what my colleagues have said is that despite the first step by the Federal Reserve, we have to be very, very sensitive to the capacity and willingness of the Federal Reserve to actually protect consumers when it comes to credit cards, and I think that issue has to be before our panel and I am glad the Chairman has brought the issue to us and to this panel of witnesses. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Senator Johnson","Senator Tester? "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR TESTER"," "
"Senator Tester","I will be brief, Mr. Chairman. In the good old days, you used to take a loan and you used to pay it back. Under the current scheme that goes on with credit card companies, you take out a loan and then they start attaching fees and increasing interest rates, and by the time you get done, you are paying it back, but none of it is going to the principal. There are a lot of issues out here. My friend, Senator Brown, talked about how the college kids are being roped into this kind of thing. I just think it puts everybody in a bad boat. I think the Federal Reserve did take a first step, but it was only a first step. I look forward to working on this bill."

"STATEMENT OF ADAM J. LEVITIN, ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW, GEORGETOWN UNIVERSITY LAW CENTER"," "
"Mr. Levitin","Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Shelby, and members of the Committee. I am pleased to testify today in support of the Chairman's Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act and other legislation that would create a more efficient and fair credit card market and would encourage greater consumer responsibility in the use of credit. Credit cards are an important financial product. They offer many benefits and conveniences to consumers. But credit cards are also much more complicated than any other consumer financial product, and unnecessarily so. Auto loans, student loans, closed-end bank loans, and all but the most exotic mortgages are relatively simple. They have one or two price terms that are fixed or vary according to an index. Not so with credit cards. Credit cards have annual fees, merchant fees, teaser interest rates, purchase interest rates, balance transfer interest rates, cash advance interest rates, overdraft advance interest rates, default or penalty interest rates, late fees, over-limit fees, balance transfer fees, cash advance fees, international transaction fees, telephone payment fees, and probably several other fees of which I am unaware. In addition to these explicit price points, there are also numerous hidden fees in the form of credit card billing practices. The card industry has been ingenious in creating tricks and traps to squeeze extra revenue out of unsuspecting consumers. These billing tricks cost American families over $12 billion a year. Credit card billing tricks make cards appear to be much cheaper than they actually are, and that leads consumers to use cards too much and to use the wrong cards. By disguising the cost of using cards through billing practices, card issuers are able to maintain uncompetitively high interest rates and to generate greater use of cards. That produces additional revenue from interchange fees for the issuers as well as over-limit fees, late fees, and penalty fee revenue. The complexity of credit card pricing makes it impossible for consumers to accurately gauge the price of any particular credit card, and unless consumers can gauge the cost of using a card, they cannot use it efficiently and responsibly. Markets cannot function without transparent pricing because demand is a function of price. The lack of transparency in credit card pricing has resulted in inefficient and irresponsible use of credit, and that has resulted in dangerously over-leveraged consumers, who are paying too much for what should be a commodity product with razor-thin profit margins rather than one with a return on assets that is several multiples of other banking activities. Consumer over-leverage is a factor that should concern all of us, especially today. There is nearly a trillion dollars of credit card debt outstanding. The average carded household owed almost $11,000 in credit card debt last year. That is a drop in the bucket compared with household mortgage debt, but even the most exorbitant subprime mortgage rate is rarely over 10 percent annually, whereas the effective APR on many credit cards--the effective APR--can easily be five times as high. And the harm to families is palpable. A single repricing due to a billing trick can cost a family between an eighth and a quarter of its discretionary income. These levels of credit card debt are not sustainable. Dollar for dollar, a consumer with credit card debt is more likely to file for bankruptcy than a consumer with any other type of debt. And to the extent that consumers are servicing high-interest-rate credit card debt, that is money they cannot use to purchase new goods and services from merchants. The money siphoned off by credit card billing practices does not create value. It cannot be spent in the real economy. The card industry's arguments that Congress should not interfere with their finely calibrated risk-based pricing are malarkey. Only a very small component of credit card pricing reflects risk. Almost all credit card pricing is a function of the cost of funds, the cost of operations, and the ability-to- opportunity price, not the function of risk. Moreover, to the extent that credit card prices reflect a risk premium, it is a pool-based premium. It is not an individualized risk premium. The card industry is not capable of pricing for risk on an individual basis. The technology is not there. This means that there is inevitably subsidization of riskier consumers by more creditworthy ones. Nor is there any evidence that connects the so-called risk- based pricing to lower costs of credit for creditworthy consumers. While it is true that base interest rates have fallen, that is almost entirely a function of the lower cost of funds, and the decline in base interest rates has been offset by increases in other credit card prices. According to the GAO, for 1990 to 2005, late fees have risen an average of 160 percent, and over-limit fees have risen an average of 115 percent. Since the 1990s, credit card pricing has been a game of three-card monte. Pricing has been shifted away from the up- front, attention grabbing price points, like annual fees and base interest rates, and shifted to back-end fees that consumers are likely to ignore or underestimate. The card industry's risk-based pricing story simply doesn't hold up on the evidence and is not a reason to refrain from much-needed regulation of unfair and abusive credit card billing and pricing practices that have had a deleterious impact on the economy and society. Legislation like the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act is a crucial step in restoring transparency and fairness to the credit card market and to letting American consumers responsibly enjoy the benefits of credit cards. Thank you."
"Senator Johnson","Thank you, Mr. Levitin. The panel should know that we will limit your remarks to 5 minutes in order to have a proper question and answer period."
"Mr. Clayton?"," "
"STATEMENT OF KENNETH J. CLAYTON, SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND GENERAL COUNSEL, CARD POLICY COUNCIL, AMERICAN BANKERS ASSOCIATION"," "
"Mr. Clayton","Thank you, Senator, members of the Committee. My name is Kenneth J. Clayton, Senior Vice President and General Counsel of the ABA Card Policy Council. I appreciate the opportunity to testify today. Credit cards are responsible for more than $2.5 trillion in transactions a year and are accepted in more than 24 million locations worldwide. It is mind boggling to consider the systems needed to handle 10,000 card transactions every second around the world. It is an enormous, complicated, and expensive structure, all dedicated to delivering the efficient, safe, and easy payment vehicle we have all come to enjoy. As the credit card market has evolved to provide greater benefits and broader access, it has become more complex. As a result, legitimate concerns have been raised about the adequacy of disclosures and other regulations. In response to these concerns, the Federal Reserve and two other regulators released comprehensive rules that fundamentally change the protections offered to cardholders. In many respects, these rules reflect the input from those on this Committee and others. They have heard you. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke noted that the new rules were, and I quote, ``the most comprehensive and sweeping reforms ever adopted by the Board for credit card accounts.'' These changes have forced the complete reworking of the credit card industry's internal operations, pricing models, and funding mechanisms. As this Committee considers new restrictions on credit cards, it is important to understand the sweeping nature of the Fed's rule and the extent to which it has already addressed the core concerns of cardholders. The rule essentially eliminates many controversial card practices. For example, it eliminates the repricing of existing balances, including the use of universal default. It eliminates changes to interest rates for new balances for the first year that the card is in existence. It eliminates double-cycle billing. It eliminates payment allocation methods perceived to disadvantage customers. And it eliminates high up-front fees on subprime cards that confuse consumers over the amount of credit actually available. The rule likewise ensures that customers will have adequate time to pay their bills and adequate notice of any interest rate increase on future balances so they can act appropriately. Perhaps most importantly, the rule provides significant enhancements to credit card billing statements, applications, solicitations, and disclosures that ensure that consumers will have the information they want in a manner they will understand and in a format they will notice so they can take informed actions in their best interests. These new rules will have even broader implications for consumers, card issuers, and the general economy. The rules affect every aspect of the credit card business, from how cards are funded to how they are priced to how they are marketed and to how credit is allocated among customers with different credit histories and risk. For example, because of the limitations on the repricing of risk, the rules will reduce credit availability and increase the price of credit. The rule will also impact the ability of card lenders to fund consumer loans in the secondary market as pricing restrictions coupled with increased delinquencies in this recession make investors very wary of buying asset-backed securities backed by card receivables. These securities fund about half of all card loans, to the tune of $450 billion. This can have enormous implications for the U.S. economy going forward and it is why the Fed and Treasury are currently working hard to unlock this market. Finally, the rules will impose enormous operational challenges for card issuers. Card lenders must completely overhaul internal processes, software, billing, product lines, advertising, customer service, and a host of other internal workings. Risk management models must be completely revised. The Fed understood the enormity of this challenge and stressed that adequate time to implement it is critical to avoid significant harm to consumers, and I want to stress that last point about the harm to consumers because there is a real concern that moving the date up on some of these rules will actually end up harming the consumers more than it benefits them. In closing, we would urge that any discussion over further legislation in this area be viewed in the context of the recent Federal Reserve rule, recognizing its sweeping nature, protection to consumers, impact on operations, and most importantly, its potential impact on our broader economy and the provision of credit to consumers and small businesses. Thank you. I would be happy to answer any questions you have."
"Chairman Dodd"," Thank you very much. I appreciate your testimony and your presence here. Did you introduce all the witnesses?"

"STATEMENT OF JAMES C. STURDEVANT, PRINCIPAL, THE STURDEVANT LAW FIRM"," "
"Mr. Sturdevant","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am pleased to be here. I was here 2 years ago, in January of 2007, when you last convened a hearing on this subject. By way of background and simply to address the Federal Reserve's efforts in this regard, it began a quest in 2007, as well, with Solicitor comments. They finally came up with a set of rules late last year, but those rules won't take effect until 2010, which is why we need legislation this year and why I strongly support your legislation, Mr. Chairman. By way of background----"
"Chairman Dodd","Who is the next witness here? "
"Mr. Sturdevant","By way of background and to put the fees that have been identified both in numbers and names and amounts into some perspective, I tried two cases, one in the late 1980s and one in the early 1990s, one against Wells Fargo Bank and another against First Interstate Bank, which now no longer exists, and the issues in the case were whether or not $5 late fees and $10 over-limit fees were excessive damage amounts for a simple breach of contract by the customer. We proved to a jury in the Wells Fargo case and to an experienced judge in the First Interstate case that $5 exceeded the damages resulting from breach of contract for late payments and that $10 was $9 too much for someone who exceeded the authorized credit limit. As the Committee knows, beginning in 1996 with the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in the Smiley case, which allowed credit card companies to export anything they could charge in the home State where the credit card company was based, they could export interest rates and then, according to the Comptroller of the Currency, interest rates included late payment fees, advance fees, over-limit fees, membership fees, quick-look fees, whatever, all of these penalty fees then went from $10 or $15 to the present average level of $39. If they couldn't justify $5 or $10 in the late 1980s or early 1990s, they couldn't come close to justifying anything approximating $39 today. I was also co-lead counsel in a nationwide case against Providian Bank in the late 1990s and early years of this century. Providian's challenges were practiced from A to Z. Its entire credit card operation was abusive, predatory, and designed to lure low-income customers into situations where instead of a regular loan, they weren't paying off any of the principal. They were simply paying penalty fees, higher interest fees, balance transfer fees, et cetera. In order to stay in business, the Comptroller of the Currency required Providian to pay $300 million. The company was sued in private litigation and also by the City and County of San Francisco. And while Senator Schumer was here, he remarked on two of the then-shocking practices of Providian. One was to do a nationwide search to see where to locate its credit processing office, and they found that New Hampshire was the place where, on average, it took the longest amount of time for a letter to be mailed from any point in the country. But still, that wasn't enough to trigger enough late fee revenue at $39 a payment. They then issued bar code payment envelopes that would never reach the payment processing center in New Hampshire and were investigated on three separate occasions by the United States Postal Service for that. One can only imagine what would have appeared at trial had we not settled the case several years ago. And finally, two cases, Badie v. Bank of America, which I tried in the mid-1990s and won on appeal, and Ting v. AT&T challenged the attempts by Bank of America, on the one hand, and AT&T to impose mandatory pre-dispute arbitration clauses on their customers. In the Bank of America case, it was an attempt through a bill stuffer sent with statements which are multi- page documents and other marketing materials to alert its customers that it was replacing the civil justice system with a private system of arbitration. And then in the Ting case, we challenged AT&T's attempt to impose not only mandatory arbitration, but several different unconscionable provisions, as well, unconscionable under California law because they prohibited class-wide adjudication, they imposed a secrecy gap on the consumer, they limited remedies otherwise available in litigation. The latest abuse, revealed last week by Chase, was to send out a bill stuffer which required many of its customers to increase the minimum payment from the standard in the industry, which had been 2 percent of the balance, to 5 percent. For low- income people, an increase of 250 percent per month is more than significant and absolutely almost universally triggers default. For people at higher-income brackets, making a payment that usually was $99 a month and then trying to pay $250 a month is difficult in these financial times, as well. Chase also thought it appropriate to impose a $10 administrative fee because I think the industry had simply run out of names for the fees that it charges. I have included in my written testimony a list of the fees that Professor Levitin mentioned. Mr. Chairman, I support your bill. I support provisions of the bill introduced a year ago by Senators Levin and McCaskill. I support Congressman Maloney's bill. Consumers in this country need legislation and they need a combination of enforcement by Federal officials, by State officials, and by private litigation, where necessary, to enforce the prohibitions that I hope this Congress will enact and President Obama will sign. In closing, let me say this. Professor Elizabeth Warren from Harvard, who chairs the TARP Committee, has written a paper and advocated something akin to the Consumer Product Safety Commission for financial services, which I know you are aware of and hopefully other members. This will elevate for education purposes to consumers and to students, who Senators Brown and Tester talked about, the serious traps for the unwary that the credit card industry in its current form presents. Thank you for inviting me to testify. I would be happy to answer any questions."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I thank you very, very much. The complexity of it all for consumers is not accidental, in my view. Mr. Zywicki, thank you. "
"STATEMENT OF TODD J. ZYWICKI, PROFESSOR OF LAW, MERCATUS CENTER SENIOR SCHOLAR, GEORGE MASON UNIVERSITY SCHOOL OF LAW"," "
"Mr. Zywicki","Mr. Chairman and members of the Committee, it is a pleasure to appear before you today. Let me make clear at the outset, I have no relationship with the credit card industry. I fight with them just like everybody else does. I disagree with them, just like any other company from which I buy goods and services, and you may find this hard to believe, but sometimes I even disagree with my elected representatives on various issues. And I am really quite ruthless and not the slightest bit sentimental about leaving one card and switching to another if a better deal comes along. I don't care whether the industry makes a lot of money or a little bit of money. What I care about is maximizing consumer choice and maximizing competition in a manner that will be consumer welfare-enhancing, and I fear there are many provisions in this legislation that may have unintended consequences that will lead to higher interest rates for consumers, will stifle market and regulatory innovation, and will restrict consumer access to credit at a particularly inopportune time. Unlike almost any other good or service, credit card issuers are forced to compete for my loyalty every time I pull out my wallet to make a payment. I have got four credit cards. I decide at any given time which one is the best one for me to use, whether I am buying gasoline or shopping online. In such a competitive environment, credit card issuers face relentless competition to retain my loyalty, and as I said, I am not the slightest bit sentimental about switching if a better deal comes along. Federal Reserve surveys indicate that 90 percent of credit card owners report that they are very or somewhat satisfied with their credit cards, versus 5 percent who are somewhat dissatisfied and only 1 percent, that is one out of 100, who say that they are very dissatisfied with their credit cards. Moreover, two-thirds of respondents in a Federal Reserve survey also reported that credit card companies usually provide enough information to enable them to use credit cards wisely, and 73 percent stated that the option to revolve balances on their credit cards made it easier to manage their finances, versus 10 percent who said this made it more difficult. So let us not throw out the baby with the bath water. Nonetheless, the myriad uses of credit cards and the increasing heterogeneity of credit card owners has spawned increasingly complexity in credit card terms and concerns about confusion that may reduce consumer welfare. Nonetheless, we should not sacrifice just for the sake of making credit card simpler some of the benefits that we have generated from credit cards. Consider some of the more troubling provisions in the legislation to my mind. First, there are some provisions that will likely lead to higher interest rates and other costs for consumers. For instance, and many of these are in the Federal Reserve rules but I still am troubled by them, and to the extent that they are phased in rather than posed immediately, I believe that will be better for consumers. First, for instance, it prohibits the application of any rate increases on an outstanding balance on credit cards, often called retroactive rate increases. The way credit cards operate is they are revolving credit. They are month-to-month loans. That means at any given time, I can cancel my card and go to a lower interest rate card. To the extent that issuers are unable to raise the interest rate when situations change but I am allowed to switch to a lower interest rate when situations change, the end result of that is that issuers are going to be less likely to offer lower interest rates on the front end. If I can lower my interest rate but it can't be raised if circumstances change, they are going to be less likely to offer lower rate interest cards. Second, the provision that has to do with application on outstanding balances suffers from the same sort of problem. Second, I am concerned that some of the things in this legislation will stifle innovation. For instance, the provision that requires an ongoing payoff, a timing disclosure that includes, for instance, a statement to the consumers how long it would take to pay off the card balance by only making the minimum payment. This would go on every billing statement. According to research by Federal Reserve economist Thomas Durkin, this provision would be of interest to approximately 4 percent of credit card users, being those who intend to pay off their balance by making the minimum payment and intend to stop using the card. It is an open question whether or not it is worth mandating a brand new disclosure for 4 percent of consumers, much less one that would be conspicuously disclosed. Why is that a problem? Because the more things that you require to be disclosed and the bigger you require it to be disclosed, the more distracting and more difficult it becomes for consumers to find out what they actually want. More fundamentally, I think this illustrates a one-size- fits-all strategy to consumer protection that is not accurate in the context of credit cards. The reason why credit cards are so complicated today is because consumer use of credit cards is so multi-faceted. Consumer cards offer an endless array of terms that respond to the endless array of demands of different consumers. Some consumers never revolve. Some consumers revolve sometimes. Some consumers revolve all the time. I never revolve. I have no idea what my credit card interest rate is. I don't care. I don't shop for a card on those terms. I care about what my annual fee is and what my benefits are. To the extent that we mandate certain disclosures, it makes it more difficult for consumers to shop on the terms that they actually want, and the empirical evidence on this is clear. Consumers do shop on the terms that they want. Those who revolve, unlike me, do know what their interest rate is, by and large, and they shop very aggressively on that. The best evidence we have is that those who revolve balances actually have a lower interest rate on their credit card than those like me who don't pay interest and so don't shop on that particular term. To the extent, then, that we also place limits on penalty fees and that sort of thing, we are going to reduce risk-based pricing by requiring interest rate raises for everybody else. The final thing I would like to close on is the concern that this might reduce credit access. We know what has happened during this past year as credit card access has dried up and credit limits have declined. Reports indicate that middle- class--some people have been forced to go without things they wanted. Other reports indicate that those who are unable to get credit cards have been, for instance, forced to turn to layaway plans. They brought back layaway this fall because people couldn't get credit cards. Other people have had to turn to payday lenders. Other middle-class people have turned to pawn shops. To the extent that the impact of this law is to reduce access to credit, it will harm those who we intend to help, and in particular, I would urge caution, although it is obvious college students often misuse credit cards, I would urge caution at this particular time at doing things that might limit access to credit for college students. We know that the student loan markets are not performing very well right now either, and we know that a lot of college students drop out when they can't get access to credit. So it may be that on net, some of those are appropriate, so let us not be overzealous in a way that might lead to reduced access to credit. Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much."
"Dr. Ausubel"," "
"STATEMENT OF LAWRENCE M. AUSUBEL, PROFESSOR OF ECONOMICS, UNIVERSITY OF MARYLAND"," "
"Mr. Ausubel","Good morning, Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and members of the Committee, and thank you for inviting me here. My name is Lawrence Ausubel. I am a professor of economics at the University of Maryland and the author of perhaps the most cited article on credit cards in the scholarly literature. Penalty interest rates or risk-based pricing, this is the question of the day. Consumer advocates assert that when the typical issuer raises the credit card interest rate by 12 to 15 percent following a late payment, this is penalty pricing intended to take revenues from their most vulnerable customers. However, industry representatives respond that consumers who miss payments are the most likely to eventually default and all they are doing is requiring the riskiest consumers to shoulder their true cost. My testimony will seek to address which characterization is more accurate. The consumer view would justify legislation, such as the Dodd bill, while the industry view would suggest that such rules are misplaced. Unfortunately, the data necessary to answer this question are typically confidential and out of reach. However, in 2008, Morrison and Foerster issued a data study on behalf of lenders which tracks various delinquency events such as going 16 to 30 days past due or going three or more days past due on two separate occasions, and it reports the percentage of consumers who ultimately default. Using their reported numbers, one can perform simple back-of-the-envelope calculations that answer the question of the day. The data enable me to reach the conclusion that the increases in interest rates bear no reasonable relation to default risk, i.e., these are penalty interest rates that demand regulation. Here is a simple calculation. Accounts that were 16 to 30 days past due in May 2006 experienced higher defaults than accounts that were current. Twenty-point-seven percent of these balances went into default, as defined by the study, over the following 22 months as compared to 9.3 percent for accounts that were current. Converting these percentages into annual rates of net credit losses gives an increased economic loss per year of 4.5 percent. However, the standard repricing in the marketplace is a 12 percent to 15 percent increase. Let me repeat that. Economic loss of 4.5 percent versus standard repricing of 12 to 15 percent. This is three times greater. By any standard, this is penalty pricing, not risk-based pricing. Moreover, this calculation is overly generous to the industry in several respects. For example, the data study omits late fees, typically $39, which are imposed above and beyond the interest rate increases. Further, to be more than fair, I selected 16 to 30 days late as my selection criterion. Using a trigger of just two to 5 days late, as some banks do, one can get the economic loss down below 2.5 percent per year. And again, the standard increase is 12 to 15 percent. At the end of the day, the economic conclusion is inescapable that these are penalties based not on cost, but on demand factors, and observe that the demand of consumers facing penalty rates is rather inelastic. They are often borrowed up, distressed, and have diminished alternative borrowing opportunities. I should also emphasize that a retroactive penalty rate increase for distressed consumers is precisely the opposite policy prescription that we apply in other areas of lending. For example, there is a growing consensus today that in the mortgage area, loan modification, i.e., reductions as opposed to penalties, are needed. To summarize, economic analysis of recent data supports stricter regulation of the credit card industry, particularly with respect to penalty interest rates imposed on existing balances. The Fed has taken some action in this area, but regrettably, the regulations are weak and the effective date is not until July 1, 2010. The current economic crisis makes it all the more urgent that Congress adopt the Dodd bill sooner. So to close, Chairman Dodd, I support the bill you introduced yesterday."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Doctor. I appreciate that very much. Travis Plunkett has been before the Committee on numerous occasions with the Consumer Federation of America. We thank you for being here. "
"STATEMENT OF TRAVIS B. PLUNKETT, LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR, CONSUMER FEDERATION OF AMERICA"," "
"Mr. Plunkett","Thank you, Chairman Dodd, members of the Committee. I am Travis Plunkett, the Legislative Director at the Consumer Federation of America. I am testifying today on behalf of CFA and five other national consumer organizations. I appreciate the opportunity to offer our analysis of the very serious national consequences that unfair and deceptive credit card practices are having on many families in this recession as well as what this Committee can do to stop these traps and tricks. American families cannot become the engine of economic recovery if they are burdened by high credit card debt that can further escalate at a creditor's whim. I would like to summarize five points that I will leave with the Committee and then come back at the end of my testimony and provide a little detail on each point. First, the number of families in trouble with their credit card loans is approaching historic highs, as Senator Dodd said. Based on loss trends the card issuers are reporting, 2009 could be one of the worst years on record for credit card consumers. Second point, credit card issuers share a great deal of responsibility for putting so many Americans in such a vulnerable financial position through their reckless extension of credit over a number of years and use of abusive and unjustified pricing practices, which seem to be accelerating at this time when consumers can least afford it. Third, the need for quick action to end abusive lending practices is more urgent than ever now because taxpayers are propping up major credit card issuers through several enormously expensive programs. If the government is going to attempt to spur credit card issuers to offer more credit, it must ensure that the loans they are offering now are fair and sustainable. Fourth, the recent credit card rule finalized by the Federal regulators is a good first step in curbing abusive practices. It does have significant gaps, though, and as we have heard, it doesn't take effect until July of 2010. Fifth, Senator Dodd's comprehensive Credit Card Act fills in many of these gaps, as do a number of other legislative proposals that have been offered by members of this Committee. It will make the credit card marketplace fairer, more competitive, and more transparent. So let us talk a little detail here. On loss trends, Senator Dodd went through some of the most worrisome factors. One thing to watch is something industry insiders look at a lot. It is called the payoff rate. This is the amount of money that credit card consumers pay on their credit card bill every month and it has just dropped at the end of last year precipitously for credit cards. It is now at one of the lowest levels ever reported, showing that cardholders are having a harder time affording their bills and that the amount of money they can pay every month is dropping. Charge-offs and delinquencies--charge-offs is the amount of money proportionate to how much is loaned that credit card issuers write off as uncollectible--it is looking like they may approach the highest levels ever by the end of this year, and they are already quite high and have shot up very fast. Personal bankruptcy is up by about a third. On the responsibility that issuers have for this problem, just so you don't think this is last year's news or old news, let me just cite a few recent problems with some of the pricing practices you have heard about. They involve issuers adding new fees, increasing the amount of fees that they are charging, using harmful rather than responsible methods to lower credit lines, and a number of other abusive practices. Citigroup last fall back-pedaled on its promise to note increase interest rates any-time for any-reason, and then increased interest rates on a large part of their portfolio. Chase, as we have heard, has suddenly started charging people $120 a year for their accounts. These are cardholders who were promised a fixed rate for the life of their balance. Bank of America has used a variety of questionable methods for cardholders who appear to have done nothing wrong to violate their agreement, citing risk-based pricing and not providing clear information to these cardholders about the problem. Capital One and a number of other issuers over the last year, year and a half, have used very vague clauses in the cardholder agreements that allow them to increase interest rates for large parts of their portfolio for so-called market conditions. Let me be clear. Issuers do have the right to try and limit their losses in a recession, but these kinds of arbitrary and unjustified practices for cardholders who thought they were playing by the rules are very, very harmful. On the need for quick action because of government support, a couple of days ago, Treasury Secretary Geithner announced the expansion of a program that is supposed to provide taxpayer dollars to support securitization of credit card loans. They want more credit card lending. We have urged the Secretary to establish minimum fair practices standards for credit cards now so that our tax money isn't supporting unfair loans. On the Federal Reserve and regulator credit card rule, several positive aspects that we have heard about to the rule related to double-cycle billing, restrictions on increasing interest rates on existing balances, payment allocation. There are gaps, though. Fees are not addressed at all. Credit extension is not addressed at all. Bringing down rates if cardholders say they have a problem, then they pay on time for, say, 6 months, not addressed. And as we have heard, it doesn't take effect for a long time. The Credit Card Act and a number of other bills introduced in the Senate address many of these gaps. No any-time, any- reason repricing. That is the excuse Chase used. Limiting unjustified penalty fees by requiring that fees be reasonably related to the cost issuers incur, a very important part of the Credit Card Act. Limiting aggressive marketing and irresponsible lending to young consumers and lowering rates if consumers perform well after a problem occurs. Let me just close by saying that we have heard a lot about fears that fair regulation of the credit card market will lead to less credit, will lead to people who need it not having access to credit, especially lower-income or minority consumers. I always get a little worried because this context, or the context for this discussion is to ignore what has happened through essentially self-regulation of the market. I mean, where are we now? Issuers have been able to write their own rules for a very long time and they are cutting back on credit, especially to more vulnerable borrowers, especially to lower-income and minority borrowers. Plus, we have to deal with the kind of uncompetitive, not transparent marketplace we have heard about. So it sounds like the worst of all possible worlds to me, and that is why we support Senator Dodd's bill and fair regulation of the marketplace."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and I appreciate your comments, and all of you here this morning for your counsel on this issue, which is, again, a complex one and one that deserves our attention. I want to also make two points. One is credit cards are a tremendously valuable and worthwhile tool for consumers. I think it is very important. This is not a Committee, or at least an individual here that is hostile to the notion of credit cards at all. Quite the contrary. Second, I respect immensely that Ben Bernanke and the Federal Reserve moved on the issue of regulation, and while there are gaps and problems I have with what they have done, he is the first Chairman of the Fed that has actually moved in this area, despite the issue having been raised for a long time, and I certainly want to reflect my appreciation for the steps they have taken. I am disappointed that you have got to wait until July of 2010 for them to become effective, but nonetheless I want the record to reflect it. I was very impressed, Mr. Levitin, with this study and I highly recommend to my colleagues. It is lengthy in some ways. It is a number of pages long, some 20 pages long, this analysis of the credit card industry and how it works. But one thing that struck me at the outset of the report is something I think we kind of blow through, and that is the credit instruments that we use as Americans are tremendously valuable--the home mortgage, the car loan, the student loan. And the point that you make, or that this report makes is, of course, the pricing points, and I think it is a very worthwhile point to make. In almost every one of these other transactions, pricing points are rather clear. They are one or two or three, maybe four, but you have a pretty clear idea. You know with almost certainty what your mortgage is going to be, what your car payments are going to be, what your other payments are regardless if you take credit. When you get into this area, it is exactly the opposite, and I was stunned at the pricing points and why, in terms of taking on this responsibility, knowing what your responsibilities are going to be, you are faced with the following, just on pricing points, an astounding array of points--annual fees, merchant fees, teaser interest rates, base interest rates, balance transfer interest rates, cash advance interest rates, overdraft interest rates, default interest rates, late fees, over-limit fees, balance transfer fees, cash advance fees, international transaction fees, telephone payment fees. These are all the pricing points in credit card negotiations. To expect a consumer to appreciate and absorb that many pricing points when you are trying to determine whether or not taking on that financial responsibility--now, again, we are not going to eliminate all of these, but the idea that a consumer is able to juggle and understand that many different pricing points when you are making a determination as to whether or not you ought to engage in a service or a product purchase. I was stunned, as well, on the issues of bankruptcy and the like in terms of driving these costs up and the complexity of dealing with it. Again, I draw my colleagues' attention to this report. I think it is extremely useful. It gets into the issue of the risk-based pricing issue, as well, that Dr. Ausubel referenced, but I think it is an important point, as well. It is an industry that started out making its money on interest rates, and that was where the money was made. It has transferred itself from interest rates to fees, and that is the $12 billion increase in fees that have occurred that have added so much cost and confusion. Mr. Clayton, thank you for being here. One of the issues that is obviously of concern to many of us is the universal default. I think most people understand it, but the idea that if you are current on your credit card responsibilities, but if you are late on an electrical bill or a phone bill or the like, that we have seen examples where the issuers will then raise fees or rates as a result of your late payments on unrelated responsibilities, financial responsibilities. Now, it is true that, in a sense, the new rule to some degree eliminates the universal default. But under the rule, as well, and having conversations with the Fed about this, issuers can still look to off-comp behavior to increase interest rates. And so while it talks about banning it on one hand, it still tolerates the issue of actually accounting for off-balance behavior to increase rates that consumers pay. I would still call that universal default. If, in fact, the issuer can raise rates by considering these late payments in unrelated matters to the credit card, then it still seems to me that universal default exists. How do you respond to that?"
"Mr. Clayton","Well, Senator, I know there has always been this discussion about how universal default is defined and I understand respect the fact that people take different perspectives. But it is our understanding that the Fed permits the changing of interest rates on existing balances under four conditions and four conditions alone. The first condition is if it is a promotional rate card, essentially, and it is disclosed ahead of time and that promotional rate expires. The second one is if it is a variable rate card tied to some kind of index. The third one is if there is a delinquency in excess of 30 days. And the fourth one is if it is a violation of a work-out agreement. I am unaware of any other circumstance where, when this rule becomes effective, that institutions can consider off- account information in determining the interest rate on that existing balance."
"Chairman Dodd","Mr. Sturdevant, do you have any comment on this, or any of you who are familiar with it?"
"Mr. Sturdevant","I am concerned about the Federal Reserve's rule, particularly in light of your comments, not simply today, but 2 years ago about this very issue, and in terms of consumer expectations under agreements that now exceed 30 pages in length about what they are getting when they get a credit card. I mean, I think Senator Tester is right, and you were right, Mr. Chairman, on auto loans. You know what you are getting. You know what you are paying. In the old days of banking, they loaned the money out and they took deposits in. We don't do that anymore. And the problem with universal default is consumers do not understand that if they have a problem with a utility bill or some other relationship, that the interest rate is going to skyrocket, that the penalty fees are going to be imposed. That is what universal default does. It is a complete trap for the unwary and it needs to be prohibited, not regulated."
"Mr. Plunkett","Senator, to answer your question, universal default would be allowed prospectively. The Federal Reserve rule deals with increases on existing balances."
"Chairman Dodd","But not going forward?"
"Mr. Plunkett","But not going forward. So they could decide that they didn't like my library fines or my utility payment and increase my--you know, send me a notice saying that going forward, as long as they met other requirements of the law----"
"Chairman Dodd","Despite the fact that you are absolutely current. What I am suggesting, if you are late and various things, under reasonable rules, having fees and penalties and so forth. We are not talking about that. We are assuming that that consumer is absolutely current in their payments on their credit card responsibility, and then still because they are late on some other charges, that then justifies increasing the rates on that consumer going forward."
"Mr. Plunkett","Our reading of the rule is that that would be allowed going forward."
"Chairman Dodd","Can you imagine the effect it would have if you were late on your credit card and the phone company or the electrical company decided, we are going to increase your rates because you didn't pay your credit card on time? What would be the reaction? Do you have a comment?"
"Mr. Clayton","Senator, can I jump in for a second? First of all, card companies don't consider whether you are late on a telephone bill or utility bill as part of what is in their credit records. The other thing is that consumers have absolute control here. This is about future balances. And I would note, by the way, that the Fed said that you cannot increase future balances for the first year of the card. That is the first thing. Plus they gave you notice of that effect. And it gives you the choice of walking. If you don't like what the card company is doing, there is a lot of competition out there and choice for people, and that is the ultimate controlling mechanism here. Consumers can just say no. And it is not that hard and we need----"
"Chairman Dodd","Why do you have to--why all these fees and rates and so forth? Is that really the answer to consumers? If you don't like this, what we are loading you up with and charging these fees, just take a walk?"
"Mr. Clayton","Well, but that is what you do every time when you walk by and decide whether you are going to buy a sweater in a store or not. But the other thing that is important to note that gets lost in this, credit cards, while they are loans, are fundamentally different. They are not secured. They are completely used with incredible flexibility for consumers at any time. You can use it 24/7 virtually anywhere in the globe. There is a huge amount of risk in making those loans available. What we worry about, and we understand are sympathetic to the concerns being raised, the Fed has acted and we will obviously enforce that with all the strength we can. But the point is----"
"Chairman Dodd","So the comments are coming then in favor of the Fed rules?"
"Mr. Clayton","We didn't necessarily agree with everything the Fed said, but it is the rule of law today and it is what we will have to comply with going forward and we will do our best to----"
"Chairman Dodd","Are you in favor of them?"
"Mr. Clayton","There are concerns that people have raised about the impact it will have on availability of credit."
"Chairman Dodd","My time is up. Let me turn to Senator Corker. I have extended my time."
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you for having the hearing. I am going to be very brief. I have got something starting in about 3 minutes. But let me just, Mr. Clayton, I just recently met with a number of folks that are in the credit card business and I got the sense that it wasn't a particularly rosy time. Could you give us a sense as to how the industry itself right now is performing from the standpoint of making profits, losing money, just generally the state of the credit card issuers' business today?"
"Mr. Clayton","Sure. Credit card issuers are subject to the same economic influences that are out there affecting everyday consumers and every other lender in the country. Card companies are under particular stress right now. A number of them are losing money and have indicated in recent reports significant losses on their card portfolios, which actually reflects the underlying risk of this product. I mean, people talk about how much consumers are getting in debt or can't pay it back. Well, lenders who make loans to those people are the ones at risk here of not getting paid. So there is a significant amount of stress right now."
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I have got two daughters that are in college and every time we have a hearing or some discussion about credit cards, I literally call them that day-- the credit card industry won't like this--to make sure they do not have a credit card, OK, that they have only a debit card or a check card. So I actually appreciate many of the fears that people and many of the concerns that people have laid out today regarding the credit card companies. I have to tell you, I feel like I am semi-sophisticated-- semi--and I get incredibly confused by all these things I get in the mail, and candidly, throw most of them in the trash. I just don't understand. So the marketing practices, I think, are things that need to be looked at. So the only thing I would say is that we have this rule of unintended consequences that continues to sort of haunt us with actions that we take. While I think that certainly there have been abuses in fairness, at the same time, I think we have to be very careful. It seems that when we do things like this, in many cases, it is the lowest-income people that end up getting hurt the worst by our good efforts by virtue of having a lack of availability of credit. So I hope as we move through this, we will do this in a balanced way that does take into account some of the concerns that have been raised and I think are very fair. But at the same time, we understand that at the end of the day, these businesses are going to do those things in their self-interest, and when they do that, it may, in fact, end up harming the very people that this legislation is intended to help. So thank you very much for this great hearing."
"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate that very much, Senator. We always appreciate that point. It is a worthwhile one. This is an ongoing issue. I just say regarding young people and unsolicited mail, I have a 3-year-old that got a credit card the other day and they wanted to thank her for her wonderful performance as a consumer. She is a delightful consumer, I want you to know that, but the idea that she warrants a credit card at the age of three is troubling, needless to say. And the idea of having some ability to demonstrate you can pay or some cosponsorship, I think these are basic things that one would require. Let me stop there."
"Senator Johnson?",""
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Plunkett, the new Fed rules prohibit banks from increasing interest rates on credit card debt that a consumer has already accrued, increase the amount of time consumers have to make payments, change how a consumer's balance is computed each billing cycle, ensure that consumer payments go first to balances with the highest interest rates, and crack down on credit cards with low credit limits and APs. What other areas would you like to see improvements regarding consumer protections for credit cards?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Thank you for the question, Senator. A couple more areas we would like to see improvements. First, as we heard, fees have been growing faster than the cost of living. In many cases, penalty fees in particular seem to bear no relationship to the costs incurred by issuers if somebody pays late or goes over limit. So we like Senator Dodd's provision that fees should be reasonably related to the costs incurred by issuers. We like the provisions in that bill and others related to lending to young people. Two things there. Senator Dodd talked about extending credit responsibly to young people or having a cosigner with income who can pay for the loan and not offering the loan to young people without much income. The second issue in the bill, give young people a choice of whether they want to accept--a real choice--whether they want to accept credit card solicitations. So the bill has an opt in. You don't get solicited between 18 and 21 unless you affirmatively choose to allow it. A third issue is bringing down rates after somebody makes a mistake. In many cases, issuers appear to be reserving the right to charge those rates for a long time, you know, many, many, many months. What the Dodd bill says is after 6 months, if you have been on time, if you haven't violated your agreement, rates have to come back down again."
"Senator Johnson","I believe the time is incorrect."
"Chairman Dodd","Just keep going."
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Clayton, I understand that the Fed's rules are not effective until July 2010. We have heard from some that this is too long and that legislation needs to be passed now to shorten this to a few months. Why do you think the Fed gives the industry so much time to put the rules in place?"
"Mr. Clayton","Thank you, Senator. One of the things that the staff and the regulators were careful to articulate when they issued this rule was the immensity of what was involved in changing what they are requiring. There are significant operational changes in terms of everything under the sun, in terms of how banks actually send out billing statements, how they coordinate, how they do anything that you see in paper has to be obviously tested, because there are significant compliance concerns that go with this and significant penalties for failure to get it right. They also have to significantly rewrite how they price for risk because the rule places significant limitations on that. And as a practical matter, that takes time to figure out what is acceptable to consumers as well as what is acceptable to regulators and others. The third point, and this is something I wanted to stress, is the funding aspect of this. As others have noted and I have tried to note in my testimony, the credit card industry and consumers are essentially dependent on funding from investors. Half of the credit card funding that is provided for credit card loans comes out of the asset-backed securities market. It is why, in fact, the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve are trying to come up with a way to unlock that market because it is currently locked right now. The problem is, those securities were issued with the expectation by investors that there could be a risk-based repricing in the process, and so it has built into the models of those securities that people will actually pay back at certain rates and that the institutions have the right to change those rates in order to compensate for higher risk in the marketplace. If you move this date up, in addition to all the operational headaches you run, you are going to end up changing the nature of that calculation and reducing the ability of credit card companies to meet the requirements of those securities. As a result, investors start running. They get nervous. They won't purchase it going forward, which actually operates in direct conflict with what the Treasury and the Fed are trying to do in unlocking this market, and it runs the risk in the worst case scenario, and we are not saying this happens, that some of these trusts have to be devolved. What that means is the hundreds of billions of dollars of repurchases back off from these receivables and you have to hold tens of billions of dollars in capital against that. That will significantly contract the availability of credit in the marketplace."
"Senator Johnson","Mr. Ausubel, in recent months, we have seen lenders cut back the amount of new credit that they offer and reduce credit card lines. How has this impacted consumers?"
"Mr. Ausubel","Clearly, the financial crisis has led to the reduction in credit lines and this has been adverse to consumers. However, there is no evidence that credit card regulation or the Dodd bill would cause any further contraction in the availability of credit or increase the cost of credit. This has all been presented as industry rhetoric with no hard evidence. The other thing just to add is people are using things-- this is always done--people are using random recent events, like the cutback in the securitization market--I should say the freezing of the securitization market to raise red flags here. The reason for the securitization market's freeze is the financial crisis and it is not a matter of concern whether banks can impose penalty rates on consumers."
"Senator Johnson","Thank you. I yield back."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much."
"Senator Reed?",""
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Following on Senator Johnson's question about this 18-month interval, just to be clear, Mr. Clayton, is there anything in the rules that would prevent credit card issuers from raising interest rates and increasing fees in that 18-month period?"
"Mr. Clayton","No."
"Senator Reed","Would there be an incentive to do so if these fees can be maintained after 18 months?"
"Mr. Clayton","Not necessarily, because ultimately the card companies have to answer to the marketplace, and if they raise rates, there is always the opportunity for consumers to take it to another company. So it is not-- credit card companies are not in the business of hurting their customers. Ultimately, they want them for the long term and long-term profit. So they are not looking to drive people away. If there are choices in the marketplace to provide a better deal, they know the consumers will take it."
"Senator Reed","Professor Levitin, what is the spread between the rates here? What is this price competition that Mr. Clayton has referred to that goes on so vigorously?"
"Mr. Levitin","Well, here is the problem with Mr. Clayton's story. It is that he is saying you can just say no. If a consumer doesn't like a prospective rate increase, the consumer can walk away. But that is not costless. There is a lot of lock-in with credit cards. If you want to walk away from a card because you don't like what the issuer is doing, it is not that simple. You have to go and find a new card. That takes some time. There are some transaction costs there, not high, but there are some, and you take a hit to your credit report. If you have a line of credit that was functioning just fine and you close it, that hurts your credit score. Walking away is not costless, and I believe Professor Ausubel has a study on this and I should defer to him for a characterization of it, but if I recall, I think he estimated the costs of switching a card being around $150 in total costs to a consumer."
"Senator Reed","Before I go to the Professor, just a response to my initial question. There is no disincentive to raising rates, and another particular question, there are certain categories of fees or charges that are prohibited after the 18- month period. If those fees or charges exist on that date for card customers, will they stay in effect or would they have to be conformed?"
"Mr. Levitin","Regarding your second question, I am not sure. Regarding the first question, there really is no disincentive for raising the cost because if you have a consumer who is locked in, if you raise their rates some--I mean, consider this. Right now, consumers can already walk away, but yet we see Citibank going and raising interest rates. On one of my Citi credit cards, Citi raised the rate. It went up--it was a 70-percent increase, seven-zero percent. Citi had to be calculating that I wasn't going to walk away. Now, that card is way above the rate that I have from other cards, but the idea that Citi wouldn't do this, I mean, if Citi is smart and if banks are self-interested, as Mr. Clayton says, they wouldn't do this unless they know that I am not going to walk away, that they know that there is a serious lock-in effect. And that is why I don't think we are going to see that going forward the Fed rules are going to help us much."
"Senator Reed","Well, let me----"
"Mr. Plunkett","Senator, on your second question----"
"Senator Reed","Mr. Plunkett, please."
"Mr. Plunkett","I think the understanding is that the rule is prospective. So the baseline will be what issuers are doing at the time the rule takes effect in 17 months and it will not be retroactive in any way. It will affect behavior from that point on."
"Senator Reed","Let me ask another question. So a new customer comes online. They would still be subjected to the same policies and practices, just essentially grandfathered, even though they have come online after 2010?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Well, going--on July 1, 2010, no matter when the customer comes on, they will be prohibited from certain things, like raising interest rates on existing balances if somebody is--unless somebody is more than 30 days late."
"Senator Reed","OK. But that existing interest rate is the baseline starting in 2010?"
"Mr. Plunkett","Yes, sir."
"Senator Reed","Professor Ausubel, Professor Levitin referred to your study. Could you comment?"
"Mr. Ausubel","Sure. One thing just to say on that last point is I do have serious concerns that issuers might exercise their prerogative under their any-time, any-reason clauses on June 30, 2010, to raise interest rates on existing balances. As far as what Professor Levitin referred to, it is well established in the economics literature that consumers are subject to what are variously called search costs and switch costs. Search cost means the expense in time, resources of finding a better deal. Switch cost simply means the expense in time and resource of switching over, say, to a new card issuer. If you actually look at consumer-level data, consumers behave as if these search costs and switch costs are quite large. Part of it is that it does take a while to restructure your financial affairs and move to a cheaper lender. Another thing that comes up is simply consumers behave as if they are, you might say, overly optimistic. So they have a $3,000 balance right now, but sure, I am going to pay it off in a few months so the interest rate differential doesn't matter that much and I don't put as much effort into it."
"Senator Reed","Let me, if I may, a final question. If there is data out there, Professor, there is a search cost, but if the interest rate is not significantly lower, people make a rough calculation that those search costs are too expensive, what is the differential rate between Card A, Card B, and Card C? Again, I ask this because I don't know. It just strikes me as that most of these cards sort of parallel consciousness seem to have similar rate structures, similar terms, and maybe there is some differential, and I ask this because I don't know the answer, not to be rhetorical."
"Mr. Ausubel","I would say in terms of the basic deal, there is a lot of similarity. I think what they are referring to is, say, take a consumer who has triggered a penalty rate. So it may be that they have access to credit card offers which end up having ongoing rates of 10 percent, 12 percent, and it might be because they were 5 days late on a repayment. Their existing issuer is charging them 26 percent. So that is where you are going to find the largest differentials."
"Senator Reed","But if they switch, the information of their default goes with them, or will it catch up with them?"
"Mr. Ausubel","Yes and no, and it looks like Travis might add to what I say. If it is triggered by less than 30 days past due, I believe that standard practice is that that is not reported to credit bureaus so it might not be obvious. On the other hand, if it is triggered by certain other things, including universal default, they had to learn about it some way, other issuers would learn about it the same way."
"Senator Reed","Mr. Plunkett?"
"Mr. Plunkett","That is correct, Senator, and the obvious point here is if there is a record on a credit report, for example, somebody is more than 30 days late or there is another issue with their credit report that would allow the issuer to use universal default to reprice them, they are not going to switch in this climate. They are not going to be able to switch. It is going to be much harder. Issuers are being much more cautious and their ability to change cards will be very limited."
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for going over."
"Chairman Dodd","Not at all. Senator Bennet, Michael?"
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just have a couple questions about interchange fees, and maybe for Mr. Plunkett and Mr. Clayton. The first question is, is there a way that I, as a card user, know what interchange fee is being charged by my credit card company or imposed on the merchants from whom I am buying products?"
"Mr. Levitin","It is impossible to know that as a consumer. The interchange fee schedules are incredibly complex. You would have to know what category your card falls in out of several categories. You would have to know what category a merchant falls in under several categories. So is the merchant considered a grocery store or is it considered a warehouse club, or is it considered a gas station or a restaurant? Some of these are fairly simple to figure out, some are not. Then you would have to know within those how much business the merchant does. So grocery stores that do over some hundred million dollars of business have a different rate than those that do less. And then you don't know what kind of--for a few very large merchants like Wal-Mart, they are able to get a sweetheart deal by basically being put in a special interchange category. There is really no way of knowing what costs you are imposing on the merchant. What is important to note, though, is interchange means that it is not free to use a credit card. If you are a pure transactor like Professor Zywicki, there is still a cost for using the credit card. There is no free lunch here. You go to a merchant and you make a purchase with the card, and let us say the interchange rate is 2 percent on that card. That is 2 percent for what we should assume is really about a 15-day extension of credit. You make most--maybe your purchases on average are made in the middle of the month, so you have the extension of credit to the end of the month. On 2 percent for a 15-day extension of credit as an APR, it puts you at something around 52 percent APR. There is a real cost for just using a card to transact, even if you aren't borrowing, and that is not a cost that is apparent to consumers because it is passed on to merchants in what is called the merchant discount fee and merchants are not allowed by credit card network rules to pass that on to card consumers. So people who are using credit cards, and especially people who are using fancy, high-cost credit cards are being subsidized by other consumers. They are being subsidized by people who use cash, by people who pay with checks, by people who pay with Food Stamps, and that is a really inequitable subsidization."
"Senator Bennet","I want to come back to that in a second, and I want to give Mr. Clayton a chance to respond, but is there a way, and anybody can answer this, but given how opaque that is and untransparent that is, are there things we could do to address that issue so that consumers and merchants have the information?"
"Mr. Zywicki","Well, it is a more--Senator, it is a more general issue. There are costs to every payment mechanism. There are interchange fees for credit cards. There are check clearing fees when you write a check that we are not aware of. There are costs to print currency when we use money."
"Senator Bennet","Let us stick with credit cards, though."
"Mr. Zywicki","So we have a general sort of problem with respect to consumers who never bear the full cost of whatever their payment mechanism is. And so I would ask the question, if we are going to insist on making it more transparent for credit cards, should we also make it more transparent when you write a check or when you use a dollar bill, the full cost that goes into processing those transactions, and how exactly would consumers be better off? It is not clear to me that consumers would be better off if we forced revelation of that information for every payment device that they use."
"Senator Bennet","I don't know, maybe we should, but I think that what I have heard from the small businesses in my State is that this is an enormous cost of doing business. Obviously, the convenience of having customers use credit cards is important to them, as well. But when we are talking about the consumers being able to make choices in a marketplace and some of the most important information is actually obscure to them and there is not any way in the present environment for them to know what the true cost really is, I think that is a problem. And so I would like to come back to how we would address it, but Mr. Clayton, maybe you would like to respond."
"Mr. Clayton","Yes, Senator. There are so many issues in there we would be glad to have further conversations with you when time allows for a little bit more conversation, but essentially interchange is a cost of doing business. It is not really any different than the cost of labor, than the cost of turning on the lights, than the cost of paying for cash registers and the like. And as a practical matter, if you want to disclose all of that to consumers, you can do that. But it is inherent to the business and it is not any different than that. What we are really seeing here is, and this is our perspective, obviously, and not shared by the merchant community, but the merchant community trying to transfer the costs of this off of their backs and onto the consumers, because as a frank matter, this is something that provides enormous benefit. It provides ticket lift, which means more purchases coming for a merchant. It provides a great deal of security. Remember, as soon as that card is swiped through the machine, all of a sudden, the risk of being paid back moves from the merchant to the lender. Now, all of a sudden, the lender is the one that takes on all that risk of borrowing and all that risk on the debit card side and everything, whether they will actually have money in the account to pay. So there is a significant risk here to the lender involved. And I want to stress something, too. This is an every-bank issue. I mean, every community bank in America that issues a debit card, which is nearly every one of them, uses interchange fees to help support its ability to offer product and services to its local communities. If you go in and snuff out the ability to have any kind of return on this investment and to take those risks, then you are telling them that they cannot be competitive with the largest institutions in America. We think that is a bad idea."
"Senator Bennet","Doctor, did you have something?"
"Mr. Ausubel","Mr. Clayton is overstretching a bit in saying that an interchange fee is just like, what did you say, the cost of labor and things like that. The difference is that there is market power to be exercised in setting the interchange fee. The interchange fee is set by Visa, by MasterCard, and a few other select organizations. There is market power there which is not present in most of the other costs facing small businesses."
"Mr. Clayton","There is, by the way, a consolidated lawsuit in New York to determine whether, in fact, market power has been illegally exercised, and we can determine that. We would argue that it is not the case and that there is competitive pricing in that market, but that court will determine it."
"Mr. Levitin","Also, the European Union's antitrust enforcement body has actually said that interchange fees are anticompetitive. That is being appealed, but we at least have a broad several countries that have recognized the problems with interchange fees. I think it is important to note, though, that what Professor Zywicki said is incorrect about interchange fees. There is a serious difference between interchange fees on credit cards and the cost of cash or checks or payment devices like that. If a merchant wants to charge more for cash, that is the merchant's prerogative. The merchant cannot surcharge for a credit card. If the merchant does so, the merchant is violating its agreement with its acquirer bank. Also, 45 percent of the cost of interchange fees, that is just going to fund rewards programs. Merchants don't get any benefit from that. That is going for frequent flyer miles for rewards junkies. So at least 45 percent of the cost of interchange has really no benefit for merchants. There is no evidence of ticket lift, contrary to what Mr. Clayton says. If you want to find out how happy merchants are when they have adopted credit cards, talk to McDonald's. McDonald's adopted credit cards thinking that they would get some ticket lift. Everything I hear is they have not been real pleased with it, but they have had to sink in a lot of money and that they are kind of trapped in that now."
"Mr. Zywicki","May I have an opportunity to respond briefly?"
"Senator Bennet","I am out of time, so it is up to the Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Respond briefly, if you will."
"Mr. Zywicki","The issue is whether or not consumers are paying the full cost of the transaction that they are using, and the fact is, when a consumer writes a check, that is subsidized by the Federal Reserve. When a consumer uses cash, that currency is printed by the government. So every payment device has a subsidy somewhere in it. Sometimes it is the Federal Reserve. Sometimes it is printing currency. And so the issue I was referring to is whether or not consumers are subsidized in their transaction device, not the particular issue that Professor Levitin responded to."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. One of my concerns about this, and we have had long discussions in the past about interchange fees, it is about a $48 billion revenue stream this year alone, the estimates are, just from interchange fees coming in. What it does, it creates the climate of sort of the liar loan problem we saw with the residential mortgage market because there, the idea is then the sheer volume of the number of cards out there create a revenue stream, just by the volume of the cards out. And the incentive then to determine whether or not the borrower actually is creditworthy reduces tremendously under this system. That is one of the concerns I have about it and one of the reasons we ought to have--again, I am not trying to deny someone the access to a credit card, but at least having some responsibility and some understanding of that, that when you have a revenue stream of $48 billion coming in, on the average, it is 2 percent, I think is the average interchange fee, more or less, coming in. That is a remarkable revenue stream and the disincentive to have some verification of the ability of the consumer to meet those obligations, and that contributes, I think, to that environment, which is important."
"Senator Tester?",""
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I think it is in order to congratulate you for having a daughter, a 3-year- old daughter that has effectively used a credit card very, very well. "
"Senator Tester","You know, there have been some comparisons here between using credit cards and buying sweaters, and I think it is OK to make those kind of comparisons, but very seldom when I go home back to Montana do I see three or four sweaters laying on the kitchen table for my kids. This is about--and my concern isn't about adults who know better. I am talking about folks who have been in the business world a bit or the workforce a bit. My concern is about credit card companies that put out an offer that is just too good to be true, and then once the fish is hooked, then the fees go up, people starting getting jerked around, and it is just totally not right. It is simply not right. There has been talk of several bills here today. I have got another one. I think just about every one of these can be incorporated, not to squash the credit card companies, but quite frankly, when I go home, and they don't know the earning history of any of my kids, and they have got a decent earning history now--and I hope they don't get credit cards because I said that--but the truth is that when they were in college, they didn't have much earnings history. When they were in high school, they certainly didn't have much of an earnings history. Then you go home and there are these credit cards laying there. So the question is this. It is for Mr. Clayton, because several times today during the testimony, you talked about these are significantly risky loans that are out there. If these really are significantly risky loans out there, why is there no requirement for any sort of earnings history whatsoever when you give a person a card, particularly a young person, but it could apply to anybody, and say, here it is. There is a line of credit for X-number of dollars. Go out and have fun."
"Mr. Clayton","Well, first of all, card companies do look at income and employment history and otherwise to make----"
"Senator Tester","Well, just real quick, if they are looking at income and earnings history, I can guarantee you they don't look very doggone deep, because when kids in school, when a 3- year-old daughter gets a credit card application, what kind of earnings history are they looking at?"
"Mr. Clayton","I don't think that 3-year-old daughter actually got a card, nor could they be obligated to pay under that card, so--look, marketing, people get letters because they are on some other lists. It doesn't mean they are going to get a credit card. And so to be real clear, I doubt--Senator, please feel free to correct me--I mean, it is a solicitation and so it is nothing more than an advertisement to apply. Credit card companies look carefully at trying to cultivate relationships with 18-year-olds, 20-year-olds, 22-year-olds, 24-year-olds, because they recognize they are in for the long haul. They take that responsibility seriously, and in fact, they take special care. They make sure that their minimum limits are actually--their credit limits are low, and they start off typically with a $500 credit limit and it doesn't grow that quickly. And they work with care to make sure they-- and monitor the card account to make sure they don't get into trouble. One of the things that gets lost in this debate is that, in fact, students perform well in their use of credit cards. There are lots of different studies and different numbers. The numbers that we see are that they perform as well as or if not better than the general population, and they have average balances that are much lower than the general population. So as a practical matter, the vast majority of students are using their cards responsibly and well. Do people get into trouble? Absolutely. Should we be sensitive to that and figure out better ways to address that? I think we would be willing to work with you and figure out how to best do that."
"Senator Tester","And I appreciate that because I think it does need to be done. The fact is, and I will go back to Senator Brown's comments because he brought it up with the Web site from Ohio State. If, in fact, this is true, then why do we see consumer debt going up for kids, going through the roof? And quite frankly, if we are paying tuition with credit cards, we are heading way, way, way down the wrong road there."
"Mr. Clayton","And that clearly is an underlying problem that has nothing to do really with the credit card but the underlying cost of----"
"Senator Tester","You had a point you wanted to make, Mr. Levitin?"
"Mr. Levitin","Yes. As the Chairman noted, all credit card loans are stated income loans. They are all liar loans. When I get a credit card solicitation, I fill in what my income is, there is no way to check on that. The credit card issuers might look at a credit report, but that doesn't say what my income is. That only says whether I have been paying past bills. So if they are looking to be repaid from a future income stream, there is no way to tell."
"Senator Tester","Right."
"Mr. Levitin","And I think it is also--I just want to try and link up two pieces of this, because I think often interchange and the consumer side are seen as separate issues. These are very intimately linked. This is a complete cycle. So interchange funds rewards programs. Rewards programs and teaser rates, those are the honey that lure in the consumer flies into this venus fly trap of sticky interest rates, of hidden fees, and so forth. So if you are concerned about an unsafe and unsound underwriting model, it is not enough just to go out to try and focus on solicitations. You have to look at the entire business model with this."
"Senator Tester","I appreciate that. I want to talk a little bit, and I know that the House Financial Services Committee yesterday had an extensively reported hearing on what is going on with the TARP money. I just want to ask, and I think if there is anybody else that this question applies to, answer, and I don't mean to direct them all to you, Mr. Clayton, but have any of your members raised rates on credit cards that received TARP funds?"
"Mr. Clayton","Let me step back for a second and look at the Fed's recent G-19 report on interest rates, and they basically have shown that interest rates, while they have ticked up a bit, are still approximately 12 percent and are like 136 basis points below what they were a year ago today. And so interest rates are, in fact, on average, relatively low. Are card companies adjusting their interest rates because of the perceived and real risk in the marketplace? Yes."
"Senator Tester","So what you are saying is they did increase the interest rates if they received TARP funds. That was----"
"Mr. Clayton","I don't think that there is more than one relationship. I don't think that has anything to do with the TARP funds. I think they are focusing on the risk in the--I mean, one of the things that gets lost is the complete flexibility and unsecured nature of this product. I mean, I know you look at this as a negative, but also remember there is a positive to this. The flexibility it provides to consumers at two o'clock in the morning when the car breaks down and the tow truck has to take you home, or to pay for some kind of medical service or some kind of treatment for a child if you don't have the money but they need to pay for that is all provided in this little card. And lenders take risks in doing that because people may not pay them back. We talk about liar loans. We are talking about promise loans. These are promise loans made to hundreds of millions of people every day."
"Senator Tester","OK. Go ahead, Travis."
"Mr. Plunkett","Senator, no one is denying credit cards are convenient and useful for consumers. The question is are their practices fair. I mean, the first thing to say to Mr. Clayton is why are interest rates ticking up when the Federal funds rate has dropped through the floor? The next thing to say is that many national banks, as you point out, have received TARP financing, and then Secretary Paulson set up and Secretary Geithner says he will expand this new program called the Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility to support credit card lending. It is not just a question of interest rates. Are the terms fair that will be supported through this program?"
"Mr. Clayton","Let me jump in for a second in terms of answering that first question. Interest rates are not just determined by how much it costs, the Fed prices its loans. Interest rates are determined by lots of other things, including delinquencies in the marketplace, which have gone up, as well as the cost of securitization, where spreads have increased significantly. What that means is investors are demanding more return in order to underwrite or fund card loans."
"Senator Tester","Real quickly, Doctor."
"Mr. Ausubel","Credit cards are extremely useful, but that is not an excuse for completely opaque pricing. I mean, the whole issue--lots of other products, price competition works better because, first of all, it is easier to figure out the true price that the consumer is paying, and second, the price is predictable. Most other consumer products do not have any-time, any-reason clauses."
"Senator Tester","Thank you. Just very quickly, Mr. Chairman. Thank you very much for holding the hearing. Thank you very much for putting your bill in. I will just tell you that you try to teach the next generation the right thing to do. My parents said, you aren't going to have a credit card, and in the days when I got my first credit card, I paid a fee and the interest rates were pretty clear cut. That has all changed now, I think. I know it has changed. But I can tell you that I have so many examples of young people under the age of 35 that get a credit card. They use it, they go on a vacation, their payment comes in late, and the fees and the interest rates take up all the money that was going to the principal. I have got to tell you, that is flat not right. My time has long since run out, but I will just tell you, it is not fair, it is not right, and it is not the way the program should work. People are getting into people's pockets by making it darn easy to sign up with these things, and then if they make one mistake, they put the boots to them. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much."
"Senator Merkley?",""
"Senator Merkley","Thank you very much, Mr. Chair. Professor Zywicki, I think from your comments I could describe you as an advocate for the--there is a competitive market here between cards. But it has been pointed out by Professor Ausubel that that credit market would be stronger if consumers had the ability to have more transparency to understand the rates better, the terms better, if they weren't so complicated, they didn't have so many hidden ways of charging you later, will you pretty much agree with that, or would you contest that?"
"Mr. Zywicki","Thank you for that. First, Senator Tester is leaving. I will just note that with respect to the cost of credit card operations, the cost of funds are about 30 to 40 percent of total costs. Charge-offs are about 30 to 40 percent, and operating costs are about 20 to 30 percent. So the reason we don't is exactly as Mr. Clayton was saying. The reason is when charge-offs go up and risk goes up, the amount that goes obviously to charge-offs goes up and so that dampens any interest-rate effect. So I just thought that would be some facts to put on the record. And I appreciate your question, Senator, because I think it is the most important question here and one that is worth focusing on. This is about complexity, right? These are very complex products. They do have a lot of price points that can confuse consumers. But the reason they are complex is precisely because consumers use these in so many different ways. They use an auto loan to buy a car. They use a mortgage to buy a house. They use a credit card to do a cash advance, to make a purchase, to revolve debt, to travel to Europe, to do all the different sorts of things that they do with it. So there are a lot of price points, but it is precisely because of the myriad different ways in which consumers use these products. We do need a better way of dealing with this. The market is already ahead of us. There is a new Web site called Cardhub.com. I have nothing to do with Cardhub.com. What Cardhub.com is is a Web site you can go to and you can basically get tailormade disclosures. You could say, I am interested in a card that has no annual fee, low transaction fees for travel to Europe, and gas benefits when I use my card, and they have about 1,000 credit cards in their system and you can basically create a tailormade disclosure for exactly the fees that you are looking for. What I get concerned about this is that we take a one-size- fits-all proposal and put it on top of a market where consumers are using cards for all myriad sorts of things. So regulation, I hope, can encourage and be a mechanism for encouraging further innovation, development in these cards, and allowing consumers to get what they want. If I could just add one last fact----"
"Senator Merkley","One quick point. Go ahead."
"Mr. Zywicki","Sure. One last fact is there has been some talk about fees, interchange fees. Just to kind of get the facts on the record, according to the GAO report, about 70 percent of credit card revenues come from interest. About 20 percent come from interchange fees. And about 10 percent come from fees. The fee amount of 10 percent has basically been constant over time. What we have seen is it used to be 10 percent were annual fees, and now they have gone down. Annual fees have basically disappeared. Late fees and that sort of thing have gone up to 10 percent. So the total amount that are fees has remained about 10 percent. Just the nature of the fees has changed."
"Senator Merkley","OK. Well, let me get another perspective on this. I will tell you that I use checks in just as many complicated ways as I use a credit card, so I am not particularly persuaded by your argument on that, but let us get another perspective from Professor Ausubel. And could you also address the fee rate, as well, point?"
"Mr. Ausubel","Right. First of all, on fees, it is well documented that the level of fees has gone up at a very rapid pace over the past 10 years. I mean, you can see it very clearly if you just look at any particular fee, like if you look at the level of the late payment fee that was present in the past and you look at the $39 now."
"Mr. Zywicki","How about the annual fee?"
"Mr. Levitin","May I jump in, Senator? "
"Senator Merkley","Let Professor Ausubel finish and then we will let you jump in."
"Mr. Ausubel","I am talking about fees in aggregate. What was the next thing?"
"Senator Merkley","Well, the first was the complexity of purchases----"
"Mr. Ausubel","Oh, the complexity. So here is a way to think about the business model in the credit card market. What happens is there is a certain number of terms of the credit card account that people pay the most attention to. So, for example, at a certain point, people might have been paying attention to annual fees. Competition steps in and annual fees get competed down. But simultaneously, the banks add new fees which are not on consumers' radar screens which generate real revenues and which take a while for consumers to catch up to. So if you ask, why has the number of fees multiplied, it is to have new revenue sources that are not on consumer radar screens. Can I give you one quick example that is unambiguous? Most issuers have 3 percent fees if you purchase anything in foreign currency. Note that there is absolutely no cost associated with this because the currency conversion fees are already built into the whole operation."
"Senator Merkley","Thank you. I am out of time. Can we allow another person to respond?"
"Chairman Dodd","Please go ahead."
"Senator Merkley","Mr. Levitin?"
"Mr. Levitin","Yes. I think it is really important to note that while some credit card fees do relate to particular usage patterns, the credit card billing practices that are really problematic have no relationship to the way anyone uses a card. Double-cycle billing? How does--I just can't see how that relates to the different ways consumers use cards. Any time, any reason term changes, the same thing. It is not based on usage patterns. These are just hidden fees--these are billing points that function as hidden fees and don't relate to the way consumers actually use cards. They just relate to an ability to snooker consumers in with low teaser rates and then whack them over the head with back-end fees that they aren't expecting."
"Mr. Sturdevant","Senator----"
"Senator Merkley","My time has expired."
"Mr. Sturdevant","I had one point----"
"Chairman Dodd","Go ahead."
"Mr. Sturdevant","There is no more complexity in how consumers use cards today than there was in 1964 when Bank of America introduced them except that we have the Internet now. People make purchases in the same way, in the same variety of ways, and as Senator Tester, I believe, pointed out, in 1964-- and the Chairman did, as well--you had a membership fee, maybe, and you had an interest rate. And that is how the product was marketed until the late 1970s when interest rates hit an historic high of 21 percent and the credit card industry said, we can't make any money. We can't make money anymore from the interest rate to the customer and the interchange fee. So all of a sudden, we had the introduction of the over-limit fee and the late payment fee. And then as time went on, we had more and more fees, the access fee, the quick look fee, the returned check fee, the administrative fee, the extra card fee, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. As interest rates came down--interest rates were very slow to come down in credit cards and none of the fees went away. The only thing that happened is that the amount of the dollars increased sharply. So in 1996, the credit card industry earned $1.7 billion in penalty fee revenue. In 2004, it earned $14.8 billion. If you combine penalty fees, cash advance fees, and annual fees, those three items alone, that reached nearly $25 billion in 2004, and they were sitting in the Dirksen Building and Senator Dirksen was famous for his remark that a million here and a million there, we are talking about real money. In today's climate, a million is nothing and even a billion seems to be nothing. But where I come from, $25 billion is a significant revenue stream. As we have heard today, credit card companies have engaged in conduct to create late payments, to prevent timely payments, to receive the payment and not post the payment, anything it can do to trigger that. With respect to over-limit transactions, the credit card companies through its systems totally control usage. They want over-limit transactions so long as the customer continues to make a payment, and they use the $39 fee when the customer calls to complain to enable the company to raise the credit limit so that there is more debt out there so that the minimum payment is higher on that dollar value. But nothing principally has changed in the marketplace since 1964 except the escalation of the types of fees and the amount of dollars imposed on those fees."
"Mr. Clayton","Senator, I know I am belaboring the point here. I would say that GAO in a 2006 study basically said that total aggregate fees, comparing 1990 to 2004, remained relatively stable, meaning they didn't change. There was a transfer from annual fees to these other types of kind of transaction fees, all of which were basically transferring a fee that a consumer had no control over, an annual fee, versus one--late fees and other things, over-limit fees--that they have some control over."
"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate the point. I mean, an annual fee, that is in terms of the pricing points, that when you pay an annual fee, you know what it is. The question then of when these additional fees kick in, how they kick in, has been the source of the contention. In too many cases, they appear to be for reasons that should be unrelated to the performance of the consumer when it comes to the credit card, and we have talked about them before, the universal default issue, the double- cycle billing. Now, some of these have been changed, I agree with the things, but clearly these fees were not ones that a consumer can price necessarily when they increase them in ways that seem not terribly relevant to the behavior by the consumer. I don't think anybody is suggesting that when a consumer behaves poorly, if you will, in this matter that there are obviously going to be charges associated when that occurs. The question is, it is not so much performing poorly but rather what appears to be, I say to you, that designs to rather get around the fact, because the annual fee wasn't producing the kind of revenues. The competition reduced it, so what other ways can we do this, to find that? And obviously, look, marketing--I know this is probably true no longer, but there was a while not long ago when the parlance of the industry, if you were someone that paid off whatever the obligations were on a monthly basis, you were called a deadbeat, because frankly, you weren't very good financially. Someone who pays that thing off every month, you are not making much money off of them. The ideal consumer is someone who is paying the minimums here each month because that person is going to pay a lot more for that service or product over an extended period of time than the person who pays it off immediately. And it seems to me that by marketing to a lot of people, in a sense, who are in that situation, obviously raises certain concerns. Again, I have got credit cards. I understand the value of them, the importance of them for people, and I want the industry to know this is not a hostile situation we are talking about. We are talking about trying to make it work right for people in a sense at a time of great difficulty, when people are feeling a tremendous pinch. And obviously we have got securitization of this industry, which is another incentive in a way. If you are able to securitize that debt and sell it off someplace, then the incentives for you to want to manage it better are reduced, much as it was in the residential mortgage market. When you can securitize that product and sell it, your interest in having underwriting standards and so forth and to demand greater accountability begin to diminish significantly, and this has been a significant problem. In fact, it is one of the problems the banks have, because they are looking down the road and they are seeing a lot of this debt coming at them, not only in commercial real estate, but also in student loans and in credit card obligations. So obviously one of the reasons they are not lending a lot, I suspect, is because they recognize they have got these obligations coming. Why are they coming? Because they market a lot of products to people who couldn't afford them, in a sense. And had they done a little more work and determined whether or not that person out there was actually going to be able to meet those obligations instead of basically giving them out to anybody and everyone, then we wouldn't be facing this situation, much as we are facing in the residential mortgage market. There are distinctions, obviously, between a mortgage and a credit card obligation, but nonetheless, a little more adherence to those principles would reduce the very problems we are looking at in real estate as well as in commercial transactions such as credit cards. So it is sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy, in a way, we are dealing with in this issue. There is less accountability, marketing to more people who can less likely afford the obligations. Obviously, a lot to be made off of it because obviously someone who has to pay every month something on that over a long period of time increases tremendously the amount they will pay for that. That is why I disagree with you, Mr. Zywicki. I know you don't--I don't disagree with your point, the point I think you were making. I think there is some legitimacy to this. If you load up a load of consumer warnings, there is a point at which no one reads any of it. It is like on prescription drugs or something, or over-the-counter stuff. You begin to read so much that you just--you can't remember any of it. But I do think the idea of saying to people, let me show you that if you purchase a product and make just the minimum monthly payment on this, how much more you are likely to pay for a product, I think that warning to a consumer has value. If you know that, I think you are going to have second thoughts that that item doesn't cost $50, but it is rather going to cost you $150 by the time you are through with it. It has a value. And I don't disagree that if you load it up with a lot of stuff, no one reads any of it, but I think it is an important point. I raised the issue on the securitization and I wonder if you--I will raise the question if any of you want to respond to it. The securitization of credit card loans permitted companies to engage in at least lending practices that are less vigilant. Mr. Clayton, what about that?"
"Mr. Clayton","Securitization was engaged in to lower the cost of borrowing so that we could lower the cost of credit."
"Chairman Dodd","But doesn't it also basically--in other words, the incentive for the issuer to make sure that the borrower is going to be more creditworthy diminishes when you know you are going to be able to sell that debt off. Isn't that also true?"
"Mr. Clayton","There is a significant difference between credit card securitizations and mortgage securitizations. Mortgage securitizations involve, as I understand it, a great deal of pooled loans from a lot of different issuers and underwriters. Credit card loans, they come from one company and that company's reputation and cost of future issuances is dictated by the performance of that underlying securitization."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes."
"Mr. Clayton","So as a practical matter, it is--they hold the risk, and if these trusts unwind, that comes back on the balance sheet. So there are real risks and checks and balances, which is what I think you are referring to, in this area. If the marketplace believes that this doesn't work, the cost of borrowing for that company goes up significantly. So there are real prices to be paid."
"Chairman Dodd","Anyone else? Yes, Mr. Levitin?"
"Mr. Levitin","There is another significant difference between credit card and mortgage securitization. Mortgage securitization, a typical securitization deal, the originator sells off the loans and has no further interest in them. That is not, as Mr. Clayton points out, that is not what happens with credit cards. The card issuer retains essentially the residual interest. Every month, if after--if the cards generate enough income to pay off all the mortgage-backed security bonds, anything left over goes to the card issuer. That is called the excess spread. What this means is that the card issuer holds all the upside, but it has sold off most of the downside to investors. This gives card issuers an incentive to apply more late fees and over-limit fees because that will result in some people defaulting on the debt entirely, but others, it will result in them paying more. This increases volatility. For credit card securitization, the more volatile the accounts are, that all accrues to the benefit of the issuer, and the downside of the volatility goes to the investors."
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, Mr. Ausubel?"
"Mr. Ausubel","I would generally agree with what has been said. I mean, that securitization in the credit card market is fundamentally different than the mortgage market because the credit card issuer remains the residual claimant in the whole business operation. The place where you can find some similarity is that when consumers get distressed, there are some parallels between it giving bad dynamics in one market than the other. I mean, so you have been hearing on the mortgage market you have this problem that the whole system may be better off because--the whole system may be better off if there were some forgiveness, like you modify the terms. When we securitize it, you have one group of people who own the mortgage, another set of people who service the mortgage. The people who service the mortgage may not want to relax the terms because it is not in their benefit. You have the same thing in the credit card market with universal default and that sort of thing, that if a consumer gets into trouble, all the banks, the entire system may be better off if there were some forgiveness, but instead what each bank does is they try to load up what is owed to them and they try to collect as rapidly as possible from the consumer before the consumer goes bankrupt. So you have the same sort of divergence of interests which leads to a sub-optimal level of forgiveness."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, listen, this has been very worthwhile, and Mr. Clayton, I appreciate very much your being here. You know the industry obviously very well and I speak with some frequency to obviously my own bankers in Connecticut and others who have strong views on the issue, as well. My interest is doing something balanced and responsible as we move forward. I am concerned about the lateness of this July effective date in terms of what happens between now and then, and regulations and rules, while they are important and they are not insignificant, statutory changes have a way of bringing more permanency to a process than obviously the vagaries of rulemaking, which can be undone pretty quickly. And so there is a reason, I think, if we can come to some common understandings about some of these points here, that we will be all better off in some ways. But I think all of us up here--I believe all of us up here--have no interest in destroying the credit card industry. We realize the value of it and the importance of it, and I think it is a very important point to take away from a hearing like this, how best we do that. And going back to the point that I hope we learned, because we certainly got away from it, and I am sounding like a broken record on this point, but for too long, I think there was the assumption that consumer protection laws were more than just an annoyance. They were antithetical to the notion of economic growth and prosperity. And we have learned painfully over the last several years how dangerous that mentality is, that, in fact, had consumer protection been very much on the minds of people, on regulators and others, we wouldn't be in the mess we are in today. This was not a natural disaster. This is one that was avoidable. And so it is very important, if we learn anything out of all of this as we try to get back on our feet again, is that that notion of consumer protection ought not to be seen--there are unintended consequences. Bob Corker makes a legitimate point. You want to be careful how you proceed in all of this. But the notion once again that we could ever start thinking about regulation, reform, and creating new architectures for the 21st century, very much a part of that has to be that that end user, that consumer user of products, be they credit cards, mortgages, car loans, student loans, they have got to be paramount in our minds. And when they are, then we have strong economies that grow well, create wealth, create prosperity. When we avoid it and subjugate it or reduce it in its importance, then I think we get ourselves into the kind of mess we have seen recently. So I am very grateful to all of you for your testimony today. We will leave the record open. I am sure there are members who may have some additional questions. You may have some additional information and material you think it would be worthwhile for us to consider in our discussions here as we go forward and we will certainly leave the record open for that. With that, the hearing stands adjourned. I thank you.   "

"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY FROM ADAM J. LEVITIN","  Q.1. Access to Credit: A potential outcome of the new rules could be that consumers with less than a 620 FICO score could be denied access to a credit card. Such an exclusion could affect 45.5 million individuals or over 20 percent of the U.S. population. Without access to traditional credit, where do you believe that individuals would turn to finance their consumer needs?  A.2. I am unsure to which ``rules'' the question refers; I assume it refers to the recent unfair and deceptive acts and practices regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve, Office of Thrift Supervision, and National Credit Union Administration under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act. If so, I strongly but respectfully dispute the premise of the question; the scenario that is presented is exceedingly alarmist. The question wrongly implies that all individuals with FICO scores of 620 or lower currently have access to ``traditional'' credit cards. They assuredly do not. First, nearly 10 percent of the United States adult population is ``unbanked,'' and that means almost by definition that they do not have credit cards; card penetration into the unbanked market is de minimis. Thus, at least half of the impact implied by the scenario is not possible. For the remaining 10 percent or so who have FICOs under 620, many do not currently have access to ``traditional'' credit. Instead, they have access to predatory new credit products like ``fee harvester'' or ``secured'' credit cards. Even if these non-traditional products were included in the term ``traditional,'' I think it is also dubious that all or even most of them would cease to be able to get ``traditional'' credit; nothing in the proposed regulations limits issuers' ability to protect against credit risk through either lower credit limits or higher interest rates or other fees. To the extent that these individuals are not able to get credit cards or choose not to accept them because of onerously high interest rates, the answer to where they would turn for financing needs depends on the particular circumstances of the individual, but I believe that many consumers would first cut down or eliminate non-essential expenses, which would reduce their financing needs. Demand for credit is not entirely inelastic. For these consumers' remaining financing needs, many would turn to family and friends for assistance. See Angela Littwin, Testing the Substitution Hypothesis: Would Credit Card Regulations Force Low-Income Borrowers into Less Desirable Lending Alternatives? 2009 Ill. L. Rev. 403, 434-35 (2009) (noting that borrowing from family and friends is the most frequent form of borrowing for low-income women). It is also important to note that empirical evidence suggests that ``credit cards are actually among low-income consumers' least- preferred sources of credit, meaning that there is no ``worse'' alternative to which they would turn if credit card access were reduced.'' Id. at 454. Beyond family and friends, there are also other legitimate, high-cost sources of credit besides credit cards--pawn shops, rent-to-own, and overdraft protection, e.g. There, of course, is a possibility that some low-income consumers will turn to illegitimate sources of credit, such as loan sharks, but this possibility could be tempered by community-based small loan programs. Indeed, given that the Federal Government is currently subsidizing credit card lending through the Term Asset-Backed Securities Lending Facility (TALF), it seems quite reasonable to support other forms of consumer credit lending. Indeed, in Japan, where there is a 20 percent usury cap, credit rationing and product substitution are significantly tempered by a government-supported small loan system. Nor is it clear that the terms on which ``loan sharks'' lend are actually worse than some subprime credit card products. As Woody Guthrie sang in the Ballad of Pretty Boy Floyd:  Now as through this world I ramble I see lots of funny men Some will rob you with a Six gun And some with a fountain pen. But as through your life you travel As through your life you roam You won't never see an outlaw Drive a family from their home.  Woody Guthrie, American Folksong 27 (1961).  Finally, given the terms on which individuals with FICO scores of under 620 are able to obtain ``traditional'' credit, I think it is quite debatable whether ``traditional'' credit is in any way beneficial to them; fee-harvester cards and other subprime credit card products are as likely to harm consumers with poor credit ratings as they are to help them; these cards can improve consumers' credit scores over time, if the consumer is able to make all the payments in full and on time, but by definition a consumer with a FICO of under 620 is someone who is unlikely to be able to do that.  Q.2. Risk-Based Pricing: Banks need to make judgments about the credit-worthiness of consumers and then price the risk accordingly. Credit cards differ from closed-end consumer transactions, such as mortgages or car loans, because the relationship is ongoing. I am concerned by the Federal Reserve's new rules on risk-based repricing for a couple of reasons. First, without the ability to price for risks, banks will be forced to treat everyone with equally stringent terms, even though many of these individuals perform quite differently over time. Second, without a mechanism to reprice according to risk as a consumer's risk profile changes, many lenders will simply refuse to extend credit to a large portion of the population. Do you believe that consumers will have access to less credit and fewer choices because of the Fed's new rule? If so, is this a desirable outcome?  A.2. Again, I respectfully disagree with the premise of the question. The new uniform Unfair and Deceptive Act and Practices regulations adopted by the Federal Reserve Board, the Office of Thrift Supervision and National Credit Union Administration under section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act (``Reg AA'') do not prohibit risk-based pricing. Reg AA only prohibits retroactive repricing of existing balances. Card issuers remain free to increase interest rates prospectively with proper notice or to protect themselves immediately by closing off credit lines. That said, I would expect that Reg AA would likely reduce credit availability to some degree, although perhaps not to all consumers. This is not necessarily a bad outcome. Credit is a double-edged sword. It can be a great boon that fuels economic growth, but that is only when credit does not exceed a borrower's ability to repay. Credit can also be a millstone around the neck of a borrower when it exceeds the ability to repay. Overleverage is just as bad for consumers as it is for financial institutions. To the extent that Reg AA reduces credit availability, it might be a good thing by bringing credit availability more in line with consumers' ability to repay.  Q.3. Consumer Disclosure: You state that the sheer number of price mechanisms make it difficult for consumers to accurately and easily gauge the cost of credit. You cite things such as annual fees, merchant fees, over-the-limit fees, and cash advance fees. You seem to suggest that credit cards should become much more plain vanilla because people simply can't understand the different uses and costs for those uses. Don't these different pricing mechanisms also provide more choices for consumers as they make purchasing decisions?  A.3. That depends on the particular pricing mechanism. Many of them provide dubious choices or value for consumers. Consider over-limit fees, late fees, cash advance interest rates, and residual interest and double cycle billing.  (1). LOverlimit fees. A consumer has no right to go overlimit and cannot assume that an over-limit transaction will be allowed. Moreover, overlimit can be the result of the application of fees, rather than of purchases. Therefore, overlimit is not exactly a ``choice.''  (2). LA late fee is no different than interest, just applied in a lump sum. I am doubtful that most consumers would prefer an up-front lump sum late fee rather than a higher interest rate. For the large number of ``sloppy payers'' who pay their bills a few days late, a higher interest rate is much better than a large flat late fee, but because consumers systematically underestimate the likelihood that they will pay late, they are less concerned about the late fee than the interest rate.  (3). LMost cards charge a higher interest rate for ``cash advances.'' A cash advance, however, is not necessarily the payment of cash to the consumer. Instead, cash advances include the use of so-called ``convenience checks'' that card issuers send to consumers with their billing statements. (Incidentally, convenience checks present a considerable identity theft problem because they lack cards' security features and the cardholder has no way of knowing if they have been stolen. They expose issuers to significant fraud losses and should be prohibited as an unsafe and unsound banking practice.) Convenience checks permit cardholders to use their card to pay merchants that do not accept cards, like landlords, utilities, and insurers. This allows consumers to pay these bills even when they do not have funds in their bank account. But convenience checks carry the cash advance interest rate plus a fee (often a flat 3 percent with a minimum amount). These terms are usually disclosed on the convenience checks only partially and by reference to the cardholder agreement. It is doubtful that most consumers retain their cardholder agreement, so whether consumers understand the cost of using convenience checks is a dubious proposition.  (4). LSimilarly, billing tricks and traps like residual interest or double cycle billing are hardly a ``choice'' for consumers; these are not product differentiations that are tailored to consumer preferences, as few consumers know about them, let alone understand them.  Restricting card pricing could limit innovation in the card market, but it is important to recognize that not all innovation is good. There has been very little innovation in the card industry over the last twenty years, either in terms of technology or in terms of product. Cards still operate on the same old magnetic stripe technology they had in the 1970s. The card product still performs the same basic service. To the extent there has been innovation, it has been in the business model, and it has frequently not been good for consumers. Even things like the 0 percent teaser rate are hardly unambiguous goods. While 0 percent teasers are great for consumers who can pay off the balance, they also encourage consumers to load up on credit card debt, and if there is a shock to the consumer's income, such as a death, an illness, a divorce, or unemployment, the consumer is much more exposed than otherwise. I recognize that it is important to protect the ability of the card industry to innovate in the future, and that is why I believe the best solution is to set a default rule that simplifies credit card pricing, but to allow a regulatory agency, such as the Federal consumer financial product safety commission proposed by Senators Durbin, Kennedy, and Schumer and Representative Delahunt (S. 566/H.R. 1705, the Financial Product Safety Commission Act of 2009) to have the power to card issuers to introduce new products and product features provided that they meet regulatory consumer safety standards.  Q.4. Bankruptcy Filings: As the recession worsens, many American families will likely rely on credit cards to bridge the gap for many of their consumer finance needs. Mr. Levitin and Mr. Zywicki, you seem to have contrasting points of view on whether credit cards actually force more consumers into bankruptcy, or whether credit cards help consumers avoid bankruptcy. Could both of you briefly explain whether the newly enacted credit card rules will help consumers avoid bankruptcy or push more consumers into bankruptcy?  A.4. The newly enacted Federal Reserve credit card regulations will not have any impact on bankruptcy filings presently, as they do not go into effect until summer of 2010. When they do go into effect, their impact on consumer bankruptcy filings will likely be mixed. Credit card debt has a stronger correlation with bankruptcy filings than other types of debt. But this is not necessarily a function of credit card billing practices. Card debt reflects the macroeconomic problems of the American family--rising costs of health care, education, and housing but stagnant wages and depleted savings. The card billing tricks and traps targeted by the Fed's rules amplify this distress, but the Fed's rules will not solve the fundamental problems of the American family. To the extent that they limit the amplifying effect that card billing tricks and traps have on card debt levels, it will help some consumers avoid bankruptcy. If the rules result in contraction of credit availability, it might push consumers into bankruptcy, but that would have to be netted out against the number that are helped by a reduction in the amplification effect, and I am skeptical that there would be much contraction. I agree with Professor Zywicki that credit cards can help some consumers avoid bankruptcy. If a consumer has a temporary setback in income, credit cards can provide the consumer with enough funds to hang on until their financial situation reverses. But credit cards can also exacerbate financial difficulties, and even if the consumer's fortunes pick up, it might be impossible to service the card debt. Moreover, there are many consumers whose financial situations are not going to pick up, and for these consumers, card debt just adds to their distress.  Q.5. Safety and Soundness and Consumer Protection: I believe firmly that safety and soundness and consumer protection go hand-in-hand. One needs only to look at the disaster in our mortgage markets, for clear evidence of what happens when regulators and lenders divorce these two concepts. A prudent loan is one where the financial institution fully believes that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay. Do you agree that prudential regulation and consumer protection should both be rigorously pursued together by regulators?  A.5. Yes, but not by the same regulators. There is an essential conflict between safety-and-soundness and consumer protection. A financial institution can only be safe and sound if it is profitable. And abusive and predatory lending practices can often be extremely profitable, especially in the short term, and can compensate for the lender's other less profitable activities. The experience of the past decade shows that when Federal regulators like the Office of Comptroller of the Currency, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the Federal Reserve are charged with both safety-and-soundness and consumer protection, they inevitably (and perhaps rightly) favor safety- and-soundness at the expense of consumer protection. These functions cannot coexist in the same agency, and consumer protection responsibilities for financial products should be shifted to a single independent Federal agency (which would not claim preemptive authority over state consumer protection actions) to protect consumer protection.  Q.6. Subsidization of High-Risk Customers: I have been receiving letters and calls from constituents of mine who have seen the interest rates on their credit cards rise sharply in recent weeks. Many of these people have not missed payments. Mr. Clayton, in your testimony you note that credit card lenders have increased interest rates across the board and lowered credit lines for many consumers, including low-risk customers who have never missed a payment. Why are banks raising interest rates and limiting credit apparently so arbitrarily?  A.6. Banks are raising interest rates on consumers and limiting credit to cover for their own inability to appropriately price for risk in mortgage, securities, and derivatives markets has resulted in their solvency being threatened. Therefore, banks are trying to limit their credit card exposures and are trying to increase revenue from credit card accounts by raising rates. If banks are unable to competently price for risk for mortgages, where there is often robust underwriting, what confidence should we have in their ability to price for risk for credit cards where every loan is a stated income ``liar'' loan? The current financial debacle should cause us to seriously question banks' claims of risk- based pricing for credit cards. The original pricing failed to properly account for risk and the new arbitrary repricing certainly fails to account for risk on an individualized level. The only risk being reflected in the new pricing is the bank's default risk, not the consumer's.  Does this result in low-risk customers subsidizing people who are high-risk due to a track record of high-risk behavior?  Yes, it probably does because it is being done so arbitrarily.  Q.7. Effects on Low-income Consumers: I want to put forward a scenario for the witnesses. Suppose a credit card customer has a low income and a low credit limit, but a strong credit history. They use their credit card for unexpected expenses and pay it off as soon as possible, never incurring late fees. With the new regulations approved by the Federal Reserve, banks will be restricted in their use of risk-based pricing. This means our cardholder could see his or her interest rates and fees increased to pay for the actions of other card holders, many of whom have higher incomes. Do any of the witnesses have concerns that moving away from risk-based pricing could result in the subsidization of credit to wealthy yet riskier borrowers, by poorer but lower-risk borrowers?  A.7. No. The issue is a red-herring. As an initial matter, it is important to emphasize that the Federal Reserve's new regulations do not prohibit risk-based pricing. They only prohibit retroactive repricing of existing balances. In other words, they say that card issuers only get one bit at the risk pricing apple, just like any normal contract counterparty. Card issuers remain free to price however they want prospectively or to reduce or cutoff credit lines if they are concerned about risk. Second, it is important to underscore that to the extent that card issuers engage in risk-based pricing, it is only a small component of the cost of credit. I discuss this at length in my written testimony, but I will note that Professor Zywicki has himself written that 87 percent of the cost of credit cards has nothing to do with consumer risk; it is entirely a function of the cost of operations and the cost of funds. Todd J. Zywicki, The Economics of Credit Cards, 3 Chap. L. Rev. 79, 121 (2000). The remaining 13 percent represents both a risk premium and opportunity pricing. In many cases the opportunity-pricing component predominates. Therefore, there to the extent that credit card issuers do risk based pricing, it only has a marginal impact on the total cost of cards. As Professor Ausubel demonstrated in his written and oral testimony, a significant component of some credit card fees, like late fees, are opportunity costs. Likewise, in my written testimony, the section comparing my own credit cards, three of which are from the same issuer, but which have different rates that do not correspond with credit limits, indicates that there is significant opportunity pricing in the card market. Regulations that make cards fairer and more transparent would be unlikely to have much impact on consumer pricing. Third, it is not clear why cross subsidization should be a particular concern. It is a common fact of life. Consider flat- fee parking lots. Those consumers who park for 5 minutes subsidize those who park for hours. Similarly, at by-the-pound salad bars, consumers who eat only carrots subsidize those who eat only truffles. When cross-subsidization is regressive, it elicits additional concerns, but there are far more serious regressive price structures, not the least of which is the Internal Revenue Code. That said, I believe the cross-subsidization in the scenario to be unlikely because the risk that matters to card issuers is nonpayment risk, not late payment risk, and income and wealth generally correlate with low nonpayment risk. In sum, then, I think the cross-subsidization scenario presented is unlikely, and to the extent it occurs, the cross- subsidization will only be de minimis because of the limited extent of risk-based pricing. The problem presented by the scenario is a red herring concern and not a reason to shy away from regulating credit cards.   "
"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY FROM KENNETH J. CLAYTON","  Q.1. Access to Credit: A potential outcome of the new rules could be that consumers with less than a 620 FICO score could be denied access to a credit card. Such an exclusion could affect 45.5 million individuals or over 20 percent of the U.S. population. Without access to traditional credit, where do you believe that individuals would turn to finance their consumer needs?  A.1. It is likely that consumers perceived to have higher levels of risk--including those that are new to credit--will bear the brunt of credit reductions resulting from the rule. Thus, as noted in your question, the inability to price risk effectively may well mean less access to credit for very deserving individuals just because card issuers are unsure of the credit risk involved and will not be able to price for that risk as it becomes more apparent. As the credit needs of these individuals are unlikely to disappear--and, in fact, may actually increase due to exigent economic circumstances, e.g., unemployment--these consumers will likely be forced to turn to non-federally regulated lenders including payday lenders and loan sharks.  Q.2. Risk-Based Pricing: Banks need to make judgments about the credit-worthiness of consumers and then price the risk accordingly. Credit cards differ from closed-end consumer transactions, such as mortgages or car loans, because the relationship is ongoing. I am concerned by the Federal Reserve's new rules on risk-based repricing for a couple of reasons. First, without the ability to price for risks, banks will be forced to treat everyone with equally stringent terms, even though many of these individuals perform quite differently over time. Second, without a mechanism to reprice according to risk as a consumer's risk profile changes, many lenders will simply refuse to extend credit to a large portion of the population. Do you believe that consumers will have access to less credit and fewer choices because of the Fed's new rule? If so, is this a desirable outcome?  A.2. The new rule will affect every aspect of the credit card business, from how cards are funded, to how they are priced, to how they are marketed, and to how credit is allocated among customers of differing credit histories and risk. Because the rules are so strong, card lenders may have to increase interest rates in general, lower credit lines, assess more annual fees, and reduce credit options for some customers. The full impact of these changes will likely not be fully known for several years as business practices are changed and as the credit availability works its way through the economy. The new rule may also lead to higher interest rates or fees (such as annual fees) for all cardholders in order to compensate for the inability to price risk effectively. Thus, the least risky borrowers must now bear the cost for higher risk borrowers because the higher-risk borrowers will no longer bear the full cost of the exposure they pose to lenders. It may also be the case that payment allocation requirements will lead to the elimination of low-rate balance transfers that consumers and small businesses previously used to lower overall debt costs. Simply put, the sum total of all these rules will likely lead to reduced access to credit and higher prices to all consumers, in addition to many fewer choices on card products. We do not believe this is a desirable outcome for both consumers and the broader economy.  Q.3. Safety and Soundness and Consumer Protection: I believe firmly that safety and soundness and consumer protection go hand-in-hand. One needs only to look at the disaster in our mortgage markets, for clear evidence of what happens when regulators and lenders divorce these two concepts. A prudent loan is one where the financial institution fully believes that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay. Do you agree that prudential regulation and consumer protection should both be rigorously pursued together by regulators?  A.3. A system linking bank regulation and consumer protection forces more balanced supervision without the turf battles and inefficiency inherent in bifurcated jurisdiction. The two are highly integrated, and that one aspect cannot and should not be divorced from the other. This ensures that, for example, safe and sound lending would not be compromised by fee and rate restrictions envisioned by a consumer regulator only concerned with driving consumer costs down unencumbered by a need to consider the impact such restrictions may have on adequate return.  Q.4. Subsidization of High-Risk Customers: I have been receiving letters and calls from constituents of mine who have seen the interest rates on their credit cards rise sharply in recent weeks. Many of these people have not missed payments. Mr. Clayton, in your testimony you note that credit card lenders have increased interest rates across the board and lowered credit lines for many consumers, including low-risk customers who have never missed a payment. Why are banks raising interest rates and limiting credit apparently so arbitrarily? Does this result in low-risk customers subsidizing people who are high-risk due to a track record of high-risk behavior?  A.4. The rising interest rates and limitations on credit are due primarily to three factors. First, in the present challenging economic time, lenders are being more careful. Delinquencies on credit card accounts have significantly increased as a result of rising unemployment and uncertainty in the economy. This substantial increase in repayment risk affects the ability of lenders to make new loans, and requires companies to carefully evaluate and minimize their risk across the board so that they may stay in business and continue to make new loans. Second, funding costs have increased dramatically in the secondary market, which funds nearly half (or approximately $450 billion) of all credit card loans made by commercial banks. Investors are extremely sensitive to changes in the terms and conditions of the underlying asset, as has been evident in the current market, where investors have shunned nearly all forms of asset-backed securities over fears in the underlying economy. This drives up the cost of funding new credit, and leads to higher costs to consumers. Third, all businesses are concerned for the future, as borrowers' ability to repay may become severely compromised. This is particularly true with respect to credit card loans, which are open-end lines of credit, unsecured and greatly subject to changing risk profiles of borrowers. Banks need to ensure they will be paid for the risks they have taken in credit card loans; otherwise they will not be able to continue to make loans. As a result, many institutions must raise rates and reduce risk exposure in order to continue to lend. This results in all borrowers having to bear the cost of higher risk generally, a trend that will be exacerbated by the new regulations that limit the ability of lenders to price particular individuals for the risk they pose.  Q.5. Effects on Low-income Consumers: I want to put forward a scenario for the witnesses. Suppose a credit card customer has a low income and a low credit limit, but a strong credit history. They use their credit card for unexpected expenses and pay it off as soon as possible, never incurring late fees. With the new regulations approved by the Federal Reserve, banks will be restricted in their use of risk-based pricing. This means our cardholder could see his or her interest rates and fees increased to pay for the actions of other card holders, many of whom have higher incomes. Do any of the witnesses have concerns that moving away from risk-based pricing could result in the subsidization of credit to wealthy yet riskier borrowers, by poorer but lower-risk borrowers?  A.5. Reducing the ability of lenders to manage risk forces them to apply more general models to all account holders. The consequence of applying general models is that all account holders pay somewhat equally. Lower-risk borrowers at all income levels bear the brunt of this burden.  Q.6. Role of Securitization: It is my understanding that during the height of the credit boom nearly half of all credit card debt outstanding was held in securitization trusts. Over the last 18 months much of the securitization market has been severely constrained. The Federal Reserve wants to revive the securitization markets through the Term Asset Lending Facility (TALF), but it is not yet operational. How important is a rebound in the securitization market to the availability of consumer credit? In other words, how much greater will the contraction be in the credit card space without securitization?  A.6. The rebound in the securitization market is a critical component to the availability of credit in our economy. Credit cards are funded from two primary sources: deposits and secondary market funding, each accounting for about half-- approximately $0.5 trillion dollars--of the total funding of card loans to consumers. Funding in the secondary market relies on investors' willingness to hold securities that are backed by credit card receivables. Any change in the terms of issuance can greatly impact the receptivity of investors to holding these securities. If investors perceive that there is greater risk, they are less likely to hold these securities, or may require significantly higher interest rates or other enhancements to compensate them for the risk. This means that less funding will be available, and if available, more costly. This translates into less credit available at higher cost to customers. It is hard to speculate as to the extent of greater contraction caused by a non-functioning securitization market, as lenders will have to turn to a limited number of alternative--and higher priced--funding mechanisms. However, we do believe the additional contraction would be very significant, and is reflected in the Administration's concern over this important aspect of the marketplace.   "

The new regulations seem to limit the ability of lenders to use tools to distinguish between the borrowers characteristics. Do you believe that borrowers' rates and fees should be determined based on their own actions and not on those of others?

"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY FROM TODD ZYWICKI","  Q.1. Access to Credit: A potential outcome of the new rules could be that consumers with less than a 620 FICO score could be denied access to a credit card. Such an exclusion could affect 45.5 million individuals or over 20 percent of the U.S. population. Without access to traditional credit, where do you believe that individuals would turn to finance their consumer needs?  A.1. This is the most worrisome aspect of well-intentioned consumer credit regulations that will have unintended consequences of driving borrowers, especially credit-impaired borrowers, to other less-attractive forms of credit. Those who ore unable to get a credit card will likely be forced to turn to alternatives such as payday lending. Those unable to get credit from a payday lender will likely be forced to turn to pawn shops. And those who are unable to gain access to pawn shop credit may find themselves unable to get legal credit at all. Consumers often have emergencies or necessities for which they need credit. For instance, a young person needs credit to start a life away from home--clothes for a job, furniture for an apartment, etc. Consumers may have emergencies such as car repairs, for which they will have to find credit somewhere. If good credit is not available consumers will turn toward less- attractive terms of credit instead.  Q.2. Benefits of Credit Card Use: Professor Zywicki, in previous testimony you suggested growth in credit cards as a source of consumer credit has replaced installment lending, pawnshops, and payday lending. I am concerned that the newly finalized rules may result in a lack of available consumer credit. I believe that there were clearly some egregious practices that the Federal Reserve and others should appropriately eliminate, but many who have criticized the credit card industry for facilitating excessive consumer debt, fail to point out the benefits of open access to consumer credit. Does the consumer benefit from access to open ended consumer credit over other less regulated forms of credit such as pawn shops, payday lenders, and installment lending?  A.2. Consumers absolutely benefit from access to open-ended consumer credit. The dramatic growth in credit card use in recent decades testifies to this fact. Installment lending, such as retail store credit is limited because it requires consumers to ``buy'' goods and credit as a bundle. Personal finance company loans are typically both more expensive for the buyer to apply for, offer higher interest rates and other costs, and impose a rigid repayment schedule. A borrower also might be unable to get a personal finance company loan at the moment that he needs it. Payday lending and pawnshops are obviously inferior to credit cards and these other options. Credit cards offer consumers many benefits that these other products do not. Credit cards have flexible use and repayment terms. Borrowers can pay as much as they want and can switch easily among alternative card issuers. They are also generally acceptable, thereby allowing the unhooking of the credit transaction from the goods transaction. This allows consumers to shop more vigorously in both markets. General-acceptance credit cards also permit small businesses to compete on an equal footing with large businesses and department stores by relieving those small businesses of the risk and cost of maintaining their own in-house credit' operations. According to one survey conduct by the Federal Reserve, 73 percent of consumers report that the option to revolve balances on their credit cards makes it ``easier'' to manage their finances versus only 10 percent who said this made it ``more difficult.'' Durkin, Credit Cards: Use and Consumer Attitudes at 623.  Q.3. Risk-Based Pricing: Banks need to make judgments about the credit-worthiness of consumers and then price the risk accordingly. Credit cards differ from closed-end consumer transactions, such as mortgages or car loans, because the relationship is ongoing.

First, without the ability to price for risks, banks will be forced to treat everyone with equally stringent terms, even though many of these individuals perform quite differently over time. Second, without a mechanism to reprice according to risk as a consumer's risk profile changes, many lenders will simply refuse to extend credit to a large portion of the population. Do you believe that consumers will have access to less credit and fewer choices because of the Fed's new rule? If so, is this a desirable outcome?  A.3. This is likely to be the case, for exactly the reasons stated. If lenders are permitted only to reduce interest rates but not raise them, they will have to charge a higher interest rate to all borrowers to compensate for this risk. Moreover, this would give borrowers an opportunity to reduce their interest rates by switching to another card but lenders would be unable to raise interest rates in response to a change in the borrowers risk profile. Credit cards are structured as revolving debt for a reason: unlike other loans, it amounts to a new loan every month. Thus, every month the borrower has the option to switch to another, lower-interest card.  Q.4. Bankruptcy Filings: As the recession worsens, many American families will likely rely on credit cards to bridge the gap for many of their consumer finance needs. Mr. Levitin and Mr. Zywicki, you seem to have contrasting points of view on whether credit cards actually force more consumers into bankruptcy, or whether credit cards help consumers avoid bankruptcy. Could both of you briefly explain whether the newly enacted credit card rules will help consumers avoid bankruptcy or push more consumers into bankruptcy?  A.4. By making credit cards less-available and less- flexible, new stringent regulations will likely push more consumers into bankruptcy. Consumers in need of credit will seek that credit somewhere. Reducing access to good credit, like credit cards, will force these borrowers into the hands of much higher-cost credit, such as payday lenders. Moreover, credit cards are especially valuable because they provide a line of credit that the borrower can access when he needs it, such as when he loses his job and has medical bills. By contrast, if the borrower is required to apply for a bank loan after a job loss, he is likely to be rejected, which will accelerate his downward spiral. Moreover, credit cards are valuable in that they can be used to purchase almost any good or service. Again, the flexibility of credit cards is valuable to consumers.  Q.5. Safety and Soundness and Consumer Protection: I believe firmly that safety and soundness and consumer protection go hand-in-hand. One needs only to look at the disaster in our mortgage markets, for clear evidence of what happens when regulators and lenders divorce these two concepts. A prudent loan is one where the financial institution fully believes that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay. Do you agree that prudential regulation and consumer protection should both be rigorously pursued together by regulators?  A.5. Yes. But not all safety and soundness issues related to consumers are also consumer protection issues. For instance, there were obviously a number of ordinary homeowners who essentially decided to act like investors with respect to their homes by taking out nothing-down, no-interest mortgages and then walking away when those homes fell into negative equity. If the consumers failed to understand the terms of those mortgages, then that is a consumer protection issue. If, however, the consumer consciously made this choice to speculate and the lender made the loan anyway, then while this would trigger a safety and soundness concern it is difficult to see how this would amount to a consumer protection issue.  Q.6. Subsidization of High-Risk Customers: I have been receiving letters and calls from constituents of mine who have seen the interest rates on their credit cards rise sharply in recent weeks. Many of these people have not missed payments. Mr. Clayton, in your testimony you note that credit card lenders have increased interest rates across the board and lowered credit lines for many consumers, including low-risk customers who have never missed a payment. Why are banks raising interest rates and limiting credit apparently so arbitrarily? Does this result in low-risk customers subsidizing people who are high-risk due to a track record of high-risk behavior?  A.6. Did not respond by publication deadline.  Q.7. Effects on Low-income Consumers: I want to put forward a scenario for the witnesses. Suppose a credit card customer has a low income and a low credit limit, but a strong credit history. They use their credit card for unexpected expenses and pay it off as soon as possible, never incurring late fees. With the new regulations approved by the Federal Reserve, banks will be restricted in their use of risk-based pricing. This means our cardholder could see his or her interest rates and fees increased to pay for the actions of other card holders, many of whom have higher incomes. Do any of the witnesses have concerns that moving away from risk-based pricing could result in the subsidization of credit to wealthy yet riskier borrowers, by poorer but lower-risk borrowers?  A.7. Interference with risk-based pricing makes it more difficult for lenders to tailor prices to the details of the behavior of particular consumers. As a result, lenders have to price card terms on less fine-grained assessments of risk. This leads to pricing risk across broader categories of borrowers, and in turn, increases the cross-subsidization among consumers. I can see no good policy reason why this should be encouraged.  Q.8. Restriction on Access to Credit: One suggestion being made in order to encourage students not to become overly dependent on debt is to restrict access to credit to individuals under the age of 21. Mr. Zywicki, could you explain for the Committee the potential benefits and detriments of this policy?  A.8. Benefit: A potential benefit, in theory, is that some younger consumers may avoid getting into debt trouble. I am not aware of any rigorous empirical evidence of how common this is. Detriments: There are several detriments:  (1) LStudents who do not have access to credit cards may be tempted to take out more in the way of student loans. Because repayment on student loans is deferred until after graduation, this could cause students to take on more debt than they would if they had to pay some of their balance every month.  (2) LEmpirical studies find that one major reason that causes students to drop out of college is a lack of access to credit. Many students eventually tire of ``living like a student,'' i.e., living in dorms and eating dorm food and Ramen noodles. They want an opportunity to have some sort of normal life, to go out to dinner every once in a while. Many students use credit responsibly and maturely and can have a happier student life experience if they have access to a credit card.  (3) LMany students need access to credit. Although under the age of 21, many students essentially live on their own in off-campus apartments and the like. They need credit cards to pay for food, transportation, and the like. Thus, the rule sweeps far too broadly.  (4) LSince the early 1990s, the fastest-rising debt on household balance sheets has been student loan debt. Students routinely graduate with tens of thousands of dollars in student loan debt. By contrast, very few students have more than a few thousand dollars in credit card debt. If Congress wants to seriously help indebted students, it should investigate the extraordinary level of student loan debt being accumulated. While credit cards can be a problem in some cases, the scope of the problem is dwarfed by the deluge of student loan debt.   "
"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY FROM LAWRENCE M. AUSUBEL","  Q.1. Access to Credit: A potential outcome of the new rules could be that consumers with less than a 620 FICO score could be denied access to a credit card. Such an exclusion could affect 45.5 million individuals or over 20 percent of the U.S. population. Without access to traditional credit, where do you believe that individuals would turn to finance their consumer needs?  A.1. There is no reason to expect that the new rules will result in the wholesale denial of access to credit cards for any group of consumers that currently has access to credit cards. As such, individuals who currently have access to credit cards are likely to continue to rely primarily on credit cards for their consumer finance needs.  Q.2. Risk-Based Pricing: Banks need to make judgments about the credit-worthiness of consumers and then price the risk accordingly. Credit cards differ from closed-end consumer transactions, such as mortgages or car loans, because the relationship is ongoing. I am concerned by the Federal Reserve's new rules on risk-based repricing for a couple of reasons. First, without the ability to price for risks, banks will be forced to treat everyone with equally stringent terms, even though many of these individuals perform quite differently over time. Second, without a mechanism to reprice according to risk as a consumer's risk profile changes, many lenders will simply refuse to extend credit to a large portion of the population. Do you believe that consumers will have access to less credit and fewer choices because of the Fed's new rule? If so, is this a desirable outcome?  A.2. There is no reason to expect that consumers will have significantly less access to credit or fewer choices because of the Fed's new rule. The principal effect of the new rule will be to limit penalty pricing of credit card consumers, not to limit access to credit or consumer choices.  Q.3. Safety and Soundness and Consumer Protection: I believe firmly that safety and soundness and consumer protection go hand-in-hand. One needs only to look at the disaster in our mortgage markets, for clear evidence of what happens when regulators and lenders divorce these two concepts. A prudent loan is one where the financial institution fully believes that the consumer has a reasonable ability to repay. Do you agree that prudential regulation and consumer protection should both be rigorously pursued together by regulators?  A.3. It should be observed that consumer protection, as furthered by the Dodd bill, will help to contribute to the prudency of loans. Consumers will better understand whether they will be able to repay loans, and they will be more likely to avoid loans that they understand they do not have the reasonable ability to repay. Lenders will be unable to rely on penalty interest rates following delinquency, so they will be more likely to avoid making loans that are destined to go delinquent. It is difficult to state an opinion on prudential regulation more generally, without being provided some specificity about the form of prudential regulation being proposed.  Q.4. Subsidization of High-Risk Customers: I have been receiving letters and calls from constituents of mine who have seen the interest rates on their credit cards rise sharply in recent weeks. Many of these people have not missed payments. Mr. Clayton, in your testimony you note that credit card lenders have increased interest rates across the board and lowered credit lines for many consumers, including low-risk customers who have never missed a payment. Why are banks raising interest rates and limiting credit apparently so arbitrarily? Does this result in low-risk customers subsidizing people who are high-risk due to a track record of high-risk behavior?  A.4. If it is the case that banks are raising interest rates and limiting credit arbitrarily, this is probably due primarily to the financial crisis and the economic downturn. Under normal circumstances, credit card lending is highly profitable and there is little reason for banks to reduce credit lines. Banks do raise interest rates, but usually not across the board, as this would result in the loss of some profitable customers. There is no reason to expect that the new rules will lead to cross-subsidization of any particular group of customers.  Q.5. Effects on Low-income Consumers: I want to put forward a scenario for the witnesses. Suppose a credit card customer has a low income and a low credit limit, but a strong credit history. They use their credit card for unexpected expenses and pay it off as soon as possible, never incurring late fees. With the new regulations approved by the Federal Reserve, banks will be restricted in their use of risk-based pricing. This means our cardholder could see his or her interest rates and fees increased to pay for the actions of other card holders, many of whom have higher incomes. Do any of the witnesses have concerns that moving away from risk-based pricing could result in the subsidization of credit to wealthy yet riskier borrowers, by poorer but lower-risk borrowers?  A.5. No. There is no reason to expect that the new rules will lead to cross-subsidization of any particular group of customers. The principal effect of the new rules will be to limit increases in credit card interest rates following late payments. As documented in my written testimony, the typical increases in interest rates bear no reasonable relation to default risk. The penalties imposed on consumers are typically at least double or triple the enhanced credit losses attributable to these consumers. The terminology of ``risk- based pricing'' for the regulated practices is a misnomer; it is more accurately viewed as ``penalty pricing.'' Under the new rules, banks will still be able to charge higher interest rates (upfront) to riskier customers. That is, true risk-based pricing will still be possible within the rules.   "
"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY FROM TRAVIS PLUNKETT","  Q.1.  Without access to traditional credit, where do you believe that individuals would turn to finance their consumer needs?  A.1.  As I mentioned in my testimony before the Committee, it is important to note that the lack of regulation can also lead to detrimental market conditions that ultimately limit access to credit for those with less-than-perfect credit histories. Credit card issuers have recently reduced the amount of credit they offer to both existing and new cardholders, for reasons that have virtually nothing to do with pending regulation of the market. Issuers losses have been increasing sharply, in part because of unsustainable lending practices. (Please see my written testimony for more information.) Had Congress stepped in earlier to require issuers to exercise more responsible lending, they might not be cutting back on available credit as sharply right now. Regarding access to affordable credit for individuals with an impaired or limited credit history, CFA has urged mainstream financial institutions to offer responsible small loan products to their depositors. We applaud FDIC Chairman Sheila Bair's leadership in proposing guidelines for responsible small loans and her call for military banks to develop products that meet the test of the Military Lending Act predatory lending protections. Banks and credit unions should extend their line of credit overdraft protection to more account holders. The FDIC has a pilot project with 31 participating banks making loans under the FDIC guidelines for responsible small-dollar lending. Offering affordable credit products is not the only strategy needed to help households more effectively deal with a financial shortfall. Borrower surveys reveal that many households are not using high-cost credit because of a single financial emergency, but instead have expenses that regularly exceed their income. For these households who may not be able to financially handle additional debt burdens at any interest rate, non-credit strategies may be more appropriate. These may include budget and financial counseling; getting help from friends, family, or an employer; negotiating with a creditor; setting up different bill payment dates that better align with the person's pay cycle; and putting off a purchase for a few days. Toward this end, it is very important that banks and credit unions encourage make emergency savings easy and attractive for their low- and moderate-income customers. Emergency savings are essential to keep low-income consumers out of the clutches of high-cost lenders. CFA's analysis based on Federal Reserve Board and other survey data found that families earning $25,000 per year with no emergency savings were eight times as likely to use payday loans as families in the same income bracket who had more than $500 in emergency savings. We urge banks and credit unions to make emergency savings easy and attractive for their customers.  Q.2.  Do you agree that prudential regulation and consumer protection should both be rigorously pursued together by regulators?  A.2.  Absolutely. Credit card issuers must do a better job of ensuring that borrowers truly have the ability to repay the loans they are offered. As I mention in my testimony, card issuers and card holders would not be in as much financial trouble right now if issuers had done a better job of assessing ability to repay. This is why CFA has supported legislation that would require issuers to more carefully assess the repayment capacity of young borrowers and potential cardholders of all ages.  Q.3.  Do any of the witnesses have concerns that moving away from risk-based pricing could result in the subsidization of credit to wealthy yet riskier borrowers, by poorer but lower-risk borrowers?  A.3.  Under the Federal Reserve rules, card issuers will certainly have to be more careful about who they extend credit to and how much credit they offer. Given the current levels of indebtedness of many card holders--and the financial problems this indebtedness has caused these borrowers and card issuers-- it is hard to argue that this is a bad thing. However, the Federal Reserve rules still preserve the ability of card issuers to price for risk in many circumstances, if they wish. They can set the initial rate a cardholder is offered based on perceived financial risk, reprice on a cardholder's existing balance if the borrower is late in paying a bill by more than 30 days, and change the borrower's prospective interest rate for virtually any reason, including a minor drop in the borrower's credit score or a problem the borrower has in paying off another debt. In addition, issuers can manage credit risk in more responsible ways by reducing borrowers' credit lines and limiting new offers of credit.  Q.4.  Do you believe that borrowers' rates and fees should be determined based on their own actions and not on those of others?  A.4.  It is certainly reasonable to base offers of credit on legitimate assessments of borrowers' credit worthiness. As I mention in my testimony, however, many of the pricing methods that card issuers have used to arbitrarily increase borrowers' interest rates and fees do not appear to be based on true credit risk, but rather on the judgment of issuers that they can get away with charging what the market will bear.  Q.5.  Do you think that credit card offerings from the past, which had high APR's and annual fees for all customers were more consumer friendly than recent offerings that use other tools to determine fees and interest rates.  A.5.  As I mention in my response above, the Federal Reserve rules leave plenty of room for card issuers to price according to borrower's risk, so I do not think it is likely that we will see a return to the uniform, undifferentiated pricing policies of the past.  </pre></body></html>"
