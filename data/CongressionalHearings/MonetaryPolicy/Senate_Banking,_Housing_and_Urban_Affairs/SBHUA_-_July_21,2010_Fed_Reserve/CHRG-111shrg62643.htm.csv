"Speaker","Speech"
"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. We are here today to hear from the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on the semiannual monetary policy report to the Congress, and, Mr. Chairman, we welcome you to our Committee once again. We thank you for your service to our country, and at least on my part, let me thank you and congratulate you for the tremendous work you and the staff of the Federal Reserve have been doing through these very difficult days in our country, and we are very fortunate to have you, in my view, as the Chair. I want to make some brief opening comments, and then I will turn to Senator Shelby for any opening comments he may have, and I will leave it up to the members themselves--we do not have a full complement here, but there are several who would like to be heard briefly before we turn to you for your thoughts, and then the questions we will have for you this afternoon. Let me express my gratitude to the Chairman and the other Members of the Committee. Normally, we would have had this Committee hearing in the morning, and because of the bill- signing ceremony this morning, we delayed it until this afternoon. So I appreciate you being able to accommodate us. We are pleased to welcome you again, Mr. Chairman, to the Committee. Today he will deliver his semiannual monetary policy report, as I have said, to the Congress. The timing of this testimony could not be better, in our view. Key questions about both financial regulation and our current economic policy will be answered in the coming months. The Federal Reserve will play a key role in answering both of those series of questions. Today the President, as many know, signed into law the Wall Street reform bill. This bill, in my view, is a comprehensive response to our financial crisis that devastated our economy. The bill demands that regulators change the oversight of the financial markets and financial institutions in very fundamental ways. It sets up a Financial Stability Oversight Council which will function as an early warning system, we hope, be responsible for spotting and addressing threats to the overall financial stability of our country and institutions and even in other nations around the world. It creates a new orderly liquidation authority to provide for the wind-down of large financial institutions whose failure threatens overall financial stability. Further, it makes the markets for financial derivatives much more transparent. It requires regulators to establish capital standards and margin requirements for large derivative dealers. That will reduce the risk, we believe, posed by these financial instruments. Further, it limits the ability of banks and their owners to engage in risky trading strategies or to invest in hedge funds or private equity funds. Further, it requires higher prudential standards, including capital and liquidity for large bank holding companies and nonbank financial firms that have the potential to put the financial system at risk. The bill establishes for the first time a Consumer Financial Protection Bureau with a mandate to focus exclusively on protecting consumers from financial abuses and ensuring that consumers get the financial information that they need in a form that they can understand. But while the bill gives regulators substantial new authority, it does not contain the specific regulations that will translate authority into action. Congress is not in the position to write them. It is above the capacity of this institution to do that. Those rules and regulations require expert knowledge, and they must adapt over time to changing circumstances. Congress must rely on regulatory agencies to implement the goals of this reform bill. However, it is the role of Congress to oversee the actions of our regulators, and given the importance of getting financial reform right, it is a role that should be pursued with great vigor, attention, and diligence in the coming months and years. The Federal Reserve is one of the institutions on which Congress will rely most heavily. The additional authority it has been given is remarkable in this bill. The Federal Reserve will be a member of the Oversight Council, and the insights of its supervisors and researchers will play an important part in identifying developing risks to the financial system. It will be the Fed's job to set the heightened prudential standards for the Nation's large banks and nonbank financial companies designated by the Oversight Council. The Fed will help to decide when a failing financial firm needs to be put into the new resolution process, and the Fed will have the responsibility to oversee important financial utilities, including, for example, the clearinghouses that will become increasingly central in derivatives markets. As you are aware, Mr. Chairman, I have been critical of the Fed's past performance and, in fact, advocated striking the Fed's supervisory role. While the Fed managed the financial crisis superbly, in my view, it did less well in the run-up to the crisis. It failed to use the authority in HOEPA to prevent the serious deterioration in mortgage underwriting standards and abusive and fraudulent mortgage lending practices that, in my view, fueled the financial crisis we have been going through. It also failed, in my view, to adequately supervise some of our largest bank holding companies. These holding companies were allowed to accumulate significant exposures to mortgage-related assets. The losses they suffered when the house price bubble burst helped to produce the financial crisis from which we have not yet fully recovered. However, as the financial reform bill worked its way through the legislative process, the Congress in its wisdom decided not only to preserve the Fed's existing supervisory power but to bolster it. Indeed, Mr. Chairman, you sought those additional powers, and as a result, the Fed is central to maintaining our financial stability. I think it is fair to say that the success of the financial reform law depends in large measure on how the Federal Reserve meets its new responsibilities. It is my fervent hope that under your stewardship the Fed will exercise these authorities wisely. Of course, the financial reform law left the Fed's responsibilities for monetary policy unchanged, and this gives the Fed even more crucial work to do. The devastation brought by the financial crisis is still with us, and while output has begun to grow, it is not growing rapidly enough to replace the millions of jobs lost during this crisis. In the first quarter of this year, GDP grew at an unimpressive 2.7 percent. The unemployment rate in June was still at 9.5 percent, and nearly 7 million workers have been unemployed for 27 weeks or more. As you have acknowledged in previous testimony, Mr. Chairman, the effects of long-term unemployment, which destroys job skills and demoralizes those who suffer from it, has the potential to create serious long-term problems in our Nation. And although firms with access to credit markets are able to borrow at relatively low interest rates, the businesses and households that depend upon banks for credit continue to find difficulty in accessing credit. Apart from inventories, investment demand remains anemic, and real fixed investment declined in the first quarter of this year. In this less than robust environment, it is not surprising that price inflation is hardly an issue. Over the past year, the CPI has increased by only 1.1 percent, and core CPI has increased by only 0.9 percent. In short, it looks like our economy is in need of additional help. It is evident that the Fed takes this issue seriously, and I applaud you for that. The Federal funds rate is now near zero, and the banks are now sitting on extraordinary quantities of excessive reserves. But one of the issues I would like to explore with you today is whether the Fed can do more to help expand output and employment in our Nation. Now I would like to turn to my good friend and colleague, the former Chairman of the Committee, Senator Shelby, for any opening comments he may have. "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY"," "
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Welcome to the Committee again, Chairman Bernanke. You have been with us for many years now on many occasions. Mr. Chairman, judging by the minutes of the Fed's June Open Market Committee meeting and statements by Fed officials, uncertainty about the economic outlook has risen recently, and there is a growing divergence of views. Recent data suggests that the already modest recovery may have hit a soft patch. We have also recently experienced another flight to quality and elevated uncertainty given the events surrounding Greece and others. Although some concerns have waned, we should continue, I believe, to monitor the situation in Europe and learn from their fiscal difficulties. Given market uncertainties and the possibility of a double- dip recession, there has been a modest change in the Fed's outlook as reflected in its recent policy discussions about whether inflation or deflation is the predominant current threat. There are questions about what the Fed's contingency plans are in the event of a double-dip recession or persistent deflationary pressures. There are questions about whether the Fed could combat deflationary pressures or whether the U.S. would have any experience like Japan. There are questions about whether the Fed has changed its focus from executing an exit strategy to lowering interest rates on reserves and possibly further ballooning its balance sheet with more asset purchases. This is especially concerning because the purchase of even more long-term assets may channel credit to favored segments of the markets at the expense of others. In the current environment in which the distinction between fiscal and monetary policy is sometimes blurred, Fed transparency about its plans I think is crucial. I believe that it is important for Congress to know what options are on the table and where the Fed may be headed. Chairman Bernanke, as the economic outlook has become a bit more cloudy of late, I look forward to hearing your views here today, and I am sure all of us have a number of questions for you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Shelby. Any of my colleagues want to be heard on this? Anyone here on the Democratic side? Senator Bunning."
"Senator Bunning","Very short."
"Chairman Dodd","Certainly. "
"STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING"," "
"Senator Bunning","It is amazing to me how two people can differ on a financial reserve law than the Chairman and myself. Some of us think that we did not do enough and we did not hit the heart of the problem. We did not touch Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Derivatives, credit default swaps, we just barely skimmed the top. And we did not do anything but put into the law too big to fail. So, Chairman, I am anxious to hear what the outlook for the economy is. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Anyone else wish to be heard? Any opening comments at all?"
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, I do not want to make an opening comment. I know you know that well. But how long is the Chairman going to be with us today, just so we can organize our thinking about questions? And how long will the question period be?"
"Chairman Dodd","Well, a good part of the afternoon, my guess. I do not know. Votes on the floor may disrupt us. I do not know what the Majority and Minority Leaders' plans are for voting. I know there may be four or five votes at some point. And I think under the rules there are about 10 minutes--some five amendments that the minority has on the bill, and each amendment could take 10 minutes of debate, plus the vote itself. So I do not know when that will come. But that could disrupt the flow, I will tell you that much."
"Senator Corker","Do you expect one round or two, do you know?"
"Chairman Dodd","I will stay as long as people want and try and get through as much as we can. Mr. Chairman, welcome. "
"STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM"," "
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you. Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. The economic expansion that began in the middle of last year is proceeding at a moderate pace, supported by stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. Although fiscal policy and inventory restocking will likely be providing less impetus to the recovery than they have in recent quarters, rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth. In particular, real consumer spending appears to have expanded at about a 2\1/2\-percent annual rate in the first half of this year, with purchases of durable goods increasing especially rapidly. However, the housing market remains weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction. An important drag on household spending is the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty about job prospects. After 2 years of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during the first half of this year, a pace insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially. In all likelihood, a significant amount of time will be required to restore the nearly 8\1/2\ million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009. Moreover, nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than 6 months. Long-term unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workers' employment and earnings prospects. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software appears to have increased rapidly in the first half of the year, in part reflecting capital outlays that had been deferred during the downturn and the need of many businesses to replace aging equipment. In contrast, spending on nonresidential structures--weighed down by high vacancy rates and tight credit--has continued to contract, though some indicators suggest that the rate of decline may be slowing. Both U.S. exports and U.S. imports have been expanding, reflecting growth in the global economy and the recovery of world trade. Stronger exports have in turn helped foster growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Inflation has remained low. The price index for personal consumption expenditures appears to have risen at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of the year. Although overall inflation has fluctuated, partly reflecting changes in energy prices, by a number of measures underlying inflation has trended down over the past 2 years. The slack in labor and product markets has damped wage and price pressures, and rapid increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee and I expect continued moderate growth, a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, and subdued inflation over the next several years. In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and reserve bank presidents prepared forecasts of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The forecasts are qualitatively similar to those we released in February and in May, although progress in reducing unemployment is now expected to be somewhat slower than we previously projected, and near-term inflation now looks likely to be a little lower. Most FOMC participants expect real GDP growth of 3 to 3\1/2\ percent in 2010, and roughly 3\1/2\ to 4\1/2\ percent in 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate is expected to decline to between 7 and 7\1/2\ percent by the end of 2012. Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal, and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside. Most participants projected that inflation will average only about 1 percent in 2010 and that it will remain low during 2011 and 2012, with the risks to the inflation outlook roughly balanced. One factor underlying the Committee's somewhat weaker outlook is that financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial crisis--have become less supportive of growth in recent months. Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt spurred a broad-based withdrawal from risk taking in global financial markets in the spring, resulting in lower stock prices and wider risk spreads in the United States. In response to these fiscal pressures, European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance package for Greece and 500 billion euros of funding to backstop the near-term financing needs of euro-area countries. To help ease strains in U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve reestablished temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and several other major central banks. To date, drawing under the swap lines has been limited, but we believe that the existence of these lines has increased confidence in dollar funding markets, helping to maintain credit availability in our own financial system. Like financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also improved significantly since the worst of the crisis. Loss rates on most types of loans seem to be peaking, and in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs. However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans on their books, and bank lending standards remain tight. With credit demand weak and with banks writing down problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to contract. Small businesses, which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit. At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of funds to creditworthy small businesses. Along with the other supervisory agencies, we have issued guidance to banks and examiners emphasizing that lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses. We also have conducted extensive training programs for our bank examiners, with the message that lending to viable small businesses is good for the safety and soundness of our banking system as well as for our economy. We continue to seek feedback from both banks and potential borrowers about credit conditions. For example, over the past 6 months we have convened more than 40 meetings around the country of lenders, small business representatives, bank examiners, Government officials, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas about the challenges faced by small businesses, particularly in obtaining credit. A capstone conference on addressing the credit needs of small businesses was held at the Board of Governors in Washington last week. This testimony includes an addendum that summarizes the findings of this effort and possible next steps. The Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and the recession has included several components. First, in response to the periods of intense illiquidity and dysfunction in financial markets that characterized the crisis, the Federal Reserve undertook a range of measures and set up emergency programs designed to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets in the form of fully secured, mostly short-term loans. Over time, these programs helped to stem the panic and to restore normal functioning in a number of key financial markets, supporting the flow of credit to the economy. As financial markets stabilized, the Federal Reserve shut down most of these programs during the first half of this year and took steps to normalize the terms on which it lends to depository institutions. The only such programs currently open to provide new liquidity are the recently reestablished dollar liquidity swap lines with major central banks that I noted earlier. Importantly, our broad-based programs achieved their intended purposes with no loss to the taxpayers. All of the loans extended through the multiborrower facilities that have come due have been repaid in full, with interest. In addition, the Board does not expect the Federal Reserve to incur a net loss on any of the secured loans provided during the crisis to help prevent the disorderly failure of systemically significant financial institutions. A second major component of the Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and recession has involved both standard and less conventional forms of monetary policy. Over the course of the crisis, the FOMC aggressively reduced its target for the Federal funds rate to a range of 0 to \1/4\ percent, which has been maintained since the end of 2008. And as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions-- including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds rate for an extended period. In addition to the very low Federal funds rate, the FOMC has provided monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, Federal agency debt, and agency mortgage-backed securities, or MBS. A range of evidence suggests that these purchases helped to improve conditions in mortgage markets and other private credit markets and put downward pressure on longer-term private borrowing rates and spreads. Compared with the period just before the financial crisis, the System's portfolio of domestic securities has increased from about $800 billion to $2 trillion and has shifted from consisting of 100 percent Treasury securities to having almost two-thirds of its investments in agency-related securities. In addition, the average maturity of the Treasury portfolio has nearly doubled, from 3\1/2\ years to almost 7 years. The FOMC plans to return the System's portfolio to a more normal size and composition over the longer term, and the Committee has been discussing alternative approaches to accomplishing that objective. One approach is for the committee to adjust its reinvestment policy--that is, its policy for handling repayments of principal on the securities--to gradually normalize the portfolio over time. Currently, repayments of principal from agency debt and MBS are not being reinvested, allowing the holdings of these securities to run off as the repayments are received. By contrast, the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities are being reinvested in new issues of Treasury securities with similar maturities. At some point, the committee may want to shift its reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities to shorter-term issues so as to gradually reduce the average maturity of our Treasury holdings toward pre-crisis levels, while leaving the aggregate value of those holdings unchanged. At this juncture, however, no decision to change reinvestment policy has been made. A second way to normalize the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's securities portfolio would be to sell some holdings of agency debt and MBS. Selling agency securities, rather than simply letting them run off, would shrink the portfolio and return it to a composition of all Treasury securities more quickly. FOMC participants broadly agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used as part of the strategy to normalize the portfolio. Such sales will be implemented in accordance with a framework communicated well in advance and will be conducted at a gradual pace. Because changes in the size and composition of the portfolio could affect financial conditions, however, any decisions regarding the commencement or pace of asset sales will be made in light of the committee's evaluation of the outlook for employment and inflation. As I noted earlier, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds rate for an extended period. At some point, however, the committee will need to begin to remove monetary policy accommodation to prevent the buildup of inflationary pressures. When that time comes, the Federal Reserve will act to increase short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at Federal reserve banks. To tighten the linkage between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term market interest rates, the Federal Reserve may also drain reserves from the banking system. Two tools for draining reserves from the system are being developed and tested and will be ready when needed. First, the Federal Reserve is putting in place the capacity to conduct large reverse repurchase agreements with an expanded set of counterparties. Second, the Federal Reserve has tested a term deposit facility, under which instruments similar to the certificates of deposit could be auctioned to depository institutions. Of course, even as the Federal Reserve continues prudent planning for the ultimate withdrawal of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, we also recognize that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain. We will continue to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic developments, and we remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our Nation's productive potential in a context of price stability. Last week, the Congress passed landmark legislation to reform the financial system and financial regulation, and the President signed the bill into law this morning. That legislation represents significant progress toward reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and strengthening the capacity of financial regulators to respond to risks that may emerge. Importantly, the legislation encourages an approach to supervision designed to foster the stability of the financial system as a whole as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Within the Federal Reserve, we have already taken steps to strengthen our analysis and supervision of the financial system and systemically important financial firms in ways consistent with the new legislation. In particular, making full use of the Federal Reserve's broad expertise in economics, financial markets, payment systems, and bank supervision, we have significantly changed our supervisory framework to improve our consolidated supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, and we are enhancing the tools we use to monitor the financial sector and to identify potential systemic risks. In addition, the briefings prepared for meetings of the FOMC are now providing increased coverage and analysis of potential risks to the financial system, thus supporting the Federal Reserve's ability to make effective monetary policy and to enhance financial stability. Much work remains to be done, both to implement through regulation the extensive provisions of the new legislation and to develop the macroprudential approach called for by the Congress. However, I believe that the legislation, together with stronger regulatory standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed, will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past 3 years. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would be pleased to respond to your questions."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, and what I will do is I will ask the Clerk to--let us try 7 minutes a round. Again, I won't be banging down the gavel too hard, but if people try and keep them in that timeframe, it will be helpful since we have got a pretty good turnout, if we can. Let me begin by raising the issue--Senator Shelby made note of the reference to the recent crisis in Europe. Let me start out there, if I can. As the European Union announced its financial stabilization program in May, you briefed us, in fact, here on the Committee on the Fed's decision to temporarily reopen the dollar swap lines with the ECB and other foreign central banks to support liquidity in the dollar funding markets. Clearly, the Fed identified a need to protect the American economy from events in Europe. With continued downgrades of European sovereigns--I noticed Ireland, just the other day, they downgraded a bit--European bank stress test results expected this week, and again, there has been a lot written about that, how successful they may be, and the uncertainty about future economic growth, as well, what challenges lie ahead, in your view, for the efforts you and your counterparts in Europe have made to stabilize the financial system?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, as I mentioned, concerns about the European situation created some problems in financial markets this spring, which spilled over into our own financial markets, as well. The Europeans have been quite aggressive in addressing these problems. As you know, they, together with the IMF, have provided a financial program for Greece and they have collectively developed a stabilization fund of 500 billion Euros, together with additional funds potentially from the IMF, to be used to ensure that countries under fiscal stress will be able to make their payments and to finance their governments. And indeed, in the last few weeks, we have seen some of the troubled governments being able to go back to the market, which I think is encouraging. The Federal Reserve's liquidity swap lines were a relatively minor part of that effort, but I think they have provided some assurance that dollar funding markets will be sufficiently liquid and have reduced the risks to our own financial system. The other thing that the Europeans are doing is trying to duplicate the success of the American bank stress tests of a little more than a year ago by conducting a set of stress tests whose results are supposed to be released later this week. Of course, it remains to be seen how effective those stress tests are, but it is clear that the Europeans are very focused and very committed to addressing these issues, and my sense is that the financial market concern about European problems has diminished to some extent recently, which is, in turn helpful to our economy. But we will at the Federal Reserve continue to be in close contact with our colleagues in Europe. I am going to Europe for this weekend. And we will continue to monitor developments and their potential impact to the U.S. economy."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I appreciate that, and I think the committee would probably as a general matter like to be kept abreast and informed as to your observations regarding their progress. Obviously, a lot of difficulty. While they share common currencies and so forth, the differences in fiscal policies in the various countries make their ability to resolve these in some sort of united fashion even more difficult, it seems. But I hope your assessment is correct. Let me, if I can, raise an issue that has been--and it is not your job, obviously, to get into policy debates here on specific legislative matters, so I am not going to try and pin you down on that. But we are going through the debate here now. Obviously, we have got slow growth, as you pointed out, high unemployment, low interest rates, low inflation. And again, obviously, we have got deficits that are mounting. And so the debate back and forth is to where is the balance? How do we strike here, an austerity program or do we try and stimulate some economic growth in the country at the same time and how do we do that. You are a student of the Depression era, and there are many who have written about the failure of the New Deal administration after the first couple of years to not sustain a policy of economic growth, in fact, follow an austerity path, again, using that language. And those who have argued that because they did that, they delayed, of course, the second or more--or delayed recovery during that period of time. Give us your take on this as a general matter. And again, I am not asking you to engage in the debate about specific budget requests and the like. But stepping back sort of with a macro approach here, what do you advise us in the legislative branch as to how to approach this debate, because obviously it is tearing us a bit apart up here and we need to strike some balance in all of this. Deficit reduction is clearly a goal we have got to focus on, but also, simultaneously, we have got to try and stimulate economic growth in the country which requires some government activity, as well."
"Mr. Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, as you know, this is very controversial and there has been a lot of debate on both sides. On the one hand, and I will come back to a kind of recommendation, but on the one hand, you have folks who are focusing on the need for government support in the current economic environment. Obviously, in the United States and in many other countries, we have a great deal of excess capacity. Private spending is weak. And so the argument is that additional fiscal support might be helpful to the economy."
"Chairman Dodd","Right."
"Mr. Bernanke","On the other side, you have people who are concerned about the longer-term deficit situation, are worried that financial markets might respond in an adverse way or confidence might respond in an adverse way to signals that any government is not committed to long-term fiscal sustainability. So there is some truth to both of those arguments. I think the right way to combine them is to think about the entire trajectory of fiscal policy. I do believe that at the current moment, that the large deficits, as unattractive as they are, are important for supporting economic activity and they were important also in restoring financial stability, and so I think they were justified in that respect and I would be reluctant to withdraw that support too precipitously in the near term. At the same time, to maintain confidence and keep interest rates low, it is very important that we have a strong and credible plan for reducing deficits over the next few years. So if we think of this instead of either/or and think of it as a combination and think about the trajectory, the best approach, in my view, is to maintain some fiscal support for the economy in the near term, but to combine that with serious attention to addressing what are very significant fiscal issues for the United States in the medium term."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me pick up on that, because again, you and I have chatted over the years and I have been very impressed with some of your writings about the long-term effects of unemployment. We have a tendency to see these matters where we have got a certain level of unemployment. Then things happen and we get people back to work. That is obviously the goal. But talk to us about the long-term effects of unemployment. What worries you about that, in a brief comment, if you would?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, this is part of the reason why I am concerned about the current situation and why I made reference in my remarks to the fact that, currently, about half of the unemployed have been unemployed for 6 months or more. So in terms of long-term unemployment, this is the worst labor market, the worst episode since the Great Depression. Of course, long-term unemployment is very stressful for the unemployed and their families, being without income or reduced income for such a long period of time. But even from the perspective of economic growth and stability, as we have seen in other countries, people who are unemployed for a long period of time often see their skills atrophy or see their skills become irrelevant to the new economy or the way the economy is developing, or they may become demoralized and may become separated from the labor market. Indeed, long-term unemployment sometimes becomes permanent unemployment. So not only for the sake of the unemployed and for the short-term strength of the economy, but also for our long-term viability and international competitiveness, I think we need to be very seriously concerned about the implications of long-term unemployment for skills, for labor force attachment, for long- term earnings and employment opportunities."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I appreciate that, and obviously that was the point I was trying to make here. Your point is that there is enough empirical data on this and other examples that have occurred so that is not mere speculation about what can happen in terms of job skill levels and the ability of people then to recover and get back on their feet, not just individually, but overall the economy of a country is affected by it."
"Mr. Bernanke","There is a good bit of research on this question."
"Chairman Dodd","I thank you for that. Let me turn to Senator Shelby."
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, we all, I think, agree that long-term unemployment problems is a cancer dealing with our economy and people's operations. On the other hand, a spiraling deficit and accumulated debt like we are going through now is also a real problem. And the question is, how do we balance that and how much time do we have, isn't it?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, as I responded to the Chairman, I absolutely agree that this is a concern, that if there is a loss of confidence in the financial markets that the United States is committed to and will achieve long-term fiscal sustainability, then the implications could be bad, not only for our long-term growth prospects, but they could actually hurt the current recovery for higher interest rates or higher inflation expectations. So it is very important to demonstrate as best we can, given the difficulties of committing future Congresses and so on, but to demonstrate as best we can that we are serious about addressing long-term issues. And so I don't think it is either/ or. I think you really need to do both."
"Senator Shelby","But accumulating debt after debt each year is not good for anybody in this country, is it----"
"Mr. Bernanke","I agree."
"Senator Shelby","----short term, right?"
"Mr. Bernanke","If the debt continues to accumulate and becomes unsustainable, as the Congressional Budget Office believes our current policies are, then the only way that can end is through a crisis or some other very bad outcome."
"Senator Shelby","Do you, as Chairman of the Fed, do you believe that our current continuing to have these big deficits adding to our debt is unsustainable?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I do, and I think that view is widely shared."
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, the minutes of the June FOMC, the Federal Open Markets Committee meeting, stated, and I will quote, ``The committee would need to consider whether further policy stimulus might become appropriate if the outlook were to worsen appreciably.'' Aside from taking the Federal funds rate and the interest rate paid on reserves to zero, it is not clear to me what further policy stimulus would mean. If further stimulus were to involve more asset purchases that you alluded to by the Fed, would the Fed buy Treasuries or would they try to channel credit to specific segments of the financial markets, such as housing or perhaps even municipal debt?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I think it is important to preface the answer by saying that monetary policy is currently very stimulative, as I am sure you are aware."
"Senator Shelby","Yes."
"Mr. Bernanke","We have brought interest rates down close to zero. We have had a number of programs to stabilize financial markets. We have language which says that we plan to keep rates low for an extended period. And we have purchased more than a trillion dollars in securities. So certainly no one can accuse the Fed of not having been aggressive in trying to support the recovery. That being said, if the recovery seems to be faltering, then we will at least need to review our options, and we have not fully done that review and we need to think about possibilities. But broadly speaking, there are a number of things that we could consider and look at. One would be further changes or modifications of our language or our framework describing how we intend to change interest rates over time, giving more information about that. That is certainly one approach. We could lower the interest rate we pay on reserves, which is currently one-fourth of 1 percent. The third class of things, though, has to do with changes in our balance sheet, and that would involve either not letting securities run off, as they are currently running off, or even making additional purchases. We have not come to the point where we can tell you precisely what the leading options are. Clearly, each of these options has got drawbacks, potential costs. So we are going to continue to monitor the economy closely and continue to evaluate the alternatives that we have, recognizing that policy is already quite stimulative."
"Senator Shelby","Some people believe that the Fed is running out of options. From what you just said, you believe you still have some options, depending on the circumstances."
"Mr. Bernanke","I think we do still have options, but they are not going to be the conventional options and so we need to look at them carefully and make sure we are comfortable with any step that we take."
"Senator Shelby","I want to get into the area of small business lending. Mr. Chairman, I hear reports of a credit crunch for small businesses and calls by other people to initiate more government programs to jump start lending in this area. I have two questions related to small business credit. First, is there some market failure or regulatory failure inhibiting the flow of small business credit which requires even more government intervention? Second, is there any slow down in small business credit because of weaker demand, because of a deterioration in financial conditions of small businesses and values of the collateral that they hold, or because of regulators somehow inhibiting or preventing good loans from being made? In other words, do we know the definitive reason for the slow down in credit flow to small businesses and what is your take?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, we have done a great deal of work on this and the addendum to my remarks gives you some of the findings of our meetings around the country on this issue. Certainly, a significant part of the reduction in lending to small business is the result either of lower demand, because firms don't want to expand, they don't have the final demand to grow----"
"Senator Shelby","Uncertainty, perhaps?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I am sorry?"
"Senator Shelby","Uncertainty in the economy?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Uncertainty and other factors. In other cases, the firm might like to expand, but its collateral value has declined and it is financially weaker and it is no longer viewed as being creditworthy at the current credit standards. So there are certainly a number of reasons why the demand for credit or the attractiveness of some borrowers has declined in this recession. At the same time, we want to be sure that every creditworthy small business or borrower is able to obtain credit, and while there are many issues to look at as regulators, one that we are particularly concerned about is that bank regulators might somehow be putting the thumb on the scale on the wrong side and being excessively cautious about not letting banks issue what are even marginally risky loans and not taking into account the importance to our economy that creditworthy borrowers receive credit. And so much of our effort has been focused on instructing and training our examiners to take a balanced approach, where they both are taking appropriate caution, but also making sure that creditworthy borrowers can get credit."
"Senator Shelby","My time is running and has run. GSE debt reform--do you believe that the debt of Fannie and Freddie is backed by the full faith and credit of the United States of America?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, not technically or legally, but, of course, the----"
"Senator Shelby","Do you believe----"
"Mr. Bernanke","Legally, I don't know what the legal status is. I don't think it has been given that status by the Congress. But, of course----"
"Senator Shelby","Do you believe the market has given that status?"
"Mr. Bernanke","The market, I think, takes appropriate comfort from the fact that there is a considerable amount of appropriated funds backing up those two companies."
"Senator Shelby","What risk does the Fed face in holding GSE debt?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, for exactly the reason you just raised, that the Treasury is providing backstop support for the mortgages, we are taking essentially no credit risk. There is some interest rate risk, if interest rates were to rise sharply. But on the other side of that, with our very low cost of funding, we have actually been earning a fairly high income from our holdings and have been remitting that to the Treasury."
"Senator Shelby","Last, do you believe that it is important for Congress to act quickly to reform the GSEs and provide certainty and clarity to our Nation's housing policies?"
"Mr. Bernanke","And I have said so before and I agree with that, Senator."
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much."
"Senator Reed",""
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke. As you pointed out, the President signed the financial reform bill this morning and there are many that thought we could not do it, get it passed. But it is a tribute to Senator Dodd's leadership, actually, the collaboration of everyone on this committee, including many of my Republican colleagues. People thought we couldn't do it, and I think there is a sizable population out there that believes that the regulators might undo much of what we have done. So could you give us your sense of how procedurally and substantively you and your fellow regulators will prevent or at least ensure that the regulated community doesn't have an inappropriate influence on the rules and regulations that are going to be developed?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, speaking for myself and the Federal Reserve, we think that the framework in this bill is very constructive. It addresses many of the gaps and problems that we saw in the crisis, and for our part, we intend to write rules that will implement the intent of Congress and that will be sufficiently tough to ensure that the risk of another crisis is very low. A lot of the effectiveness of this bill, of course, depends on the implementation, not just the rule writing, but also the actual supervision and execution of those rules, and we are taking this very seriously. We are restructuring our entire supervisory framework, both intellectually and in management terms, to make sure that we are able to address risks to the broader financial system as this bill envisions and that we are able to support the FDIC in its wind-down function and the CFTC and SEC in their oversight of central counterparties, et cetera. So we are very committed to making this work and we think it gives us the tools that will allow us to do that."
"Senator Reed","Just to follow up, I think you understand that there is a very--the high degree of skepticism. And you go into this, I presume, acknowledging that in the public, so that your efforts have to be transparent and not only for the substance, but also the appearance of the deliberation is not influenced by anyone, is that a fair----"
"Mr. Bernanke","That is absolutely right. I would add that we are also working with our international colleagues on capital liquidity standards, which I think will be an additional strength of the overall reform package."
"Senator Reed","Mr. Chairman, I have been made aware, and others have, too, that there is roughly $2 trillion on the balance sheets of American companies that is not being deployed in new product research, investment, expansion of jobs. Can you give us an indication of why that is happening? And also, it would seem to me that this recovery is going to either be led by very aggressive Federal policy to support employment or private policy, and the private money is there but it is not happening."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the larger corporations, in particular, have had a significant rebound in their profits. They have been able to refinance their debt at quite favorable terms, given the low interest rates in corporate bond markets. And, of course, they have been reluctant to make large capital investments in an environment where they have a lot of excess capacity. And so for all those reasons and also for reasons of caution, those cash balances have built up. My presumption is that as uncertainty declines, as firms become more confident in the recovery, that they will deploy those funds and that will be an important source of growth for our economy."
"Senator Reed","Mr. Chairman, let me talk about another area which could be and in some cases already is a potential drag on the economy, and that is State and local governments who are being faced with significant budget challenges. Are you concerned that they might, indeed, collectively counteract what you and what we are trying to do to move the economy forward?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, as you know, the Federal Government has already provided a great deal of support to the State and local governments. Notwithstanding that, they are still in a cutting mode and seem likely to cut several hundred thousand jobs going forward. So that is a drag on the economy, no question about it. I suppose that one small piece of good news is that municipal bond markets are functioning reasonably well and rates are pretty low, so that most States are able to obtain funding if they need it. But it certainly is one of the factors which is reducing the recovery speed that we are experiencing."
"Senator Reed","The final sort of area of concern is you have spoken about and my colleagues have spoken about the need to address the deficit and the need to do things that will not contribute to the long-term deficit. Is it useful to think about those policies that add to the structural deficit versus those policies, such as unemployment compensation, that does not add to the structural deficit, that it is typically emergency spending that will be made up as the economy recovers, employment recovers? And in that regard, proposals to once again extend the Bush tax cuts would, I think, add to the structural deficit, since they are unconditional, but temporary assistance to States, temporary assistance to workers would not add to that structural deficit. Is that a fair way to look at it?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I think it is useful to distinguish cyclical and structural deficits and it is consistent with what I was saying before, is that right now, some fiscal support for the economy is probably a constructive thing, whereas over the medium term, we need to reduce our fiscal deficits, which is consistent with lowering the structural component of our deficits. But I would urge you not just to leave the structural deficit alone. I mean, it is too high and anything we can do to reduce the structural deficit, not just leave it alone, would be positive for the markets and would make it easier for the markets to accept any shorter-term actions you might want to take."
"Senator Reed","The unconditional extension of the Bush tax cuts would add further to a structural deficit that is much too high at the moment, is that your opinion?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the CBO would do that holding everything else constant. But I don't want to be interpreted as recommending one policy or another policy. As you know, I am not----"
"Senator Reed","Your colleague was not that reticent."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well----"
"Senator Reed","Or your predecessor."
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't think it is really my place to tell Congress which specific tax and spending policies to choose. I prefer to address the broader trajectory of fiscal stimulus."
"Senator Reed","Well, the trajectory would be made better or worse if those provisions were extended without condition?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, if no other changes were made, it would increase the cyclical, or maintain the cyclical and also increase the structural. Now, of course, there is always the possibility of taking other measures to offset whatever you do on any particular program."
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator."
"Senator Bunning",""
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke, for being here. There are so many things I would like to ask you. First of all, the job of the Federal Reserve is monetary policy. I want to clear that up."
"Mr. Bernanke","That is part of our job, but we also have financial stability responsibilities, in my view."
"Senator Bunning","But the main thrust of the Federal Reserve is to conduct the monetary policy of the United States of America."
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't think it is the exclusive----"
"Senator Bunning","I didn't say it was exclusive."
"Mr. Bernanke","It is very important and unique to the Federal Reserve to do monetary policy."
"Senator Bunning","If I got into monetary policy, you would get mad, as a Congressman."
"Mr. Bernanke","I think it is important for the Fed to have independence in making monetary policy."
"Senator Bunning","OK. I just want to reemphasize something that my Ranking Member said. Several news stories in the last few weeks, senior Federal Reserve officials, presumably you or someone close to you, have explained three actions the Fed could take to boost the economy if conditions get worse, and you have talked about them, lowering the interest reserve rates to zero, not \1/4\, but zero; extending the period of time for a near-zero Fed fund rate; and using proceeds from previous asset purchases to buy more mortgage-backed securities. However, many commentators and even some officials at the Fed doubt that these actions would have much of an impact. Do you share their concerns, and what are we going to do if these options do not work? Are you out of bullets?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I don't think so. We need to continue to evaluate those options. As I said, we are not prepared to take any specific steps in the near term, particularly since we are still also evaluating the recovery and the strength of the recovery. But I do think that there is some potential for some of those steps to be effective and we will continue to look at them, recognizing your concerns. You raised the issue of credit allocation, for example, with the MBS, and a number of members of the FOMC agree with your concern."
"Senator Bunning","In evaluating some monetary policy in your discussion of your own testimony, you said that you were looking for 3 to 3\1/2\ in 2011 for growth and 4 to 4\1/2\ in 2012. Is that accurate?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't think those were quite the numbers I had, but----"
"Senator Bunning","Oh, I am sorry----"
"Mr. Bernanke","----they are in the testimony. I think it is three-and-a-half----"
"Senator Bunning","I wrote them down."
"Mr. Bernanke","Three-and-a-half to four-and-a-half, I believe was the number."
"Senator Bunning","OK, that is close. Over the 2 years?"
"Mr. Bernanke","For 2011 and 2012, yes."
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. OK. And 7.5 percent unemployment by the year 2012?"
"Mr. Bernanke","By the end of 2012, 7.1."
"Senator Bunning","Seven-point-one, OK. You know, in this regulatory bill, we have given the Fed a lot more power. You know, in 1994, we gave the Fed a lot of power. We gave them total control over bank mortgages and mortgage brokers, 1994 law we passed, this Congress. And, you know, for 14 years, they didn't write a regulation. Not one. Not until you did after your second year in office. Now, if we give you all that power in this new regulatory bill that has just passed and you sit on your hands for 14 years, it isn't going to do us any good, is it?"
"Mr. Bernanke","You are absolutely right."
"Senator Bunning","Well, I am really concerned because we are at approximately 90 bank failures this year in the United States of America--90. I don't know what it is going to--what August, September, October, November, and December will bring. But the FDIC has to resolve those banks or the Comptroller of the Currency, or whichever is the regulator of that bank. Now we have handed you a job, in my mind, that is damn near impossible. You are going to have to pick and choose who is too big to fail. You and a group of so many people, but you particularly. And it is a subjective view. It is not--it doesn't say, these are the categories. It says that you should decide who is too big to fail. Is that accurate? Do you accept that as an accurate review of what is in the----"
"Mr. Bernanke","No, Senator. What we have to determine is which firms are systemically critical, but they will be subject to this resolution regime, which means that they will fail and the creditors will lose money."
"Senator Bunning","But it is subjective. It is not objective."
"Mr. Bernanke","I think it will be important for us to develop as many criteria, clear criteria as we possibly can."
"Senator Bunning","Oh, I think----"
"Mr. Bernanke","Obviously, it will be partly subjective, yes."
"Senator Bunning","OK. You know, we are $13 trillion going to $14 trillion in our debt. And if you count agency debt--that is public debt. If you count agency debt, just in Social Security, we are at $1 trillion. So if we add that to the $13 trillion, agency debt plus public, that is $14 trillion already. This year, we are not going to have a $14 trillion GDP, not unless we have an unbelievable recovery in the second half of this year. Isn't that pretty close to where Greece was?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I think that, first of all, adding the GSE debt is not entirely appropriate, because on the other side of the balance sheet are assets, mortgages, that are worth something."
"Senator Bunning","But don't we have to make good those trust fund mortgages like Social Security? Don't we, as a government, have to make good on those pieces of paper that are up in West Virginia?"
"Mr. Bernanke","But if we have 5 or 10 percent losses, we will still have 90 or 95 percent assets there. So it is not as if we had borrowed the $5 trillion of the outstanding MBS and had no assets to show for it."
"Senator Bunning","But we did spend the money."
"Mr. Bernanke","We spent several hundred billion, but not five trillion."
"Senator Bunning","Well, as the Chairman of the Social Security Subcommittee, when I was there, they were spending every penny they got from the Social Security Administration for other purposes. That means that we have to make up the difference. I just am worried where we are heading and I am worried about the tools that you have to counter where we are heading. I surely don't want us to not recover fully from this recession, because that is the--I mean, lack of jobs is the secret. We have got to create jobs. Small business creates jobs, and if this Congress doesn't act, we are not going to create those jobs. So I wish you good well."
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you."
"Senator Bunning","Good luck."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. Let me just say here, if we were in the status quo and had not passed this bill and the tools that existed 2 years ago, we would be a lot more vulnerable today than we are without this, so I thank you."
"Senator Bayh",""
"Senator Bayh","Mr. Chairman, this may be my last opportunity to interact with you in this capacity, and I just want to take this moment to thank you for your service to our country once again and to say it has been a pleasure working with you on some of these issues. My first question has to--there have been a lot of comments here about our budget deficits and debt, which is accurately described, as you pointed out, as unsustainable. I would like to ask about another unsustainable disequilibrium, and that is our current account deficit and the corresponding current account surpluses in China and other parts of the developing world. Many observers believe that it was this disequilibrium that gave rise to a glut of global capital that undergirded the asset bubble that led to some of the problems that we have seen. There were some signs it was beginning to be self- correcting. Savings rates in our country were going up. Consumption in China is rising. But the most recent data suggests that perhaps the current account imbalance is once again on the rise. So my question to you is: How concerned about this should we be? And given the apparent return to the status quo ante in terms of the gap, is this going to be self- correcting, or do other measures need to be taken?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, first, on the forecast, the current account deficit did drop from about 6 percent of GDP to about 3 percent of GDP, and it has increased slightly, but our view is that in the medium term it is not going to go back to where it was, that we have made some progress in that respect. But to continue with the progress, we need to continue to have global adjustment, and that essentially means that surplus countries like China and others need to increase their reliance on domestic demand and, where appropriate, have flexible exchange rates. And the United States has to do its part, and this ties back to your first comment about sustainability, which is that in order to reduce our current account deficit, we have to increase our national saving. Better fiscal position is part of that. Higher household and business saving is part of that. So that is an important imperative, one that the IMF and other international agencies continue to focus on, and I absolutely agree with you that if the current account deficit were to return to 5 or 6 percent of GDP, that would be a very worrisome situation."
"Senator Bayh","Well, let us hope we can get some bipartisan cooperation around here in getting our fiscal house in order, which will help with the savings issue. Let us hope the Chinese will continue to move in the area of currency flexibility. So as you look out to the future, you think that 3 percent--is that going to be about where it will be, do you think? And if so, that is--clearly not 5 or 6. Is that sustainable, the 3 percent rate?"
"Mr. Bernanke","For the next few years. That is our estimate, but it is just forecast."
"Senator Bayh","OK. I just saw the monthly figures last month, so hopefully that does not augur a return to something more----"
"Mr. Bernanke","We do not focus on bilateral trade deficits for U.S.-China. We look at the overall, and that is somewhat different."
"Senator Bayh","My second question has to do with the Greek debt crisis once again, and as you pointed out, the Europeans moved very aggressively and things seem to have calmed down a fair amount there. But I look with some alarm, even if they implement all these austerity measures that they are thinking about, and as you can see there is a fair amount of political turmoil around all that, it looks as if they are still going to be at about 130 percent or so of debt-to-GDP ratio, even after they have implemented all these steps. And just putting my political hat on, it could be pretty hard for them to go substantially beyond that. So that still looks like it is going to be pretty hard to sustain a situation like that. So I do not expect you to comment upon the likelihood of restructuring or anything like that. But you had mentioned that the whole episode, while it caused some disturbance, we have now kind of gone beyond that. So my question would be: In the event of an orderly restructuring of Greek debt at some point, I assume that it would also have only a marginal impact upon our own markets?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, what I think is important is that at least for the next few years, the Europeans have provided enough funding to assure no restructuring, no default, and that is important because we remain vulnerable in our recovery and in our financial markets to the kind of stress that would cause. So I am encouraged by the commitment of the Europeans in the large amount of funding. The other side of their program is also to create what the IMF would call conditionality, which is that they are within European mechanisms for achieving fiscal sustainability within their members. So the countries that receive assistance will also be under a lot of pressure from their peers within the euro zone or within the EU to make appropriate adjustments."
"Senator Bayh","That actually leads me to my final question. I will make one comment I do not expect you to respond to, but a skeptic might look at all this and say what was really at work here was a choice between an eventual orderly restructuring or a disorderly restructuring that could have been very destabilizing, and so what the Europeans are attempting to do is to recapitalize their banks and get them in better shape for the eventual haircut that may lie down the road at some point. So that is just an observation some have made about what is transpiring there, and hopefully the world economy will be in a stronger position and be willing to absorb all of that if, in fact, something like that happens. But we had a great hearing yesterday, and I want to thank you for making Mr. Tarullo available. His testimony was very candid, very insightful, very helpful, and that was about the importance--since we passed our financial regulatory response to the crisis, the importance of global harmonization and convergence about standards and enforcement mechanisms and all that. And you mentioned the--I am sure many of the Europeans, particularly the Germans, wish that they had focused a little bit more on some of the enforcement mechanisms with regard to government fiscal policy at the time they had formed the common currency. And so my question to you, Chairman, my final question would be: How important is it to our country that we continue to have, you know, harmonization of standards and particularly that there are enforcement mechanisms in place to ensure that those standards are abided by most of the time? Because that is going to be important to, I think, avoiding a recurrence of the crisis at some point. And, second, there are some competitiveness aspects with regard to this that could affect American institutions?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it is very important. We are not going to have perfect harmonization because countries are in different situations. They have different banking systems, different financial systems. But we are making good progress in negotiating with our colleagues a strengthening of capital liquidity standards that will help make our banking system more stable in the event of another stress event, as we recently saw. We do not really have binding mechanisms to enforce the agreements across borders. Every country applies the Basel standards within its own borders according to its own decisions. But we do work closely together and apply peer pressure and other mechanisms to try to keep the standards very similar, and, indeed, our very key objective over the next few months is to come up with an international agreement on capital liquidity standards that will both be tough--and the United States is leading the way in looking for a very tough set of rules--but also that will be acceptable and agreed upon across the major countries."
"Senator Bayh","Capital liquidity standards, resolution protocols, how we handle derivatives, all those kinds of things, it is just important that we harmonize as much as possible. Otherwise, we could see a repetition of the Greek phenomenon, not in the sovereign debt situation but when it comes to financial regulations. So we have taken some major steps here, and if we are going to really get the full fruits of that, it is important we try and get as much of the rest of the world to go along, and I thank you for your efforts in that regard. And, again, thank you for making Mr. Tarullo available, and thank you for your service to our country."
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much. Just on that point, we had regulatory arbitrage. You could end up with sovereign arbitrage in a sense if we do not try and harmonize those rules. That will be an important question."
"Senator Corker",""
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I was thinking, the last time the Federal Reserve Chairman was in and today, the difference between the way the Federal Reserve was being looked at 6 months ago and the outcome as it relates to this regulatory bill. He should have spiked the ball before he sat down, but I guess Federal Reserve Chairmen do not show emotion in that way. But I know things have changed tremendously from that time, and I certainly appreciate you coming back and would want to talk to you a little bit about the report that you gave obviously was disappointing to the markets. I think people are a little concerned about where we are. Do you discuss much in your meetings the probability of a double dip? And can you give us some sense as to the future there?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, we certainly try to talk about all contingencies, and the committee has identified some downside risks to the recovery, including problems of credit availability, small business, the high level of unemployment, which in turn has affected consumer confidence and their willingness to spend. So there are certainly some risks. But I would like to emphasize that our forecast, our expectation is still for a moderate recovery, the numbers I gave today of 3, 3\1/2\ percent, depending on the horizon, which will over time bring down the unemployment rate. So that is still our main scenario, that the economy will continue to grow and that the final demand, private final demand will take over from inventory building and fiscal policy as the drivers of growth."
"Senator Corker","The Ranking Member asked you a question, you know, obviously sort of the customary tools that you have or you have used in the past for easing, you know, with low rates, I think right after your testimony today the 10-year Treasury went to 292, rates are low, the Fed fund target is low, a lot of the sort of customary things are kind of gone. So he asked the question about what you may be thinking about, and you mentioned some nonconventional things. I know that then you alluded to some projections into the future that you all might use to maybe spur things along. I know in a 2002 speech you talked about the ability of the Fed to create inflation, and I am just wondering what you were saying, in essence, to the Ranking Member and what you might be referring to as it relates to projecting into the future."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, my 2002 speech pointed out that there were other things the Federal Reserve could do besides lowering the overnight interest rate to try to stimulate the economy, and those things included making commitments or statements about the length of time that rates would be low. They included purchasing securities. They included intervening in financial markets that were dysfunctional, as we did during the worst parts of the crisis. And those are all things that we actually did in the last couple of years. And I continue to believe that there are additional steps that could be taken, but obviously we do need to think about them very carefully and also to evaluate the state of the economy before taking any further action."
"Senator Corker","What would be the hurdle or threshold that you would have to cross over before you would begin tightening?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well that has certainly got to be a committee decision, but I would say that certainly one important criterion would be whether the recovery is sustainable, whether it is fading and not being self-propelling. If the recovery is continuing at a moderate pace, then the incentive to take extraordinary actions would be somewhat less. But certainly we would want to make sure that the economy continues to move back toward a more normal state of resource utilization."
"Senator Corker","So I know a lot of people up here have tried to sort of take you in whatever direction they think they would like to take you as it relates to the deficit. I want to sort of ask it in a neutral way, and that is, look, we have got a debt commission right now that is looking at long-term issues. It is bipartisan. No doubt in my opinion the administration has added to our concerns in that regard. But if you really look at where our debt is, a lot of that has just been building for years because of many entitlements and other things. As a matter of fact, when you look at where we are over the next 10 years, regardless of what the factors are, I think the American people look at deficit reduction almost academically today, and yet in the near term, we are talking about draconian things having to occur. I know Erskine Bowles talked about getting to 21 percent of GDP. Some of us would like to see it at 18 to 20 as it relates to expenditures. But even getting to that level is going to take draconian steps. So my question gets back to monetary policy. I think you all know full well where we are headed, and I think the American people have not really digested what it means for us to get our house in order. I am not sure if any of us really have digested fully what that means. But how does that impact the decisions that you all make as it relates to monetary policy? I mean, you know that is coming. You know it is going to be draconian to deal with it in an appropriate way. How is it affecting your internal discussions as it relates to monetary policy?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it is a risk factor. Depending on how markets respond to developments in the debt and deficit, it could potentially be a drag on recovery if interest rates were to rise, for example. But in the near term, we are mostly focused on the business cycle, the state of the economy, the level of inflation. For the most part, I think of these fiscal issues as being medium term. For example, the objective of the Commission is to get the deficit down I think to about 3 percent, 3\1/2\ percent by the middle of the decade, something like that. And that is the kind of objective we want. We want to get the deficit down to a point where the ratio of debt to GDP sort of stabilizes, and that would, I think, be very good for confidence in the markets."
"Senator Corker","Evan Bayh mentioned at the hearing we had yesterday with Mr. Tarullo, he did a good job presenting. One of the things that we--in preparing for the meeting, we had somebody come in who is dealing with a lot of the foreign ministers and others, with the G-20, somebody that I think is respected by both sides of the aisle. And one of the things that he mentioned was the fact there was a lot of discussion by people in other countries regarding the legislation that we did just pass, and the fact that many of them saw the opportunity for jobs to migrate out of this country into theirs or for their particular institutions to fill in the gaps, to be able to take on additional business because of some of the things that we have done. I know that you and others are going to attempt to assure that we have sort of a worldwide set of regulations that work together. One of the things he specifically spoke to was the Volcker Rule, and there was a lot of resistance around the world community regarding that. And I am just wondering what your thoughts are on that and, you know, is there a concern in your mind today about us not achieving that and the fact that we may, in fact, lose financial system jobs here in the country?"
"Chairman Dodd","Just answer that quickly, if you would."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the Volcker Rule was, I think, constructed in a reasonable way in that it allows continued hedging and market-making activities, which are critical activities for banks and other financial institutions. I think it is evident that the European banks will not adopt the same rule because they are universal banks and they have a different mode of operation. But our banks have been able to compete with European and other banks pretty effectively even though there have been differences in powers and other requirements. I do not see a major change in that competitiveness."
"Chairman Dodd","Very good. Senator Akaka."
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I want to add my welcome to Chairman Bernanke back to the Committee. We share a commitment to improving the lives of working families by better educating, protecting and empowering consumers. This is a great day for America and the American people. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law today. One section of the act that will provide economic opportunities for working families is Title 12, which authorized programs intended to improve access to mainstream financial institutions and affordable small loans. Please share with the Committee the challenges that the unbanked and underbanked are confronted with, and explain why it is important that more people utilize banks and credit unions."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, you have been a leader in this area for a very long time, and, of course, you are well aware that many people, particularly in many cases immigrants or minorities, are utilizing nonmainstream financial institutions, like payday lenders or check cashers, and that frequently that is very costly for them and may involve getting trapped in a cycle of debt where they have to continue taking out more loans at high interest rates in order to pay back their previous loans. So I think it is very important--and you and I have had this discussion on a number of occasions--to bring the broader public into the mainstream financial system, not only for deposits but for credit, for saving, for all the important functions of the financial system for families. I agree that there are some useful things in the bill that will address that, including financial literacy provisions as well. I believe the Consumer Protection Bureau will have some education and literacy components. That is very complementary. The Consumer Bureau will certainly be active in trying to eliminate deceptive, misleading advertising or products, but that alone is really not sufficient for people to make the best use of financial markets and financial products. They have to be educated as well. And, you know, I think that is very positive that we are going to increase the commitment to that training."
"Senator Akaka","Thank you. Chairman Bernanke, as you mentioned financial literacy, the recently enacted law includes a provision to establish the Office of Financial Education within the newly created Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection. The office will craft a strategy to develop and implement initiatives to improve financial literacy among consumers. What do you think must be done to ensure that consumers are able to make informed financial decisions?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, as I indicated, I think this is a very important component of consumer protection, and I look forward to seeing the proposals and the ideas that come out of this office. I am very happy about the trend that we see across the country that more and more high schools are offering financial literacy courses. We have more organizations like Junior Achievement and others that are working with schools to increase financial literacy. I would have to say in all honesty that there are still some very difficult challenges in figuring out how best to educate people. Many of the programs that have been tried in the past have not been so successful based in terms of subsequent testing or evaluation of people who have taken those courses. So there are some difficult problems still in figuring out how best to transmit this information, how best to make sure people absorb it. One of the best ways to do that is to put financial literacy in the context of actual decisions that people make. If people are involved in buying a house or a car, they are much more involved and much more interested in the issues than they are if they are learning something in a high school class perhaps. So counseling and other kinds of support for people making financial decisions might be a good direction. But as I said, I applaud that the bill did not neglect financial literacy, and I hope that the Federal Reserve will be able to cooperate with the Bureau. As you know, we have our own programs, and we will continue to press education in this area."
"Senator Akaka","Chairman Bernanke, many hard-working immigrants send a portion of their earnings to relatives living abroad. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act establishes long overdue requirements for simple, meaningful, and relevant disclosures about the cost of sending remittances. Additionally, the act requires that the Federal Reserve work with the Department of Treasury to expand the use of the automated clearinghouse system and other payment mechanisms for remittance transfers to foreign countries, and I look forward to continuing to work with you on this important issue. Mr. Chairman, what are the benefits of having consumers utilize banks and credit unions for remittances? And what must be done to encourage greater use of the mainstream financial institutions for sending remittances?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, this is an issue I have spoken on in the past. We were just speaking about ways of getting particularly immigrant communities to get them into the mainstream financial system. Remittances, which is a very common practice for immigrants who are sending money home, is one natural way to get people into the mainstream financial system, and we have encouraged and we have seen many financial institutions improve their remittance services and use that as a way of attracting the interest of minority or immigrant groups. So I think it is a very useful way to make the transition from nonmainstream to mainstream finance. So we do support that, and you mentioned the ACH. The Federal Reserve has been involved a long time in developing better ways of transmitting remittances, and we have agreements with the Bank of Mexico to reduce the cost and increase the efficiency of remittances to that country. So we certainly are eager and prepared to expand those services, as is required by the new legislation."
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much for your responses,"
"Chairman Bernanke"," Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much."
"Senator Gregg",""
"Senator Gregg","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. It is a pleasure to see you. I appreciate the good job you do for this Nation, and I am glad you are still independent. Obviously, you have brought us some information that is in some ways not all that optimistic: unusual uncertainty. Interesting term. Let me try to get to a couple of hopefully positive certainties. One would be if we were to do--if you look at the banking financial institutions today, the major ones, and you reflected in the terms of a stress test, which is what the Europeans are going through and what we have been through, do any of our banks have stress test issues of any significance right now?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I am not quite sure what you mean by stress test issues, but we did do stress tests of 19 of the largest banks----"
"Senator Gregg","I am talking about the largest banks."
"Mr. Bernanke","----in the United States, and some of them were required to raise additional capital, all of which did. Since then, large banks have become increasingly profitable. Their losses on most categories of loans seem to have peaked, and in some cases they are reducing their reserves against loan losses. So the overall capital levels and the quality of the capital of large banks is certainly much improved over the last couple of years."
"Senator Gregg","The Chairman referred to an extraordinary quantity of excess reserves, which would imply that the banking system is fairly aggressively capitalized right now. Do you see that as being true? I mean the major banking system."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the excess reserves, which is about $1 trillion held by the Federal Reserve, does not count--it is an asset. It does not count as capital. It is really a form of liquidity, and it helps to ensure that banks have all the access to liquid funds that they might need, and that it is another belt-and-suspender protection for the banking system. They have so far been reluctant to make use of those reserves, probably because they view the demand for credit as being weak or the quality of borrowers as being weak, or in some cases because they are uncertain about how much capital they will need in the longer term and are, therefore, being cautious about putting their capital to work. But capital reserves are different quantities."
"Senator Gregg","But they all reflect the strength of the system?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the excess reserves in particular, which are created by Federal Reserve purchases of securities in the open market, are a strength of the system in the sense that they ensure that banks have easy access to large amounts of liquidity. But it is a separate issue from capital."
"Senator Gregg","Well, I guess my point is: Isn't our financial structure in pretty good shape right now compared to where it was a year and a half ago? And isn't it moving in the right direction? And so when you say ``unusual uncertainties,'' isn't at least one certainty that at least that element of the crisis which we confronted a year and a half ago has been settled out and is moving in the right direction?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes, I took note of that in my remarks, that both the banking system and the financial markets more generally are in considerably better shape than they were 2 years ago."
"Senator Gregg","Senator Reed referred to $2 trillion on asset balance sheets across this country in corporate America. Now, I have heard this refrain a series of times from the other side of the aisle now. It is almost as if that $2 trillion should be ours, it should be the Federal Government's and we should get it reallocated right now because it is sitting there. But isn't it really a reflection of the fact that we are poised for some positive activity if confidence can return to the markets? In other words, there are resources for capital expansion and for economic expansion sitting on the books."
"Mr. Bernanke","That is right. The availability of funding or credit is not a constraint for most large firms."
"Senator Gregg","What is the constraint, of course, is the unusual uncertainties that are facing American business today, and small business especially, but all business, and that is that we are facing a Government that has got a long-term debt which is unsustainable, and so there is a huge uncertainty as a result of that. In the short term, it is a two-step dance. We understand that in the short term there is a stimulus event here that is occurring. But in the long term, we have an unsustainable debt. Is that not true?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Gregg","And that within the next year, it is the administration's position that major tax events will occur which will significantly dampen the creation of capital. Specifically, capital gains rates will go up by 50 percent; dividend tax rates will go up by 150 percent on some earners; and top marginal rates will go up from 35 percent to 42 percent, which dampens capital formation. Doesn't a major tax event like that in a slow economy dampen capital formation?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, again I do not want to be recommending for or against specific taxes, but obviously, as you look at the Tax Code, thinking about this not only in the short term but in terms of demand stimulus and long term in terms of efficiency and effectiveness, I hope you look at it from both perspectives."
"Senator Gregg","Well, if you tax the formation of capital over the next 6 to 8 months at a rate which is 50 percent higher than it is today or 150 percent higher than it is today, you are probably going to slow economic activity. That is rhetorical. And then, of course, you have the issue of the financial reform bill. I mean, there is going to be a period here where people are not going to--a lot of the banking industry is not going to know what sort of capital reserves it should actually be holding, which will constrain its willingness to go out and lend; where the derivatives market is going to be frothy, to be kind, because it will not really know where it is ending up and what type of derivatives have to have margins; and where under the Volcker Rule a large amount of proprietary trading which used to be available will no longer be available to American banks, although ironically it will be available to international banks. All of that will contract credit to some degree in the market, will it not, over the next 6 months to 2 years as people sort out their responsibilities here?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Those are legitimate concerns, and for that reason the Federal Reserve is going to do the best we can to get these things resolved as quickly as possible."
"Senator Gregg","So if you want to look at what is really causing--maybe the uncertainty that is causing this $2 trillion to stay on the balance sheets, it is the fiscal policies of the Government."
"Mr. Bernanke","Policy uncertainties are no doubt part of it, but there is also economic uncertainties, just uncertainty about how labor markets will evolve, how consumer spending will evolve, how the global economy will evolve and so on. So there is a lot of uncertainty, and that is certainly an issue."
"Senator Gregg","If you were doing a formula, I think the percentage that would be assigned to Federal fiscal policy would be fairly high for creating uncertainty as a result of our unwillingness to face the long-term debt problems we have, the tax policies which are coming at us which will penalize capital formation, and the uncertainty about what sort of capital you have to have on your books in order to make loans in the financial institutions for at least the next 6 months to 2 years."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just point out before I turn to Sherrod Brown, because we are losing some members, but I say this to the staff in the room, as well, in consultation with Senator Shelby, I would like to be able to move our nominees for the Federal Reserve out of committee before the August break, and I know they were with us a few days ago. So if my colleagues have questions for them in addition to what they asked during the confirmation hearing, if you haven't submitted questions, I would urge you to do so. I haven't scheduled anything yet. I am obviously going to stay in touch with all of you. Just let me know whether or not you have had questions answered or not so that we could try and get those done before--at least out of the committee. I am not trying to get it up before the full Senate, obviously, before we leave, but at least set it up. So I would urge you to submit questions if you have them, to members, and I thank you for that."
"Senator Brown",""
"Senator Brown","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, welcome. Last time you were here, several months ago, you and I talked about manufacturing, its role in our economy, that manufacturing, typically automotive but manufacturing generally is the vehicle, if you will--pardon my pun there--to lead us out of recession. I mentioned to you that 30 years ago, more than a quarter of our GDP was manufacturing and financial services made up only about a tenth of our GDP, and in the last 30 years, we have seen that flip and we know where that got us. It got us a shrinking middle class. It got us our financial crisis, in part, not quite that simple, but we know that if we don't make things in this country, that it is a significant problem of getting out of a recession and beyond that. Also in the last several months, the International Trade Commission, signed of on more or less by the President and the Commerce Department, made two rulings, one of them on Chinese tires, one of them on--that was last fall. Since you have been in front of this committee, they made a country on oil country tubular steel. Each of those rulings found that the Chinese weren't playing fair on subsidies, dumping. Each of those rulings resulted immediately in American companies in my part of the country and beyond, in tires, especially, hiring several hundred people. Back in December 2006, and this gets me to comments that Senator Bayh touched on, in December 2006 at the U.S.-China Strategic Economic Dialogue, you described China's undervalued currency, quote, ``as an effective subsidy for Chinese exporters.'' You know how many jobs depend on our trade deficit, or we hope shrinking deficit--not a lot of evidence for that long term that I can see, although you touched on that. But explain whether you believe, in your words, effective subsidy is still in place and whether the G-20's commitment to rebalance growth can be achieved with this apparently slow and gradual appreciation of the yuan."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, this is related to my answer to Senator Bayh about the current account deficit. There are two tools to address imbalances. One is exchange rate flexibility. The other is to rebalance your economy so that it is more dependent on domestic demand rather than on exports. On the latter, the Chinese have made some progress. Through fiscal policy and other policy actions, they have increased somewhat their dependence on their own domestic demand rather than excessive reliance on exports, to some extent. I mean, there has been progress in that direction. On the exchange rate they have recently begun again to undertake this controlled float that they have. Obviously, it hasn't moved the exchange rate very far, and I would agree with you that we would like to see them move it considerably further so that it would both create a level playing field, as your concern addresses, but also from the perspective of China, to give them a more balanced domestic economy and more independence of their monetary policy. So it is really something that is important for both sides."
"Senator Brown","One thing China seems to understand better than we when they make these very, very small baby steps on currency appreciation is time. Thirty year ago, Zhou Enlai was asked what he thought of the French Revolution and he said it was too early to tell. It just seems to me that China plays us out on this currency and continues its--it is, as you say, an effective subsidy. I assume you haven't changed your mind that it is an effective subsidy. You would use that term again?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Brown","OK. Would you agree with many, many economists who have been parts of both Democratic and Republican administrations that the subsidy approaches 40 percent?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't know exactly. There is a range of estimates that are----"
"Senator Brown","Would you give me your range of estimate?"
"Mr. Bernanke","The numbers that you see in the literature range between 10 and 30 percent."
"Senator Brown","No, they range--many say 40."
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't think that is the center of the distribution but there is a wide range."
"Senator Brown","Well, 10 to 30, I am not asking the center-- "
"Mr. Bernanke","Right. Sorry."
"Senator Brown","----ten to 40, the center is still not 40. You are pretty good at math, so what is the range and where do you come down? I want you to be more specific than 10 to something."
"Mr. Bernanke","Could I come back to you with some numbers?"
"Senator Brown","Could you discuss it a little more now? So the range is--I am sorry I interrupted you. The range is something. Give me the range that you see----"
"Mr. Bernanke","So the range----"
"Senator Brown","----and where you might----"
"Mr. Bernanke","----that I have seen through a variety of ways of calculating it is generally, in my recollection, somewhere between 10 and 30 percent."
"Senator Brown","OK. Does that mean that Chinese goods sold into this country are underpriced 10 to 30 percent?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes, holding constant some other things like wages, which have started to rise, for example. But broadly speaking, yes."
"Senator Brown","And doesn't that mean that it should be no surprise we have this sort of this huge bilateral trade deficit with China?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it is a function both of the exchange rate, and I am not disagreeing with you, but it is also a function of savings and investment policies. And again, China has made some progress toward increasing the dependence of its economy on its own domestic demand."
"Senator Brown","If we were to enforce two issues where there have been petitions through the Commerce Department, one on coated paper, another on aluminum, two actually fairly major industries in the country, if we were to make the decision and enforce the laws that there is, in fact, as we do this study, that there is, in fact--or this investigation--a currency subsidy, if you will, is it fair to assert that absolutely would mean job growth, that it would mean job growth in this country, our country?"
"Mr. Bernanke","There would certainly be a short-run effect on those particular industries, but I would point out that there is not much correlation over a longer period of time between overall employment or unemployment and our current account deficit, that where resources are not being utilized in one industry, they tend over time to be deployed in other industries. So maybe there is some misallocation across industry, but overall employment doesn't depend too much on the current account."
"Senator Brown","That is a story that would ring hollow to lots of cities in my State, large and small alike, like your city in South Carolina, understanding how capital moves and families can't often. But if, in fact, and I will wrap up with this, Mr. Chairman. I see my time has expired. Current account deficit notwithstanding, if the currency is so, your term, if the undervalued currency is an effective subsidy, doesn't that always mean lost jobs in a bilateral relationship when trade is going back and forth--more back than forth--on these commodities or these manufactured goods?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It could mean that there is a transfer of jobs across different industries. It doesn't necessarily mean overall, that jobs are lost."
"Senator Brown","But when the overall net effect--you can talk about it is not like we are losing jobs in paper, we are losing jobs in chemicals, we are losing jobs in steel, we are losing jobs in aluminum, we are losing jobs in glass and we are picking it up in other manufacturing. I mean, the net loss is manufacturing writ large, correct?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, what is happening is that the jobs are being picked up in nontraded areas, in goods and services that we don't trade abroad."
"Senator Brown","Perhaps. Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator."
"Senator Tester",""
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Welcome, Ben. I appreciate you being here. I want to step back to some questions that were asked earlier, and you said--I think it was in response to Chairman Dodd, but it may have been in your opening statement, where you talked about the expenditures being made now were necessary to keep the economy propped up and keep it going, and correct me if I am wrong. And then another question was asked shortly thereafter. You had said that the deficits are unsustainable right now. Those seem to be competing statements, although they can go together. The question is, from your perspective, the expenditures we are doing right now, regardless of the deficit, are necessary?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Broadly speaking, yes. I don't think that there is really much benefit to trying to reduce the 2010 deficit substantially. I think that that is supporting the economy. Those two statements are not inconsistent. It has to do with the timeframe."
"Senator Tester","OK. I just want to make sure that that is the case, because I think sometimes we interpret them as being diametrically opposed when they are not."
"Mr. Bernanke","I would much prefer to see consolidation or cuts over the medium term as opposed to immediately."
"Senator Tester","Let me get to that, because we all know that large and unsustainable deficits, as you have pointed out in the past, ultimately, we are going to have to make some tough decisions. Ultimately, we are going to have to make some choices, none of which will be easy, whether you are talking about cutting expenditures or increasing the income. What are the indicators that you would use to determine when we start addressing those issues, and is today the day we start or when do we start?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I think if you look at, for example, the CBO and other projections, they have deficit-to-GDP ratios from, say, 2013 to 2020, somewhere in the four to 7 percent range. Assuming that the economy is back to close to full employment by 2013 or 2014, that four to 7 percent is the medium-term structural deficit and that is too high to keep the debt-to-GDP ratio constant over time. It is going to lead to an unsustainable situation. So in particular, the Deficit Commission has been tasked to bring the deficit down to 3 or 3\1/2\ percent, something in that range, by 2015. I think we ought to be shooting for a sustainable path, 3 percent, maybe even less, of GDP as a deficit starting 2 or 3 years from now and going out for the next decade, would be one broad trajectory that would be reassuring to the financial markets."
"Senator Tester","Is 3 to 3\1/2\ percent of GDP sustainable?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It depends on lots of different things, but you don't have to have a zero deficit for sustainability. You just need the deficit to be roughly equal to the interest payments that you make. So if interest payments are 2 to 3 percent of GDP, then a permanent deficit of that amount is, in fact, sustainable. Yes."
"Senator Tester","OK. The G-20 met recently and they set up a timeframe for deficit reduction. Do you think that that timeframe is appropriate?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It is 2015, I believe?"
"Senator Tester","I think half the deficit by 2013."
"Mr. Bernanke","A majority of them are emerging market economies, many of which are actually growing pretty quickly right now, so I am not sure I would want to impose a single standard on all the members of the G-20. The important thing is the overall trajectory. Is there some evidence that the debt will begin to stabilize within the next few years?"
"Senator Tester","OK. Investors have been--I mean, the Treasury bonds have been pretty solid, and that is maybe an understatement. How long do you think this will remain this way, and is it dependent on what is going on in Europe right now that they are solid, or is there another reason for it?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, there are a number of reasons why the yield is under 3 percent----"
"Senator Tester","Right."
"Mr. Bernanke","----currently. They include low inflation expectations, low growth expectations, but very importantly, also safe haven effects. That is, the U.S. dollar or U.S. debt is considered to be very liquid, very safe instrument, and given the amount of risks in the financial markets around the world, many investors have decided to acquire U.S. dollars, including many foreign governments who want to hold dollar reserves. So those are some of the reasons. Clearly, the bond market at this point is not focused on long-term deficits, at which point it would become more concerned. It is very hard to know."
"Senator Tester","Some have said that there is going to be-- there is strong potential for another dip due to commercial real estate and other things. What impact does that have on the Treasury bonds?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, just to be clear----"
"Senator Tester","If it would happen."
"Mr. Bernanke","Just to be clear, the Federal Reserve's forecast is for moderate recovery. But if, for whatever reason, there were a significant slowdown, then presumably Treasury yields would fall further."
"Senator Tester","OK. So, I mean, so Treasury doesn't--and I am happy to hear you say yes to this question--Treasury doesn't see another dip due to commercial markets?"
"Mr. Bernanke","The Federal Reserve?"
"Senator Tester","The Federal Reserve, I mean. I am sorry."
"Mr. Bernanke","No, we don't think that a double----"
"Senator Tester","That is good."
"Mr. Bernanke","----is a high probability event."
"Senator Tester","That is good news. You had talked about--in fact, it was Ranking Member Shelby who had some questions on the credit crunch and the reason for it. You had talked about lower demand. You had talked about collateral, the value decline. You talked about regulators being especially cautious. I want to touch onto that. You said that you were instructing regulators to be more--have more consistency in their regulation. Consistency goes to stability goes to better lending. How are you evaluating that?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, first, in terms of what we are doing, we have put out a lot of specific guidance in terms of how you go about making these evaluations with lots of practical real world examples, and we have put out guidances about commercial real estate, about small business, and a number of other key areas. And we have been following that up with very intensive training of the examiners to make sure they understand that there needs to be an appropriate balance between appropriate prudence and making loans to creditworthy borrowers. In terms of evaluation, we are doing this a number of ways. We are gathering more data. For example, we are now gathering on a quarterly basis lending to small businesses instead of annually. We are contributing questions to the NFIB's Survey of Small Businesses to try to understand what problems they see. Very importantly, as I mentioned in my testimony, we have had a series of 40 meetings around the country, meeting with banks, small businesses, and other relevant parties to talk about the issues, and we have put together an addendum to my testimony which includes a number of findings and recommendations to address this. So we have been both qualitatively and quantitatively trying to assess the effects of our guidances and training on bank activity."
"Senator Tester","OK. Just one last thing, Mr. Chairman, if I might, and then I will throw it over, because it is on this issue. I continually, when I go into the State of Montana every weekend or when I come back here, I am continually getting calls from banks, community banks, that are saying the regulation isn't consistent. It is not consistent between agencies. It is not applied across the board within agencies in a consistent way. I said, you know what? I would love to call these guys up. And they said, don't use our name. If you use our name, it will be worse. There has got to be a way that you, being the person you are, can go out and dig down and get that information, because quite honestly, I believe the banks because I hear it from every one of them. So if you could do that, I would certainly appreciate it."
"Mr. Bernanke","I invite those comments. If they are unwilling to talk to their Federal Reserve Bank in their district, we have an Ombudsman here in Washington who will be happy to take those comments, and our Bank Supervision Department will be happy to take those comments. So we want to hear that."
"Senator Tester","Once again, thank you for being here,"
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you."
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Bennet."
"Senator Bennet","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing, and to the Ranking Member, thank you, and thank you for being back here, Mr. Chairman. I actually want to pick up right where Senator Tester left off, because the last time we were together, I asked whether or not we might have some metrics where we could start to look at things and be able to distinguish between lending that is not happening because of loan demand, lending that is not happening because of regulators' overreach, lending that is not happening because we are in a different leverage environment, all that stuff, and I was pleased to see that in the addendum you have talked about it a few times. There is a section on research and data, what you are going to start collecting, what you have heard from people that might make it more meaningful, and for the life of me, there are a million things in here that I don't know why we haven't done already, but we haven't. We haven't had the focus on small business lending that we need to have. I don't think the administration has had the focus on it that they need to have. But my question is--and my anecdotal evidence in Colorado continues to be exactly the same as Senator Tester's, which is that small businesses that assert that they can pay on their loans can't get credit, and banks are saying that the reason they can't extend the credit is because the regulators have swung too far over to one side. It is a consistent theme. Every now and then, you hear somebody say, well, there is not really loan demand, or they will say, Michael, look and see if people are actually paying off their letters of credit and they are returning capital to banks. So my question for you is, you talked about the training and the guidance, wanting people to take a balanced approach. In the evidence that you have collected so far that you were just talking about, what is the evidence? What does it tell you about what is happening here?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well----"
"Senator Bennet","Or do we not even now----"
"Mr. Bernanke","I don't know if I could give you a completely final answer on this. I think we are pretty confident that a lot of the reduction in lending is not regulatory constraint, that a lot of it has to do either with reduced demand from small businesses or from the fact that their financial and economic position has been weakened so that it is more difficult for them to get a loan with the tighter standards which now exist in the banking system. So that is a big part of it. I don't have definitive answers for you that you would want on the regulatory, but let me give you an example of something which we are currently doing that I didn't mention to Senator Tester, which is we have done baseline analyses, evaluations. We have gone out to 200 or more banks and asked them how they dealt with commercial real estate problems, workouts, relending, refinancing, and so on, and we are doing a follow-up subsequent to our guidance on this issue. And what we want to try to do is identify whether there have been changes in behavior. So we are trying to get the metrics that you are----"
"Senator Bennet","Is your sense that the--and what I hear a lot is we used to reserve 10 percent. The requirement is now 12 percent, or it was 9 percent, it is now 12 percent. Do you think that the regulators are striking the right balance there?"
"Mr. Bernanke","I am sorry, I didn't understand the question."
"Senator Bennet","They are saying that the assets that they have to reserve that they can't lend have increased from, I think it is 9 percent to 12 percent."
"Mr. Bernanke","There is no simple rule like that. There is an evaluation of the overall quality of the loan, which depends on a variety of things, so there is not----"
"Senator Bennet","OK. They feel like--in my State, they feel like there is a simple rule like that."
"Mr. Bernanke","So there are data. Some of the data that we look at are a survey we do of 100 banks of loan officers and ask them whether they are tightening or easing standards, and they have been tightening for quite a while. So some of this surely is the banks' decision to tighten their lending standards. Now, recently, we have seen a cessation of tightening. That is, standards are no longer getting tighter. In some places, they are getting a little bit easier. So there is some stabilization there. We have also seen that small business lending is still dropping, but more slowly than before. So there are some indications that credit is becoming more available. Whether that has to do with regulatory decisions or whether it has to do with the fact that the economy is looking a little better is hard to say."
"Senator Bennet","I wanted to, just before I lose my chance here, also talk a little bit about the deficit and the debt situation. You talked about how the markets need to see a compelling--that we are taking it seriously. You have testified to that before. Actually, they are not the only ones. My daughters have heard me talk about this so much that they are enormously agitated about this question themselves, because they don't want to make these decisions that we are failing to make. But Congress after Congress after Congress have failed to make the decisions, and we now have $13 trillion debt on the balance sheet. What is appalling about it, among other things, is that we really don't have much to show for it, I don't think. We haven't invested in this country's infrastructure, for example. We haven't built the 21st century energy infrastructure that we need. So the hole is actually even greater than I think we imagine from a fiscal point of view. You mentioned at the very beginning the difficulty of having one Congress bind the next Congress and the next Congress. What kind of thing do you think about when you are not here but in your office that we could do that would show that we are serious about this, that we are actually putting ourselves on a path of sustainability, knowing that we can't fix this overnight? What is it that we--what will do we need to demonstrate and how do we need to demonstrate it? I realize--I am not asking for specific policies, but what do you say to yourself?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Congress has over time moved toward multiyear budgeting plans, and you try to look at projected trajectories over a 10-year window. So those kinds of exercises, where you are looking at how programs will affect the deficit over a 10-year period is certainly one way to demonstrate commitment, and a future Congress could reverse what you did, but they at least would have to take active action to do that, and you could demonstrate your commitment to gradual deficit reduction over a period of time. At some point, you are going to have to address in some way or other the unfunded liabilities associated with entitlements. The problem there is that it doesn't seem likely that you would want to change those for people who are near retirement."
"Senator Bennet","Right."
"Mr. Bernanke","Even any changes you would make today are going to only take effect relatively far in the future. And so part of the challenge is to find things that will affect the trajectory, say, between now and 2020, which is what the Commission is looking at."
"Senator Bennet","Mr. Chairman, may I ask one more question, or are we done----"
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, very quickly, if you can."
"Senator Bennet","Do you think--one of the things that I worry about is that as we recover, we forget that we have got these obligations that we have got to deal with, and people will cut taxes and not pay for it or spend money and not pay for it. Do you think that it would be possible to create a legislative instrument to help manage our deficit to a percentage of GDP, that we would be saying to ourselves that we have a policy objective that says, by such and such a year, the budget deficit can't be greater than 3 percent of GDP or lower?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It is certainly possible. There have been a variety of different kinds of rules over the years that Congress has tried to impose on itself, sometimes successful, sometimes less. You have a created Congressional Budget Office, which is a neutral arbiter and which has been very useful in trying to make sure people are making an honest assessment of the costs of their programs or tax cuts. So, yes, I think there probably are a range of ways of constraining future deficits, and if you look around the world, many countries either have constitutional provisions or they have a nonpartisan office that enforces certain constraints. Of course, the States have balanced budget requirements which are not perfectly enforced, but do constrain their spending, obviously."
"Senator Bennet","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator."
"Senator Menendez",""
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke, for your service. I always believe the starting point always has consequence, and I hear a lot about spending, which I agree is a challenge and something we need to tackle, but I also hear it in the abstract. So let me just do a very quick history line with you. You came to us in the end of 2008 with Secretary Paulson and you said to this Congress, we need to act or otherwise we will have financial institutions collapse and that collapse will mean an entire systemic risk to the entire country and maybe we will even have a global financial meltdown. Is that true?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Absolutely."
"Senator Menendez","So that was necessary."
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Menendez","And then we asked you in the beginning of 2009, when President Obama--that happened before President Obama took office. And then President Obama takes office in 2009 and we have an economy that has flat-lined, is that fair to say?"
"Mr. Bernanke","You have a----"
"Senator Menendez","An economy that was flat-lined, with absolutely no----"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Menendez","We had negative growth."
"Mr. Bernanke","Very weak, yes."
"Senator Menendez","We were losing three-quarters of a million jobs in January and February and March of 2009."
"Mr. Bernanke","That is correct."
"Senator Menendez","We had negative GDP growth, is that correct?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Menendez","And then we needed to stimulate that economy because it just had no private sector activity, for all intents and purposes, is that correct?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Menendez","And, therefore, that was necessary."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I never specifically endorsed any particular program, size, composition, and so on----"
"Senator Menendez","But you then assisted to stimulate the economy."
"Mr. Bernanke","----but stimulus was certainly beneficial, or certainly was useful in the context of the weak economy we had at the beginning of last year."
"Senator Menendez","Well, if we had done nothing, would it have been worse?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Probably, yes."
"Senator Menendez","OK. So it was necessary. So I have a little difficulty in understanding some of our colleagues from their starting point. Let me ask you now, now, if we do absolutely nothing, what is the economy going to look like?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well----"
"Senator Menendez","What is the job picture going to look like?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Our baseline analysis is that there will not be another large fiscal stimulus, and based on that, we have come up with the forecast which I reported today which is for moderate recovery."
"Senator Menendez","But you are also looking at monetary policy as a way, possibly, to see if you can further stimulate--my word--the economy, not?"
"Mr. Bernanke","That is correct."
"Senator Menendez","Well, that is an action that will have somewhat of a cost. So it is--we have choices here. We could have done nothing, spent nothing and had a global financial meltdown, or we could have acted and prevented that because the consequences would have been far greater. A global financial meltdown means a depression in the 21st century. That would have been far different than the depression that you studied under Roosevelt, would that not be true?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I have never objected to the spending that was done to address----"
"Senator Menendez","I know you haven't. I am just trying to get the record here straight."
"Mr. Bernanke","Right. I think that the fact that we have a 10-percent GDP deficit this year is completely understandable given what we have been through."
"Senator Menendez","So we are looking at debt and deficits now, and I agree we need to tackle that. So adding another $680 billion to the debt, is that a good idea?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It depends on----"
"Senator Menendez","Well----"
"Mr. Bernanke","Everything else being equal, raising the debt is a negative."
"Senator Menendez","So raising the debt is a negative. And if I do that in a way in which I don't offset that, that would be a negative, would it not be?"
"Mr. Bernanke","From the debt perspective, yes."
"Senator Menendez","From the debt perspective."
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes."
"Senator Menendez","Now, but that is, in essence, what some of our colleagues want us to do in extending the tax cuts that are expiring and not pay for them. And so I just don't understand how we reconcile those views. Is it permissible never to pay for tax cuts than what they drain the Treasury of? Is that a good fiscal policy?"
"Mr. Bernanke","If you don't control the deficits over time, eventually, the markets won't lend to you at reasonable interest rates."
"Senator Menendez","Now, speaking about lending at reasonable interest rates, if we continue--you know, my colleagues from Montana and Colorado, I could echo in New Jersey the reality of what banks tell us, particularly community banks and others. So it gets to be a little wide swath of the same set of statements that are being made, which always make me think a little bit about the truthfulness in terms of there seems to be more voracity when I continuously get from a wide range of entities the same answer. But if you can borrow from the Federal Reserve at, what is it, one point?"
"Mr. Bernanke","The discount window is 75 basis points, but we are not making many loans through that."
"Senator Menendez","But if you can borrow incredibly low and then go buy Treasury bills, why would you take risk to make loans?"
"Mr. Bernanke","It is still profitable. If you can make a good loan, it is still profitable. Buying Treasury bills with short-term money is not an arbitrage. It is a risky way of making short-term profits at the risk of long-term capital losses."
"Senator Menendez","Let me ask you this. Why is it that we hear from bank after bank after bank after bank that in the regulatory aspect, we are telling, for example, in commercial loans that are performing--performing--that, however, they need to be recapitalized. Well, if we do that, we are going to dry up an enormous amount of capital, especially as we are looking at a commercial mortgage market problem that I think is going to be incredibly troublesome."
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, if I may make a couple of comments. One is that there are a number of different bank regulators, as you know, and there may be differences among the regulators in terms of how aggressive they have been at trying to maintain this appropriate balance. I don't know. Speaking for the Federal Reserve, which oversees about 10 percent of community banks, we have made a very strenuous effort to try to achieve that appropriate balance. It is also possible, I mean, that the banks may be blaming examiners when, in fact, it is their own reluctance to lend which is really the problem. But I agree with the basic point that we need to do everything we can to make sure that banks make good loans, that if a creditworthy borrower comes, that they can get credit. With respect to your particular point, one of the specific elements of our guidance is that a decline in the value of the property, the commercial real estate is in itself not a reason not to make a loan if the cash-flow is adequate to make repayment. So we have been clear about that particular issue."
"Senator Menendez","Finally, I hear from the business community that they need certainty. Well, it seems to me they have certainty in the health field as a result of the law. They now have certainty in financial services regulations, or, I should say, the financial services, the Wall Street reform legislation. And I just want to make sure that my colleagues look at your testimony where you say that legislation represents significant progress toward reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and strengthening the capacity of financial regulators to respond to risks that may emerge, and you go on to say, I believe that the legislation, together with stronger regulatory standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past 3 years--the past 3 years. I think it is incredibly important to highlight that part of your testimony. Thank you for it. I thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Menendez. Let me, if I can, Judd Gregg, who I have a lot of respect for, raised the issue that uncertainty in fiscal policy was the, as he sees it, is one of the reasons for the lack of activity here. I am wondering if it is also--I mean, it seems to me that you are getting businesses with this low-growth capacity, where they are just--the demand isn't there. It seems to me that is as much of a factor here as anything else. I wonder if you might comment on that. Again, I am not trying to engage you into taking a side on this debate one way or the other. I think there is clearly some uncertainty out there, as you have described it. But it seems to me, as well, if people aren't--there isn't the capacity, the growth capacity, there is no demand. Therefore, people are not--the economy is not growing. How much of this can describe that?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Demand is certainly very important, absolutely. Firms have a lot of excess capacity. They are not making use of the factories and the buildings and the equipment they have now, and so that reduces their incentive to invest further."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, we have a lot of buildings that are just sitting idle, vacant."
"Mr. Bernanke","That is right."
"Chairman Dodd","So the utilization is--capacity utilization, there is no demand for it, it seems to me. That has an awful lot to--I just think that has to be added as a major factor in all of this. I gather you agree with that."
"Mr. Bernanke","Certainly the lack of demand, even the small businesses we were talking about, when they talk about what is their number one problem, it actually is not credit. It is lack of demand."
"Chairman Dodd","Let me jump, if I can--I did not get into this stuff. Several members raised questions with you about, in the financial reform bill, the role of the Federal Reserve. I wanted to raise the issue of the responsibility to impose that heightened capital liquidity and leverage standards on bank holding companies and designated nonbank financial companies, and obviously the harmonization issue, which we have talked about, is going to be critically important. But, in your view, will such standards need to be set significantly higher than they are at present in order to reduce the likelihood of another fiscal or financial crisis?"
"Mr. Bernanke","We are trying simultaneously to think about the small versus large bank or systemically critical versus noncritical bank capital issues. At the same time, we are looking with our colleagues internationally to try and establish relationships between capital standards across countries. So I do not think we really have come to a conclusion there. It is not a straightforward thing to answer that question, in part because large banks and small banks have such different portfolios and such different activities that they will have different capital levels even for the same set of rules. We are committed by the legislation and by our own approach, to requiring more capital of systemically critical firms, and in a progressive way as firms become even more critical, interconnected, essential to the functioning of the system that they need to both have higher capital and to be subject to tougher prudential regulation because of the effects they have on the whole system if they fail."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, let me ask you this, because there has been--we will get a lot of Monday morning quarterbacking on the bill, I presume for years to come. There was a proposal in one of the versions of the bill to actually set standards in the legislation. I opposed that idea because of the very answer you just gave to my question. And I am drawing the conclusion there that you think we did the right thing by not trying to set a specific standard in the legislation but allow for more nuanced response to it, again, based on the size of the institution we are talking about, the kind of risks they pose. On a related matter, the same question has been raised on we left a lot to the regulators, and, again, I am the first to admit exactly we did that, because, again, a set of proposed rules with commentary periods, all of the factors and processes we go through to determine how best to set these up. As someone who has been not only a student and a practitioner in all of this--and obviously a regulator, but aside from that, stepping back from the regulator role, was that generally the right approach in your view that we took with this matter rather than trying to write in a sense rigid standards in the legislation that would have, I think, been more constraining in terms of our ability to have a more measured response?"
"Mr. Bernanke","On the specifics of capital there are some rules, the Collins amendment and so on. But it was very important that we have at least some flexibility in order to negotiate and collaborate with our international colleagues on developing an international set of capital standards. So that was very important. Inevitably in a bill this complex that is addressing so many complex issues, if you want it to be responsive to changes in the environment, to deal with a lot of technical details, I think inevitably the regulators have to play a role. But Congress certainly has an oversight role. You are certainly going to be seeing what we do, and if you are dissatisfied, I am sure you will let us know."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, in fact, I want to do that, but I am not going to set the hearing date today, but I want to put my colleagues on notice here that my view would be that even as early as September--again, on the assumption we will be leaving here in October for the elections, but in September at some point--I will give people enough time, so probably toward the end of the month, conduct a series of hearings, either one or two of them anyway, with yourself and others to come before us and more specifically lay out what steps exactly are being taken by the various regulators under the proposed legislation so we get some sense of where things are heading at that time. That may be helpful. In that regard, I just wanted to ask you, the financial reform bill creates the Financial Stability and Oversight Council, which you know, and the Office of Financial Research to provide it with data and analysis on overall financial market conditions. And I think particularly, despite the criticism of some, I think the Office of Financial Research will be a real asset for us in terms of that kind of real-time data that ought to be, I hope, of real assistance to you and others. But do you think that the macroprudential supervision of the economy can help to prevent a financial crisis in the future? And how do you foresee--and this may be the more important of the two questions. How do you foresee the interaction of macroprudential supervision with the traditional bank-by-bank microprudential supervision of banking regulators?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, there has been some commentary which says that the bill relies too much on prescient or omnicompetent regulators to identify risks that are emerging. In fact, there are multiple aspects of this bill. First, there is the macroprudential aspect which asks the regulators to look for emerging risks."
"Chairman Dodd","Right."
"Mr. Bernanke","I think the regulators would have had a better chance of identifying some of the problems that arose in this recent crisis with that kind of framework that you have created. But beyond that macroprudential aspect, there is also a number of steps to strengthen the system, make it more resilient, to put more derivatives through central counterparties, to increase capital and so on, so that whatever the source of a future crisis, even if it is not identified and defused, the system will be better able to withstand that effect. And then, finally, if we get unfortunately to the firefighting stage, there are additional tools there. So I think it is a useful approach to have multiple ways of addressing crises, both preventive and resilience and firefighting. So the macroprudential part is very important. It is difficult. It is going to require coordination among different regulators, but it is a direction that regulators around the world and academics and others looking at this really believe is the right direction, and there is quite a bit of thinking already out there about how we could do, for example, stress tests that look at the whole system, which combine the results for individual firms, as you mentioned, but also are able to infer from that how the system as a whole might perform if a certain set of stresses arose. So there is clearly a relationship between the micro- and macroprudential part, but there is a lot of challenging work to be done there."
"Chairman Dodd","Well, I agree, and, again, you have already addressed this in passing, so I will leave it for a later gathering to look at all of this and how supervisory functions need to change under our legislation--I know you are giving a lot of thought to that already--as well as how we ought to handle the expanded mandates that we have saddled you with. And, again, I have a great deal of confidence it can be done, and I appreciate your response to Senator Bunning when he asked the question of whether or not you can do this. I am confident you can. Again, we have differences of opinions because I was looking at this a bit differently with more of a single prudential regulator where we sort of evolved from that back in November to what we have ended up here, and I accept that. That is how the process works here with people. I think even my views changed and were modified a bit as we went through the process. So I started out in one place. I would have been closer maybe to where I started out from than what we ended up, but, nonetheless, I accept the fact we are where we are and believe the capacity exists to get this right. And the fact that there is more of a holistic approach to this thing, where we have the capacity and the ability of talented people all driving toward the same goals, maintaining a strong, safe, and sound financial system with the kind of stability that is necessary in it, as well as restoring that level of trust and confidence in the system, which to me is the most critical element of all, that if the American people and others feel that sense of trust and confidence in our financial system, that in itself will have its own reward. So, again, I am very grateful to you and your staff and others for the tremendous amount of work you have put into this effort. I appreciate it very much. I look forward to getting together with you again in a couple of months here to really get down to the details of how this is going to work."
"Senator Shelby",""
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, some observers warn of growing risk in the $2.8 trillion municipal debt market. Parts of California as well as municipalities in Illinois, Michigan, and New York seem to have been vulnerable to market-driven widening of spreads on their bonds relative to Treasuries, especially when market anxiety over fiscal conditions in the euro zone grew. I have two questions regarding municipal debt. What is your assessment of the state of the U.S. municipal debt markets? Second, do you believe there is any merit to a recent characterization by Warren Buffett that there is potentially ``a terrible problem'' ahead for municipal bonds?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, first, it is certainly true that States and localities are under a lot of fiscal and financial stress. Their revenues have fallen considerably, and they are trying to maintain services and so on. So clearly we have seen some deficits and some cuts at the State and local level. My view is first of all that the municipal debt market is functioning pretty well, that at least States and localities that have good credit or seem to be sound are not having any difficulty accessing the municipal market, and that yields are pretty low, which is fortunate because there are a number of States and localities that are being forced to borrow under the current circumstances. Certainly there may be some localities in particular that will have trouble, but I would draw a distinction between say California and Greece, which is that because of these budget balance requirements, the outstanding debt of States is generally much less than the United States or other countries. So we always have to pay close attention, and there are a lot of stresses at the State and local level, but I do not at this point view the municipal debt market as being a major risk to the economy."
"Senator Shelby","Deflation and the Japanese experience, some people express fear that the U.S. could find itself in a period of deflation and, like Japan, have difficulty escaping. What do you believe are the differences between the U.S. and Japan in terms of structure of economic policy that would ensure that we do not follow the Japanese experience? And is that a concern of the Fed?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Again, forecasts are very uncertain, but I do not view deflation as a near-term risk for the United States. If you look at inflation expectations as measured by Government bond markets or by surveys, there has not really been much decline in expected inflation, and that stability of inflation expectations is one important factor that will keep inflation from falling very much. So, again, the forecasts of the FOMC are for a gradual increase of inflation toward a more normal, say 2-percent level, and there is not at this point, a very high probability that deflation will become a concern. I think there are very important differences between the U.S. and Japan. Some of them are structural. The Japanese economy has been relatively low productivity in recent years. It has got a declining labor force, and so its potential growth rate is lower than the U.S., and it has been a less vibrant economy in that respect. Also in Japan are much longer-lived problems with their banking system, which were not addressed for some years. For better or worse, we were very aggressive in addressing our banking system issues, and I think, as I mentioned to a couple of folks our system is strengthening and looks to be doing much better. So I do not think that will be a source of long-term drag either. And, finally, I would comment that I think the Federal reserve does have the capacity, the tools, should deflation occur--which I do not believe is very likely--to reverse it, and we would be assiduous in doing that. So I do not consider this to be a very high risk at this point, but, of course, we will continue to monitor the economy and the price level."
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Corker."
"Senator Corker","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for your testimony and coming here today. And I know there has been a lot of probings about monetary policy, and I very much appreciate the fact that you stayed consistent with your report. So I want to probe in another area, and that is, Senator Brown was pursuing the whole issue of China, and I do think that--and I know you said we should focus on the overall trade deficits, not the bilateral deficits. But I do think with the economy being as it is and just the relationship as it is, there may be attempts to try to deal with that legislatively. I do not know. And I just wondered if you would share with us the fact is--I mean, you did say it is a subsidy, and it is, to the Chinese people to have a currency valuation relative to the dollar that allows them to export to us. What are the things that all of us who want to make sure we try to do good things, what are the things we should think about as it relates to the Chinese currency? And what are some of the unintended consequences we should also be aware of?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Of the----"
"Senator Corker","Well, I mean, there are people looking at-- there are all kind of things, and I understand, especially folks who come from textile orientations and all of that. I know Chuck Schumer and Lindsey Graham have looked at some things. I think there is going to be a push. I just think as this economy moves along slowly and that trade gap widens, I think there may be some legislative efforts to deal with that. I am not saying I am going to be a part of that or not part of that, but what are the things that as legislators we should think about as it relates to that issue and some of the unintended consequences of dealing with it inappropriately?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I fully understand the concern, and again, it is felt more probably in specific industries than it is for the economy as a whole or for employment as a whole."
"Senator Corker","Say that again? I did not hear it."
"Mr. Bernanke","I understand the concern. I think that as Senator Brown was pointing out, it is easier to identify effects on specific industries than it is to find effects of the currency policy on the economy as a whole or unemployment as a whole, because there is not much relationship between our unemployment rate and our current account deficit. Just to take an obvious example, unemployment has soared recently while the current account deficit has actually come down. But I do understand the concern. All I can really say is that to take some of the steps that have been suggested would be quite severe steps and would cause considerable concern about our overall relationship with China and other countries and about our trading policies. Again, I understand the concern, but I would just reiterate first that this is a complex problem and that it is not just the currency that is involved. The Chinese are also involved in trying to restructure their economy to become more reliant on domestic demand, first of all. Second, I would note that the United States has got a vibrant bilateral relationship in terms of our dialog, for example, the strategic and economic dialog which has been going on was created by Secretary Paulson, has been expanded and continued by the current administration. And one of the things that is evident from that is that the U.S. and China have a wide range of issues, not just the currency but a wide range of issues relating to energy and environment and tourism and investment and trade and many other things where we have common interests, where we need to work cooperatively together. So I hope that Congress will think very carefully before taking any strong action. At the same time, I recognize that particularly the Treasury has a special role here because they are the spokesman for the currency, but for the Federal Reserve as well to try to maintain a constant dialogue to persuade the Chinese and to apply pressure to them that they need to adjust their currency, which is their current policy distorts capital flows globally, but it is not even good for China in the longer term. It distorts their economy as well and makes them too reliant on exports and reduces their own domestic consumption and also makes their monetary policy less independent. So there are a lot of costs to them as well, and we are hopeful that they have become more appreciative of those concerns over time."
"Senator Corker","In most recent statements that they made, they gave a tilt, if you will, prior to some G-20 meetings, as to what they may be doing. What do you read into that? And what is your sense as you talk to counterparts about what their longer-term efforts will be?"
"Mr. Bernanke","With respect to the currency?"
"Senator Corker","Yes."
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, as you know, they have gone back to the managed float which allows for small changes in the currency. I think that the amount that they let it move will depend on their own views of the stability of their own economy and global growth. We are going to have to see. I honestly do not know exactly what their plans are. I suspect that they will be responding to how they view the evolution of global economic conditions."
"Senator Corker","Well, Mr. Chairman, I thank you for coming and certainly look forward to talking to you about those issues going down the road. We had a good hearing yesterday that Senator Bayh chaired, and I think in any bill that passes there are good things and bad things, and people have to make decisions about how they voted based on the net effect. I do think that all of us are hopeful that as it relates to our relations with the other countries, we end up with a regulatory regime that works well for all of us, and I wish you well in those efforts and look forward to talking to you as you move ahead. Thank you."
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you, Senator."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you Let me ask, Mr. Chairman--and, again, this goes to the same sort of question that Senator Corker has raised. Some have suggested that we would have been better off had we not acted in this area of financial reform, that if we had just let the market continue the status quo. In fact, some have even suggested that given the opportunity they would like to repeal this effort we have all gone through over the last year and a half. Assuming that what you are talking about is repealed is basically going back to the status quo, are we better off, in your view, with this legislation--I know a lot of work needs to be done--than we would be if we would have just maintained the status quo as things were prior to the passage of this legislation?"
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes, I think we are. I think there were important gaps in our regulatory system which became painfully evident during the crisis and that substantial progress has been made to closing those gaps. We have increased our capacity to take a macroprudential approach, which I think is an important complement to our current institution-by-institution approach. And the ability to wind down large firms and avoid the bailout problem or avoid the situation where we have to choose between a bailout and a financial crisis, I think that is an important step also. Now, all those things are going to require a lot of work to make them effective and useful tools, but it was very important to address those problems."
"Chairman Dodd","And so, therefore, it would be imprudent to repeal what we have talked about, what we have done here?"
"Mr. Bernanke","No, I would not support repeal."
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. This Committee will stand adjourned. Thank you, Mr. Chairman."
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you.   "
"PREPARED STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE"," Chairman, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System July 21, 2010  Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. Economic and Financial Developments The economic expansion that began in the middle of last year is proceeding at a moderate pace, supported by stimulative monetary and fiscal policies. Although fiscal policy and inventory restocking will likely be providing less impetus to the recovery than they have in recent quarters, rising demand from households and businesses should help sustain growth. In particular, real consumer spending appears to have expanded at about a 2\1/2\ percent annual rate in the first half of this year, with purchases of durable goods increasing especially rapidly. However, the housing market remains weak, with the overhang of vacant or foreclosed houses weighing on home prices and construction. An important drag on household spending is the slow recovery in the labor market and the attendant uncertainty about job prospects. After 2 years of job losses, private payrolls expanded at an average of about 100,000 per month during the first half of this year, a pace insufficient to reduce the unemployment rate materially. In all likelihood, a significant amount of time will be required to restore the nearly 8\1/2\ million jobs that were lost over 2008 and 2009. Moreover, nearly half of the unemployed have been out of work for longer than 6 months. Long-term unemployment not only imposes exceptional near-term hardships on workers and their families, it also erodes skills and may have long-lasting effects on workers' employment and earnings prospects. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software appears to have increased rapidly in the first half of the year, in part reflecting capital outlays that had been deferred during the downturn and the need of many businesses to replace aging equipment. In contrast, spending on nonresidential structures--weighed down by high vacancy rates and tight credit--has continued to contract, though some indicators suggest that the rate of decline may be slowing. Both U.S. exports and U.S. imports have been expanding, reflecting growth in the global economy and the recovery of world trade. Stronger exports have in turn helped foster growth in the U.S. manufacturing sector. Inflation has remained low. The price index for personal consumption expenditures appears to have risen at an annual rate of less than 1 percent in the first half of the year. Although overall inflation has fluctuated, partly reflecting changes in energy prices, by a number of measures underlying inflation has trended down over the past 2 years. The slack in labor and product markets has damped wage and price pressures, and rapid increases in productivity have further reduced producers' unit labor costs. My colleagues on the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) and I expect continued moderate growth, a gradual decline in the unemployment rate, and subdued inflation over the next several years. In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared forecasts of economic growth, unemployment, and inflation for the years 2010 through 2012 and over the longer run. The forecasts are qualitatively similar to those we released in February and May, although progress in reducing unemployment is now expected to be somewhat slower than we previously projected, and near-term inflation now looks likely to be a little lower. Most FOMC participants expect real GDP growth of 3 to 3\1/2\ percent in 2010, and roughly 3\1/2\ to 4\1/2\ percent in 2011 and 2012. The unemployment rate is expected to decline to between 7 and 7\1/2\ percent by the end of 2012. Most participants viewed uncertainty about the outlook for growth and unemployment as greater than normal, and the majority saw the risks to growth as weighted to the downside. Most participants projected that inflation will average only about 1 percent in 2010 and that it will remain low during 2011 and 2012, with the risks to the inflation outlook roughly balanced. One factor underlying the Committee's somewhat weaker outlook is that financial conditions--though much improved since the depth of the financial crisis--have become less supportive of economic growth in recent months. Notably, concerns about the ability of Greece and a number of other euro-area countries to manage their sizable budget deficits and high levels of public debt spurred a broad-based withdrawal from risk-taking in global financial markets in the spring, resulting in lower stock prices and wider risk spreads in the United States. In response to these fiscal pressures, European leaders put in place a number of strong measures, including an assistance package for Greece and =500 billion of funding to backstop the near-term financing needs of euro-area countries. To help ease strains in U.S. dollar funding markets, the Federal Reserve reestablished temporary dollar liquidity swap lines with the ECB and several other major central banks. To date, drawings under the swap lines have been limited, but we believe that the existence of these lines has increased confidence in dollar funding markets, helping to maintain credit availability in our own financial system. Like financial conditions generally, the state of the U.S. banking system has also improved significantly since the worst of the crisis. Loss rates on most types of loans seem to be peaking, and, in the aggregate, bank capital ratios have risen to new highs. However, many banks continue to have a large volume of troubled loans on their books, and bank lending standards remain tight. With credit demand weak and with banks writing down problem credits, bank loans outstanding have continued to contract. Small businesses, which depend importantly on bank credit, have been particularly hard hit. At the Federal Reserve, we have been working to facilitate the flow of funds to creditworthy small businesses. Along with the other supervisory agencies, we issued guidance to banks and examiners emphasizing that lenders should do all they can to meet the needs of creditworthy borrowers, including small businesses. \1\ We also have conducted extensive training programs for our bank examiners, with the message that lending to viable small businesses is good for the safety and soundness of our banking system as well as for our economy. We continue to seek feedback from both banks and potential borrowers about credit conditions. For example, over the past 6 months we have convened more than 40 meetings around the country of lenders, small business representatives, bank examiners, government officials, and other stakeholders to exchange ideas about the challenges faced by small businesses, particularly in obtaining credit. A capstone conference on addressing the credit needs of small businesses was held at the Board of Governors in Washington last week. \2\ This testimony includes an addendum that summarizes the findings of this effort and possible next steps.  \1\ See Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, National Credit Union Administration, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Office of Thrift Supervision, and Conference of State Bank Supervisors (2010), ``Regulators Issue Statement on Lending to Creditworthy Small Businesses'', joint press release, February 5, www.federalreserve.gov/ newsevents/press/bcreg/20100205a.htm. \2\ For more information, see Ben S. Bernanke (2010), ``Restoring the Flow of Credit to Small Businesses'', speech delivered at ``Addressing the Financing Needs of Small Businesses,'' a forum sponsored by the Federal Reserve Board, Washington, July 12, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/speech/bernanke20100712a.htm.  Federal Reserve Policy The Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and the recession has involved several components. First, in response to the periods of intense illiquidity and dysfunction in financial markets that characterized the crisis, the Federal Reserve undertook a range of measures and set up emergency programs designed to provide liquidity to financial institutions and markets in the form of fully secured, mostly short-term loans. Over time, these programs helped to stem the panic and to restore normal functioning in a number of key financial markets, supporting the flow of credit to the economy. As financial markets stabilized, the Federal Reserve shut down most of these programs during the first half of this year and took steps to normalize the terms on which it lends to depository institutions. The only such programs currently open to provide new liquidity are the recently reestablished dollar liquidity swap lines with major central banks that I noted earlier. Importantly, our broad-based programs achieved their intended purposes with no loss to taxpayers. All of the loans extended through the multiborrower facilities that have come due have been repaid in full, with interest. In addition, the Board does not expect the Federal Reserve to incur a net loss on any of the secured loans provided during the crisis to help prevent the disorderly failure of systemically significant financial institutions. A second major component of the Federal Reserve's response to the financial crisis and recession has involved both standard and less conventional forms of monetary policy. Over the course of the crisis, the FOMC aggressively reduced its target for the Federal funds rate to a range of 0 to \1/4\ percent, which has been maintained since the end of 2008. And, as indicated in the statement released after the June meeting, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions-- including low rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations--are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the federal funds rate for an extended period. \3\  \3\ See, Federal Reserve Board of Governors (2010), ``FOMC Statement'', press release, June 23, www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/ press/monetary/20100623a.htm.  In addition to the very low Federal funds rate, the FOMC has provided monetary policy stimulus through large-scale purchases of longer-term Treasury debt, Federal agency debt, and agency mortgage- backed securities (MBS). A range of evidence suggests that these purchases helped improve conditions in mortgage markets and other private credit markets and put downward pressure on longer-term private borrowing rates and spreads. Compared with the period just before the financial crisis, the System's portfolio of domestic securities has increased from about $800 billion to $2 trillion and has shifted from consisting of 100 percent Treasury securities to having almost two-thirds of its investments in agency-related securities. In addition, the average maturity of the Treasury portfolio nearly doubled, from 3\1/2\ years to almost 7 years. The FOMC plans to return the System's portfolio to a more normal size and composition over the longer term, and the Committee has been discussing alternative approaches to accomplish that objective. One approach is for the Committee to adjust its reinvestment policy--that is, its policy for handling repayments of principal on the securities--to gradually normalize the portfolio over time. Currently, repayments of principal from agency debt and MBS are not being reinvested, allowing the holdings of those securities to run off as the repayments are received. By contrast, the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities are being reinvested in new issues of Treasury securities with similar maturities. At some point, the Committee may want to shift its reinvestment of the proceeds from maturing Treasury securities to shorter-term issues, so as to gradually reduce the average maturity of our Treasury holdings toward precrisis levels, while leaving the aggregate value of those holdings unchanged. At this juncture, however, no decision to change reinvestment policy has been made. A second way to normalize the size and composition of the Federal Reserve's securities portfolio would be to sell some holdings of agency debt and MBS. Selling agency securities, rather than simply letting them run off, would shrink the portfolio and return it to a composition of all Treasury securities more quickly. FOMC participants broadly agree that sales of agency-related securities should eventually be used as part of the strategy to normalize the portfolio. Such sales will be implemented in accordance with a framework communicated well in advance and will be conducted at a gradual pace. Because changes in the size and composition of the portfolio could affect financial conditions, however, any decisions regarding the commencement or pace of asset sales will be made in light of the Committee's evaluation of the outlook for employment and inflation. As I noted earlier, the FOMC continues to anticipate that economic conditions are likely to warrant exceptionally low levels of the Federal funds rate for an extended period. At some point, however, the Committee will need to begin to remove monetary policy accommodation to prevent the buildup of inflationary pressures. When that time comes, the Federal Reserve will act to increase short-term interest rates by raising the interest rate it pays on reserve balances that depository institutions hold at Federal Reserve Banks. To tighten the linkage between the interest rate paid on reserves and other short-term market interest rates, the Federal Reserve may also drain reserves from the banking system. Two tools for draining reserves from the system are being developed and tested and will be ready when needed. First, the Federal Reserve is putting in place the capacity to conduct large reverse repurchase agreements with an expanded set of counterparties. Second, the Federal Reserve has tested a term deposit facility, under which instruments similar to the certificates of deposit that banks offer their customers will be auctioned to depository institutions. Of course, even as the Federal Reserve continues prudent planning for the ultimate withdrawal of extraordinary monetary policy accommodation, we also recognize that the economic outlook remains unusually uncertain. We will continue to carefully assess ongoing financial and economic developments, and we remain prepared to take further policy actions as needed to foster a return to full utilization of our Nation's productive potential in a context of price stability. Financial Reform Legislation Last week, the Congress passed landmark legislation to reform the financial system and financial regulation, and the President signed the bill into law this morning. That legislation represents significant progress toward reducing the likelihood of future financial crises and strengthening the capacity of financial regulators to respond to risks that may emerge. Importantly, the legislation encourages an approach to supervision designed to foster the stability of the financial system as a whole as well as the safety and soundness of individual institutions. Within the Federal Reserve, we have already taken steps to strengthen our analysis and supervision of the financial system and systemically important financial firms in ways consistent with the new legislation. In particular, making full use of the Federal Reserve's broad expertise in economics, financial markets, payment systems, and bank supervision, we have significantly changed our supervisory framework to improve our consolidated supervision of large, complex bank holding companies, and we are enhancing the tools we use to monitor the financial sector and to identify potential systemic risks. In addition, the briefings prepared for meetings of the FOMC are now providing increased coverage and analysis of potential risks to the financial system, thus supporting the Federal Reserve's ability to make effective monetary policy and to enhance financial stability. Much work remains to be done, both to implement through regulation the extensive provisions of the new legislation and to develop the macroprudential approach called for by the Congress. However, I believe that the legislation, together with stronger regulatory standards for bank capital and liquidity now being developed, will place our financial system on a sounder foundation and minimize the risk of a repetition of the devastating events of the past 3 years. Thank you. I would be pleased to respond to your questions. "

"RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SCHUMER FROM BEN S. BERNANKE","  Q.1. Effect of Stimulus--The economy has been growing for several quarters now, but that growth has been significantly boosted by tax cuts and government spending under the Recovery Act. Economists think the boost was as much as 2\1/2\ percentage points and the Council of Economic Advisors last week estimated that Recovery Act programs created and saved 2.5 to 3.6 million jobs. It's always hard to speculate on counterfactual scenarios, but how much do you think the Recovery Act programs--tax cuts and spending--have boosted GDP growth so far? What do you think the state of our economy, including the unemployment rate, would be right now if we hadn't passed the stimulus bill?  A.1. As noted by your question, it is difficult to confidently determine the effects of the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act (ARRA) on economic activity. In particular, it is not possible to establish with certainty the counterfactual of what households and State and local governments would have spent in the absence of receiving stimulus funds. That said, the available economic evidence suggests that the tax reductions and increases in transfers for households have likely provided support to consumer spending--relative to what it would have been otherwise--as households, since the enactment of the ARRA, have faced sluggish income growth, an extremely weak labor market, losses in wealth, and tight credit conditions. Also, the stimulus grants for states and localities appear to have helped these governments maintain their spending--relative to what it would have been otherwise--in the face of very weak tax receipts. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has provided what I think is a reasonable range of estimates of the effects of the ARRA on macroeconomic activity. The CBO's estimates suggest that the ARRA boosted the rate of change in real GDP by between 1\1/2\ and 3\1/2\ percentage points last year and added around \1/4\ to 1 percentage point to real GDP growth in the first half of this year; the unemployment rate is estimated to have been reduced by between \3/4\ and 2 percentage points by the middle of this year. The fiscal policy actions taken to address the extraordinary challenges imposed by the recent recession and the financial crisis have contributed to significantly wider Federal deficits since last year. These actions were necessary to help mitigate the overall loss of employment and income that otherwise would have occurred thereby laying the groundwork for a self-sustaining, broad-based recovery. But maintaining the confidence of the financial markets and the public requires that plans now begin to be put into place for the restoration of fiscal balance in the medium term in order to avoid the economic costs and risks associated with persistently large deficits that cause the Federal debt to expand significantly faster than the economy.   "
"RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BROWN FROM BEN S. BERNANKE","  Q.1. Back in December 2006, during the U.S.-China Strategic dialogue, you described China's undervalued currency as ``an effective subsidy for Chinese exporters.'' During your testimony you confirmed that you believe this to still be the case. Do you agree with many economists that the subsidy approaches 40 percent? If not, what is the price subsidy range, and what evidence are you using to support this conclusion?  A.1. This note briefly summarizes the professional literature that seeks to assess the undervaluation of the Chinese renminbi (RMB). While this literature has generated an array of estimates, most studies put the extent of this undervaluation in the range of roughly 10 percent to 30 percent. For many reasons, when discussing currency misalignments and their implications for current account balances, economists generally prefer to focus on the behavior of the real effective exchange rate (which takes into account the value of a country's currency against the currencies of all of its trading partners and adjusts for cross-country differences in rates of inflation) rather than on bilateral nominal exchange rates. The estimates reported here, therefore, focus on the extent of undervaluation of the real effective Chinese exchange rate, rather than of the nominal value of the RMB vis-a-vis the dollar. There is no single accepted methodology for determining whether a country's exchange rate is appropriately valued. Studies have employed a variety of approaches to measure a currency's misalignment, including the following:  <bullet>  One approach seeks to estimate how far the real effective exchange rate is from the level that would ensure a sustainable current account balance over the medium term.  <bullet>  Another approach aims to estimate how out of line a country's real effective exchange rate is compared with those of other countries, taking into account the country's level of development, income, and other macroeconomic and financial considerations.  <bullet>  Yet a third approach attempts to gauge how far a country's real effective exchange rate is from the level that would be necessary to stabilize the country's net creditor position at a reasonable level relative to the size of its GDP.  Using these approaches, researchers have found a wide range of estimates for the extent of undervaluation of the Chinese RMB. There are some outlier estimates that put the Chinese currency at being even 5 percent overvalued and, at the other extreme, at as much as 60 percent undervalued. The bulk of the studies, however, fall in the range of 10 percent to 30 percent, undervaluation. For example, a very recent study, Cline and Williamson (2010), follows the first approach described above and obtains the result that the RMB is approximately 15 percent undervalued. \1\ Cline and Williamson arrive at this result by assuming China's sustainable (or ``target'') current account surplus to be about 3 percent of GDP and using a forecasted value of the current account surplus in the absence of any exchange rate adjustment of about 7.5 percent of GDP. \2\ They then estimate that the amount of real effective appreciation of the RMB that would be necessary to move the current account from 7.5 percent of GDP to 3 percent of GDP is about 15 percent. \3\  \1\ William R. Cline and John Williamson, ``Estimates of Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rates, May 2010'', Peterson Institute for International Economics, Policy Brief Number PB10-15. \2\ They take the forecasted value of China's current account from the International Monetary Fund's World Economic Outlook, April 2010 with some adjustments. \3\ Last year, when the IMF was forecasting a bigger medium-term current account surplus for China, Cline and Williamson's estimate of the degree of undervaluation of the real effective RMB was a little over 20 percent.  Another study, Goldstein (2007), finds that ``the RMB is now grossly undervalued--on the order of 30 percent or more against an average of China's trading partners.'' \4\ However, this finding uses data that go only through 2006. Generally, estimates using more recent data find a somewhat smaller degree of undervaluation. The IMF staff has also determined that the ``renminbi remains substantially below the level that is consistent with medium-term fundamentals.'' \5\ Clearly, these estimates and other estimates in this literature are quite sensitive to a number of underlying assumptions about which there is often not much consensus, as well as to the approaches used to compute the undervaluation and the exact vintage of Chinese data used in the analysis.  \4\ Morris Goldstein, ``A (Lack of) Progress Report on China's Exchange Rate Policies'', Peterson Institute for International Economics, Working Paper 07-5.

"RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR DEMINT FROM BEN S. BERNANKE","  Q.1. In the past months, the European Central Bank has spent billions of dollars to purchase sovereign debt from overleveraged EU countries, in essence bailing out these countries by supporting their ability to continue to finance further debt rather than impose needed budgetary discipline. Prior to this program, the ECB, through liquidity facilities, was accepting sovereign debt collateral from European banks. Here at home in the U.S., some States and municipalities have similarly overleveraged themselves and failed to make the difficult decisions necessary to get their finances in order-- the clearest example being the States of Illinois and California. Being concerned that the Federal Reserve could choose to pursue a similar course, is it your opinion that the Fed has the authority:  a. To accept municipal debt as collateral from commercial or investment banks?  b. To create a special lending facility for private-sector purchases of municipal bonds, similar to what the Fed did in 2009 for commercial real estate securitizations?  c. To guarantee or directly purchase municipal bonds in the secondary market, similar to the purchase program for the more than $1 trillion of mortgage-backed securities now on the Fed's balance sheet?  d. To lend directly to overleveraged States or municipalities?  A.1. Answer not received by time of publication.  Q.2. If your answer to any of Question Number 1's subparts is yes, please explain, for each and with specific references, from where this authority is derived?  A.2. Answer not received by time of publication.  Q.3. Would you ever support any of the following courses of action for the Federal Reserve:  a. To accept municipal debt as collateral from commercial or investment banks?  b. To create a special lending facility for private-sector purchases of municipal bonds, similar to what the Fed did in 2009 for commercial real estate securitizations?  c.

"RESPONSES TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR VITTER FROM BEN S. BERNANKE","  Q.1. Chairman Bernanke, I am deeply disturbed by the most recent quarterly report to Congress from the Special Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program. In this report, SIGTARP Neil Barofsky tells Congress that reductions in current outstanding balances of TARP and TARP-related programs ``have been more than offset in the past 12 months by significant increases in expenditures and guarantees in other programs, with the total current outstanding balance increasing 23 percent, from approximately $3.0 trillion to $3.7 trillion. This increase can largely be attributed to great support for the Government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), the housing market, and the financial institutions that participate in it'' despite the fact that the banking crisis, by an reasonable measures, subsided. How long do you perceive a need for extraordinary taxpayer support for the housing market?  A.1. As your question suggests, declining balances in, and closing of, some financial-sector support programs are positive developments that are indicative of a gradual healing in the financial system. The stock of other assets acquired by the Federal Government related to extraordinary support of the financial system has increased significantly over the past year, including purchases of Treasury, agency, and agency- guaranteed mortgage-backed securities under the Federal Reserve's large scale asset purchase program, and purchases by Treasury of preferred shares in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as those GSEs continue to operate in conservatorship. Other housing-related guarantees, commitments, and outlays by the Government have also grown significantly over that period, although some are probably better understood as reflecting extraordinary conditions in the housing finance market more than extraordinary actions to support the financial system. In particular, mortgage loans and mortgage-backed securities guaranteed by FRA and the GSEs have continued to rise substantially, as the private-label mortgage securitization market remained essentially closed. The programs described above, along with continuing low mortgage interest rates and the effects of the first-time homebuyer tax credit, have helped support housing market conditions and thus to blunt some of the damage of the financial crisis. Nonetheless underlying weaknesses remain in the housing and home finance markets. As noted in my testimony, for example, housing construction has continued to be weighed down by weak demand, a large inventory of distressed or vacant houses, and tight credit conditions for builders and some potential buyers. For their part, RAMP and non-RAMP foreclosure mitigation loan modification programs have made a positive contribution, reducing debt service obligations for many struggling borrowers. Over the longer horizon, it remains too early to assess the overall effect of these programs, including the extent to which borrowers with RAMP permanent modifications, or other loan modifications and refinancings, may subsequently default on these obligations. As economic and financial conditions gradually improve, the extraordinary conditions and need for extraordinary Government actions will of course diminish. When that time comes, as with the Federal Reserve's purchases of agency-guaranteed mortgage- backed securities, the withdrawal of extraordinary support should be managed carefully so that it can be achieved with a minimum of associated dislocation. Congress has a direct/public policy role to play in some aspects of this eventual withdrawal, including as it considers the future role of Government-sponsored enterprises in the market for housing finance. The non-TARP program estimates published in SIGTARP reports are assembled directly by SIGTARP staff across non-TARP programs they deem relevant, drawn from public sources. Without speaking directly to the figures you reference, the SIGTARP estimates cited in your question can reasonably be interpreted as consistent with this assessment.  Q.2. Chairman Bernanke, you have indicated that the Federal Reserve may undertake additional asset purchases. What kind of assets will the Fed purchase if it decides to undertake a second quantitative easing? How will you ensure that the Federal Reserve adequately protects itself in pricing those asset purchases and how long would the Fed hold those assets on its balance sheet? What metric will you use to determine that additional easing is necessary?  A.2. Consistent with its statutory mandate to foster maximum employment and stable prices, the Federal Reserve would consider additional steps to provide monetary accommodation if economic developments suggested that it was appropriate to do so. As noted in the minutes of recent FOMC meetings and in speeches by Federal Reserve officials, purchasing additional assets would be one of the options that the Federal Reserve could implement in such a situation. The Federal Reserve's legal authority largely limits Federal Reserve purchases of securities to Treasury, agency, and agency-guaranteed securities. As a result, additional Federal Reserve purchases of securities, if deemed necessary, would likely be of these general types. Decisions about the specific securities that would be purchased within this general class of securities would depend on a number of factors, including the implications of purchases for the general level of longer-term interest rates, the effect of purchases on market liquidity and functioning, and policymakers' preferences for the long-run composition of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet. As in the past, the Federal Reserve would employ a competitive bidding process in purchasing securities to ensure that such purchases are conducted at market prices. The evidence suggests that the Fed's earlier program of purchases of securities was effective in improving market functioning and lowering long-term interest rates in a number of private credit markets. The program (which was significantly expanded in March 2009) made an important contribution to the economic stabilization and recovery that began in the spring of 2009. Indeed, the FOMC's recent decision to keep constant the Federal Reserve's securities holdings reflects the conviction that these holdings can promote financial conditions that help support the recovery. Decisions regarding how long these assets or any newly acquired assets will be held on the Federal Reserve's balance sheet will be based on an assessment of the outlook for economic activity and inflation. There are no simple metrics that the Federal Reserve can employ in determining whether additional policy easing is necessary and, if so, whether additional purchases of securities would be appropriate. As always, a wide range of economic indicators informs the Federal Reserve's view about the outlook for economic activity and inflation. Any decision to acquire additional securities would need to weigh the potential benefits of such purchases against the potential costs. Regarding potential benefits, additional purchases could further lower the costs of borrowing for households and businesses and thereby provide needed support for spending and economic growth. On the other hand, further purchases of securities could reduce public confidence in the ability of the Federal Reserve to exit smoothly from a very accommodative policy stance at the appropriate time. Even if unjustified, a reduction in confidence might lead to an undesired increase in inflation expectations and so to upward pressure on actual inflation. The Federal Reserve will weigh these and other considerations and carefully monitor economic and financial developments in judging whether additional asset purchases are warranted.  Q.3. A number of economists, market watchers and Members of Congress have speculated that U.S. firms are reluctant to invest and hire, though they may have the cash on their balance sheets to do so, because of uncertainty over a dramatic reshaping of the health care and financial regulatory regimes. How large of a role do you believe this uncertainty is playing in companies' decisions on how and when to deploy their capital? And, do you think the uncertainty over future tax rates also factors in?  A.3. Several factors are likely to influence hiring and capital spending decisions. Typically, a firm's sales prospects and the expected rate of return to an investment--either in new equipment or new workers--are key elements in the decision. In some cases, access to credit also might affect decisions to invest and hire. In addition, uncertainty about the economic environment or expected returns can also influence the willingness of a firm to make spending commitments. Recent surveys of businesses provide some insights into these issues and suggest that many firms are concerned about the overall economic environment and their company's own sales prospects. Two examples are presented in the table. As shown on line 1, 36 percent of respondents to the latest Duke CFO survey cited consumer demand as the most important problem facing their business. Fortunately, concerns about consumer demand have diminished from a year ago, but they remain the most frequently cited problem. Similarly, as shown on line 3 of the table, respondents to the latest survey of small businesses, conducted by the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), pointed to poor sales as their most important problem, but that concern also has diminished from a year ago. In addition, the S&P 500 volatility index (VIX), an indicator of uncertainty in financial markets, also is down from its previous peaks, although it remains relatively elevated by historical standards."
"<GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT>","  It is difficult to know the extent to which uncertainty specifically related to future taxes, the recently enacted health care legislation, or financial regulatory reform is affecting business capital spending and hiring decisions. However, both the Duke CFO survey and the NFIB allow respondents to cite government policies more generally as the most important problem facing their business. These responses are shown on lines 2 and 4 of the table. In addition, line 5 presents the data on the extent to which taxes are a pressing business concern. Of course, these responses are not direct indicators of uncertainty. Moreover, the figures presented in the table are from only two surveys and may not present a complete picture of whether greater uncertainty about Government policies is restraining capital spending and hiring.  Q.4. Are you concerned that keeping interest rates this low, for such an extended period of time, will have negative or dangerous consequences? Why, or why not?  A.4. The FOMC has established a very low level of short-term interest rates to foster its statutory objectives of maximum employment and stable prices. The FOMC has been very explicit in stating that the current very accommodative stance of monetary policy is conditional on the economic outlook, which includes low anticipated rates of resource utilization, subdued inflation trends, and stable inflation expectations. The explicit conditionality of the Federal Reserve's policy stance should help to guard against adverse outcomes such as a buildup in inflationary pressures or imbalances in financial markets. As the economy recovers, investors, seeing that the conditions supporting the current stance of policy have changed, will likely begin to anticipate the removal of policy accommodation; such anticipations of policy firming will, in turn, boost longer-term interest rates immediately, helping to damp any buildup in inflationary pressures. Of course, the Federal Reserve must be able to validate expectations of policy firming at the appropriate time. To do so, the Federal Reserve has a number of tools at its disposal. First, the Federal Reserve will put upward pressure on short-term interest rates by raising the rate it pays on the reserve balances held by depository institutions. Second, the Federal Reserve has developed reserve draining tools that can be employed to reduce the quantities of reserves outstanding and thereby tighten the relationship between the rate paid on reserve balances and short-term market rates. Finally, the Federal Reserve can sell assets at an appropriate time and pace to further tighten the stance of monetary policy. In short, the Federal Reserve has the tools necessary to effectively remove policy accommodation when such actions are warranted by the economic outlook. As always, the Federal Reserve is sensitive to the risks surrounding the outlook, and we are mindful of the possibility that very low interest rates could, if maintained for too long, lead to adverse economic outcomes. At the same time, there are risks that the premature removal of policy accommodation could undermine the economic recovery and contribute to unwelcome disinflationary pressures. The Federal Reserve will be monitoring economic and financial developments carefully to ensure that its policy actions appropriately balance these risks.   "
"RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR HUTCHISON FROM BEN S. BERNANKE","  Q.1. During initial Senate consideration of financial regulatory reform legislation, I was very concerned that State- chartered community banks and small-and medium-sized bank holding companies would no longer be able to choose supervision from the Federal Reserve. I worried that community banks in Texas and across the country would lose access to the Federal Reserve, and, likewise, that the Fed would lose the important data that these important financial institutions provide on economic and banking conditions in communities in Texas and across the country. I was proud to sponsor Amendment 3759 during Senate consideration to ensure that State-chartered banks and small- and medium-sized bank holding companies could retain Federal Reserve supervision. I appreciate the support that you and many of the regional Federal Reserve presidents demonstrated to help my amendment pass with overwhelming support; I worked hard to ensure that community banks would not be unduly penalized as a result of the new regulations which will come from the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. However, I continue to hear from many Texas community bankers sharing concerns about the possible effects of this legislation. The regulatory burden on community banks, particularly small banks in rural locations, was already significant prior to the enactment of legislation. Many in the Texas banking community fear that the rules soon to be written by the new Consumer Financial Protection Agency will be the tipping point for many community banks, making the regulatory burden too great to operate effectively. Texas community bankers are concerned that greater regulation will ultimately lead smaller community banks to succumb to larger banks, which would make the big bigger and wipe out the smaller banks. As a Member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs having oversight over the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, I respectfully ask the following: Which provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act require careful monitoring from the Committee because their respective implementation could be especially burdensome to community banks?  A.1. Although adjustments were made to moderate the impact of the Collins amendment, the effect of this provision (section 171) on the ability of smaller banking organizations to access capital from the public markets warrants close monitoring. You are correct that the impact on community banks of various portions of the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the Title VII derivatives provisions and the Title X Consumer Financial Protection Bureau provisions, will depend in part on the regulatory implementation of those provisions. As I mentioned often during the debate, small community banks play a key role in our financial system. Close connections with community bankers enable the Federal Reserve to better understand the full range of financial concerns and risks facing the country. The community banking perspective is also critical as we assess the burden and effectiveness of financial regulation.  Q.2. What proposals do you have to help our Nation's community banks withstand the onslaught of new regulations so that they can remain competitive and avoid potential arbitrage in the future by larger banks?  A.2. Through implementation of provisions addressing the ``too- big-to-fail'' problem, the Dodd-Frank Act should help to level the playing field between small and large banks. The Federal Reserve supported such provisions--including implementation of a resolution regime for large, interconnected firms and the imposition of more rigorous capital, liquidity, and supervisory requirements for large systemically important banking firms and nonbank financial institutions--in part because of the disparate treatment that resulted for banks of different sizes. Under the new law, the competitive position of community banks may be improved as implicit ``too-big-to-fail'' subsidies from which the largest banks previously benefited are removed through the higher supervisory costs and requirements placed on institutions that are or become large and systemically important.
