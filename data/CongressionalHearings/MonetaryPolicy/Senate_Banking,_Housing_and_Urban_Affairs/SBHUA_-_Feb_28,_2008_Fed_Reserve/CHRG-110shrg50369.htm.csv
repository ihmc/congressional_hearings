"Chairman Dodd","The Committee will come to order. I am pleased to call the Committee to order this morning. Today, the Committee will hear the testimony of Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on the outlook of the Nation's economy, the Fed's conduct of monetary policy, and the status of important consumer protection regulations that are under the Fed's jurisdiction. This is Chairman Bernanke's second appearance before the Committee this year. Mr. Chairman, it is good to have you with us, and, again, it is 2 weeks ago and now again today here. You are becoming a regular here, and so we appreciate your appearance before the Committee. When Chairman Bernanke was first before the Committee 2 weeks ago, I laid out the facts of what I consider to be our Nation's very serious, if not perilous, economic condition. Growth is slowing, inflation is rising, consumer confidence is plummeting, while indebtedness is deepening. And just as ominously, the credit markets have experienced significant disruptions. Consumers are unable or unwilling to borrow. Lenders are unable or unwilling to lend. There is a palpable sense of uncertainty and even fear in the markets with a crisis of confidence that has spread beyond the mortgage markets to markets in student loans. And I noted this morning--by the way, 2 weeks ago I pointed out that Michigan was indicating some serious problems with student lending, and this morning I am reading where Pennsylvania today--you may have seen the article--may decide to also curtail student loans as a result of this growing economic situation. We have also seen the problem with credit cards, government bonds, and corporate finance. Unfortunately, the crisis of confidence does not just exist by American consumers and lenders. It increasingly appears that there is a crisis of confidence among the rest of the world in the United States economy. Yesterday, the dollar reached its lowest level since 1973, when the dollar was first allowed to float freely. And the Fed's own monetary report details an alarming fact. Foreign entities have not only stopped purchasing U.S. securities; they have actually been selling them because they have lost, it appears, confidence in their value. Now, I am going to be raising some questions, Mr. Chairman, about that, and I will be interested in your observations about these reports in the Monetary Policy Report. As I have said previously, the catalyst of the current economic crisis I believe very strongly is the housing crisis. Overall, 2007 was the first year since data has been kept that the United States had an annual decline in nationwide housing prices. A recent Moody's report forecast that home values will drop in 2008 by 10 percent to 15 percent, and others are predicting similar declines in 2009 as well. This would be the first time since the Great Depression that national home prices have dropped in consecutive years. We have all witnessed in the past where regionally there have been declines in home prices, but to have national numbers like this is almost unprecedented, certainly in recent history. If the catalyst of the current economic crisis is the housing crisis, then the catalyst of the housing crisis is the foreclosure crisis. This week, it was reported that foreclosures in January were up 57 percent compared to a year ago and continue to hit record levels. When all is said and done, over 2 million Americans could lose their homes as a result of what Secretary Paulson has properly and accurately described as ``bad lending practices.'' These are lending practices that no sensible banker, I think, would ever engage in. Reckless, careless, and sometimes unscrupulous actors in the mortgage lending industry essentially allowed banks-- rather, essentially allowed loans to be made that they knew hard-working, law-abiding borrowers would never be able to repay. Let me add here very quickly, because I think it is important to make the point here, that we are not talking about everyone here at all. We are talking about some who engaged in practices that I think were unscrupulous or bad lending practices. But many institutions acted very responsibly, and I would not want the world to suggest here that this Committee believed that this was an indictment on all lending institutions. And engaged--those who did act improperly engaged in practices that the Federal Reserve under its prior leadership, in my view, and this administration did absolutely nothing to effectively stop. The crisis affects more than families who lose their homes. Property values for each home within a one-eighth square mile of a foreclosed home could drop on an average as much as $5,000. This will affect somewhere between 44 to 50 million homes in our country. So the ripple effect beyond the foreclosed property goes far beyond that and has a contagion effect, in my view, in our communities all across this country beyond the very stark reality of those who actually lose their homes, the effect of others watching the value of their properties decline, not to mention what that means to local tax bases, supporting local police and fire, and a variety of other concerns raised by this issue. I certainly want to commend the Fed Chairman--I said so yesterday publicly, Mr. Chairman; I do so again this morning-- for candidly acknowledging the weakness in the economy and for actively addressing those weaknesses by injecting liquidity and cutting interest rates. I also am pleased that the administration and the Congress were able to reach agreement on a stimulus package, and our hope is--while some have argued this is not big enough or strong enough, our collective hope is this will work, will have some very positive impact on the economy. Certainly this will have some support, we hope, for working families who are bearing the brunt of these very difficult times. However, I think more needs to be done to address the root cause of our economic problems. Any serious effort to address our economic woes should include, I think, an effort to take on the foreclosure crisis. And, again, there are various ideas out there on how we might do this more effectively, and certainly the Chairman and others have offered some ideas and suggestions. Senator Shelby and I have been working and talking--and Mel Martinez and others who are involved in these issues--about ways in which we can in the coming days do constructive things in a positive way to indicate and show not only our concern about the issue but some very strong ideas on how we can right this and restore that confidence I talked about earlier. We on this Committee have already taken some steps to address these problems. We have passed the FHA modernization legislation through the Committee and the Senate and continue to work to make it law. We had a very good meeting yesterday, I would point out, Senator Shelby and I and the leadership of the House Financial Services Committee, I say to you, Mr. Chairman, in hopes that we can come to some very quick conclusion on that piece of legislation and move it along here. We appropriated close to $200 million to facilitate foreclosure prevention efforts by borrowers and lenders, and I want to commend Senator Schumer and others who have been involved in this idea of counseling and ideas to minimize the impact of this problem as well. In addition, the recently enacted stimulus package that I mentioned already includes a temporary increase in the conforming loan limits for GSEs to try to address the problems that have spread throughout the credit market and the jumbo mortgage market. And while this temporary increase is helpful, we still need to implement broad GSE reform. And as I have said previously, I am committed to doing that, and we will get that done. I have spoken about my belief in the need for additional steps to mitigate the foreclosure crisis in a reasonable and thoughtful manner. These steps include targeting some community development block grant assistance to communities in a targeted way to help them to counter the impact of foreclosed and abandoned properties in their communities. And they include establishing a temporary homeownership loan initiative, which I have raised and others have commented on, either using existing platforms or a new entity that can facilitate mortgage refinancing. But it is not just the Congress that needs to do more, and, again, the Fed needs, in my view, to be as vigilant a financial regulator as it has been a monetary policymaker. That includes breaking with its past and becoming more vigilant about policing indefensible lending practices. And, again, I commend the Chairman of the Federal Reserve--we have talked about this here--on the proposed regulations that you have articulated that would follow on the HOEPA legislation. And while I have expressed some disappointment about how far they go in certain areas here, the Chairman and I have talked about this a bit. We will be involved in the comment period here and are looking forward to finalizing those regulations, and hopefully at least shutting the door on this kind of a problem re-emerging in the coming months and years. So I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, and your colleagues and urge them to consider some of the stronger measures, and we will offer some additional comments on them. Despite these unprecedented challenges, I think all of us here on this Committee, Republicans and Democrats, remain confident in the future of the American economy, and our concerns that will be raised here this morning should not reflect anything but that confidence in the future. We may need to change some of our policies, regulations, and priorities, but we strongly believe that the ingenuity, productivity, and capability of the American worker and the entrepreneur ought never to be underestimated in this country. And we remain firm and committed to doing everything we can to strengthen those very points. So I look forward to working with my good friend, Senator Shelby, and other Members of the Committee to do what we can here to play our role in all of this in a constructive way, to work with you, Mr. Chairman, and the Federal Reserve, the Secretary of the Treasury, and others of the financial institution regulators to see what we can do in the short term to get this moving in a better direction. So, with that, let me turn to Senator Shelby for his opening comments, and then we will try to get to some questions. And I will leave opening comments for the go-around and question period so we can get to a question-and-answer period here to make this as productive a session as possible. But we thank you again for being with us.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Chairman Bernanke, we are pleased to have you again before the Committee to deliver the Federal Reserve's Semiannual Monetary Policy Report. I will keep my remarks brief this morning as we are all here to hear your views on the U.S. economy and other related issues. We also have the benefit of having read about your remarks before the House yesterday. Chairman Bernanke, the Federal Reserve has taken a number of steps over the past 6 months to address the tightening of credit markets and the slowdown in economic growth. In a bid to improve interbank liquidity, the Federal Reserve established the term auction facility in December of last year and has conducted, as I understand it, six auctions to date. Since last August, the Federal Open Market Committee has reduced the Federal funds target a total of 225 basis points, taking the target from 5.25 percent to 3 percent. Mr. Chairman, since monetary policy works with a lag, the full impact of this boost to the economy is not yet clear to you or to us. I know that we will spend time this morning discussing the length and the depth of the housing correction that Senator Dodd alluded to, and I think we should. I also want to make sure, however, that this Committee focuses on the risks associated with increasing inflation. The Labor Department, Mr. Chairman, reported this week, as you know, that wholesale price inflation hit a 26-year high in January. The January rise in the Consumer Price Index meant a 12-month change in the overall CPI of 4.3 percent, twice the pace of a year ago. In addition, gold and oil are at all-time highs. These numbers certainly raise questions, Mr. Chairman, as to how much more room the Federal Reserve will have to provide further monetary accommodation without threatening long-term price stability, which is very important to all of us. While it is difficult to see our Nation's economy experience minimal growth, the consequences of failing to restrain inflation will be far more painful and more difficult to unwind. Chairman Bernanke, we are pleased to have you with us this morning, and we look forward to your thoughts on this and other issues.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much. Let me correct myself. The tradition has been, Mr. Chairman, if Members do want to make some opening comments at a moment like this, and I do not want to break that tradition. So I am going to ask if any Members would like to make any opening comments at this point, I would be happy to entertain them. I realize that has been the tradition of the Committee, and I do not want to violate the traditions of the Committee. Does any Member want to be heard, some opening comments to make at this point? If they would like to, I would be happy to entertain----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Let me ask a question. If we do not make them now and we make them during our timeframe, does that limit how many questions we can ask?",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, that is the idea. I mean, I do not want to limit your time, but----",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","So if you would like to----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Make your opening statement.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","That would make Chairman Bernanke happy.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","I understand that, and that is why you get the gavel after 27 years. But if you would like to make an opening comment----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","OK.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","All right. Anyone else who would like to be heard?",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Why don't you add a minute and do both?",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","We will add a minute. Why don't I add a minute to the time here? Instead of having 5 or 6 minutes, we will make it 7 or 8 minutes. And I have never tried to be too rigid about that, and so we will do it that way if that is all right. That will move things along. Is that OK with everyone? Thank you very much. Mr. Chairman, we welcome you to the Committee.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you. Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and other Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. In my testimony this morning, I will briefly review the economic situation and outlook, beginning with developments in real activity and inflation, and then turn to monetary policy.",Statement,STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Chairman, would you please move that microphone a little closer so we can all hear you?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","How is this?",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is good.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I will conclude with a quick update on the Federal Reserve's recent actions to help protect consumers in their financial dealings. The economic situation has become distinctly less favorable since the time of our July report. Strains in financial markets, which first became evident late last summer, have persisted; and pressures on bank capital and the continued poor functioning of markets for securitized credit have led to tighter credit conditions for many households and businesses. The growth of real gross domestic product held up well through the third quarter despite the financial turmoil, but it has since slowed sharply. Labor market conditions have similarly softened, as job creation has slowed and the unemployment rate--at 4.9 percent in January--has moved up somewhat. Many of the challenges now facing our economy stem from the continuing contraction of the U.S. housing market. In 2006, after a multiyear boom in residential construction and house prices, the housing market reversed course. Housing starts and sales of new homes are now less than half of their respective peaks, and house prices have flattened or declined in many areas. Changes in the availability of mortgage credit amplified the swings in the housing market. During the housing sector's expansion phase, increasingly lax lending standards, particularly in the subprime market, raised the effective demand for housing, pushing up prices and stimulating construction activity. As the housing market began to turn down, however, the slump in subprime mortgage originations, together with a more general tightening of credit conditions, has served to increase the severity of the downturn. Weaker house prices in turn have contributed to the deterioration in the performance of mortgage-related securities and reduced the availability of mortgage credit. The housing market is expected to continue to weigh on economic activity in coming quarters. Home builders, still faced with abnormally high inventories of unsold homes, are likely to cut the pace of their building activity further, which will subtract from overall growth and reduce employment in residential construction and closely related industries. Consumer spending continued to increase at a solid pace through much of the second half of 2007, despite the problems in the housing market, but it appears to have slowed significantly toward the end of the year. The jump in the price of imported energy, which eroded real incomes and wages, likely contributed to the slowdown in spending, as did the declines in household wealth associated with the weakness in house prices and equity prices. Slowing job creation is yet another potential drag on household spending, as gains in payroll employment averaged little more than 40,000 per month during the 3 months ending in January, compared with an average increase of almost 100,000 per month over the previous 3 months. However, the recently enacted fiscal stimulus package should provide some support for household spending during the second half of this year and into next year. The business sector has also displayed signs of being affected by the difficulties in the housing and credit markets. Reflecting a downshift in the growth of final demand and tighter credit conditions for some firms, available indicators suggest that investment in equipment and software will be subdued during the first half of 2008. Likewise, after growing robustly through much of 2007, nonresidential construction is likely to decelerate sharply in coming quarters as business activity slows and funding becomes harder to obtain, especially for more speculative projects. On a more encouraging note, we see few signs of any serious imbalances in business inventories aside from the overhang of unsold homes. And, as a whole, the nonfinancial business sector remains in good financial condition, with strong profits, liquid balance sheets, and corporate leverage near historical lows. In addition, the vigor of the global economy has offset some of the weakening of domestic demand. U.S. real exports of goods and services increased at an annual rate of about 11 percent in the second half of last year, boosted by continuing economic growth abroad and the lower foreign exchange value of the dollar. Strengthening exports, together with moderating imports, have in turn led to some improvement in the U.S. current account deficit, which likely narrowed in 2007--on an annual basis--for the first time since 2001. Although recent indicators point to some slowing of foreign economic growth, U.S. exports should continue to expand at a healthy pace in coming quarters, providing some impetus to domestic economic activity and employment. As I have mentioned, financial markets continue to be under considerable stress. Heightened investor concerns about the credit quality of mortgages, especially subprime mortgages with adjustable interest rates, triggered the financial turmoil. However, other factors, including a broader retrenchment in the willingness of investors to bear risk, difficulties in valuing complex or illiquid financial products, uncertainties about the exposures of major financial institutions to credit losses, and concerns about the weaker outlook for economic growth, have also roiled the financial markets in recent months. To help relieve the pressures in the market for interbank lending, the Federal Reserve--among other actions--recently introduced a term auction facility, through which prespecified amounts of discount window credit are auctioned to eligible borrowers, and we have been working with other central banks to address market strains that could hamper the achievement of our broader economic objectives. These efforts appear to have contributed to some improvement in short-term funding markets. We will continue to monitor financial developments closely. As part of its ongoing commitment to improving the accountability and public understanding of monetary policymaking, the Federal Open Market Committee--or FOMC-- recently increased the frequency and expanded the content of the economic projections made by Federal Reserve Board members and Reserve Bank presidents and released to the public. The latest economic projections, which were submitted in conjunction with the FOMC meeting at the end of January and which are based on each participant's assessment of appropriate monetary policy, show that real GDP was expected to grow only sluggishly in the next few quarters and that the unemployment rate was likely to increase somewhat. In particular, the central tendency of the projections was for real GDP to grow between 1.3 percent and 2.0 percent in 2008, down from 2\1/2\ percent to 2\3/4\ percent projected in our report last July. FOMC participants' projections for the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of 2008 have a central tendency of 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent, up from the level of about 4\3/4\ percent projected last July for the same period. The downgrade in our projections for economic activity in 2008 since our report last July reflects the effects of the financial turmoil on real activity and a housing contraction that has been more severe than previously expected. By 2010, our most recent projections show output growth picking up to rates close to or a little above its longer-term trend and the unemployment rate edging lower; the improvement reflects the effects of policy stimulus and an anticipated moderation of the contraction in housing and the strains in financial and credit markets. The incoming information since our January meeting continues to suggest sluggish economic activity in the near term. The risks to this outlook remain to the downside. The risks include the possibilities that the housing market or the labor market may deteriorate more than is currently anticipated and that credit conditions may tighten substantially further. Consumer price inflation has increased since our previous report, in substantial part because of the steep run-up in the price of oil. Last year, food prices also increased significantly, and the dollar depreciated. Reflecting these influences, the price index for personal consumption expenditures--or PCE--increased 3.4 percent over the four quarters of 2007, up from 1.9 percent in 2006. Core price inflation--that is, inflation excluding food and energy prices--also firmed toward the end of the year. The higher recent readings likely reflected some pass-through of energy costs to the prices of core consumer goods and services as well as the effect of the depreciation of the dollar on import prices. Moreover, core inflation in the first half of 2007 was damped by a number of transitory factors--notably, unusually soft prices for apparel and for financial services--which subsequently reversed. For the year as a whole, however, core PCE prices increased 2.1 percent, down slightly from 2006. The projections recently submitted by FOMC participants indicate that overall PCE inflation was expected to moderate significantly in 2008, to between 2.1 percent and 2.4 percent-- the central tendency of the projections. A key assumption underlying those projections was that energy and food prices would begin to flatten out, as implied by quotes on futures markets. In addition, diminishing pressure on resources is also consistent with the projected slowing in inflation. The central tendency of the projections for core PCE inflation in 2008, at 2.0 percent to 2.2 percent, was a bit higher than in our July report, largely because of some higher-than-expected recent readings on prices. Beyond 2008, both overall and core inflation were projected to edge lower, as participants expected inflation expectations to remain reasonably well anchored and pressures on resource utilization to be muted. The inflation projections submitted by FOMC participants for 2010-- which ranged from 1.5 percent to 2.0 percent for overall PCE inflation--were importantly influenced by participants' judgments about the measured rates of inflation consistent with the Federal Reserve's dual mandate and about the timeframe over which policy should aim to achieve those rates. The rate of inflation that is actually realized will, of course, depend on a variety of factors. Inflation could be lower than we anticipate if slower-than-expected global growth moderates the pressure on the prices of energy and other commodities or if rates of domestic resource utilization fall more than we currently expect. Upside risks to the inflation projection are also present, however, including the possibilities that energy and food prices do not flatten out or that the pass-through to core prices from higher commodity prices and from the weaker dollar may be greater than we anticipate. Indeed, the further increases in the prices of energy and other commodities in recent weeks, together with the latest data on consumer prices, suggest slightly greater upside risks to the projections of both overall and core inflation than we saw last month. Should high rates of overall inflation persist, the possibility also exists that inflation expectations could become less well anchored. Any tendency of inflation expectations to become unmoored or for the Fed's inflation-fighting credibility to be eroded could greatly complicate the task of sustaining price stability and could reduce the flexibility of the FOMC to counter shortfalls in growth in the future. Accordingly, in the months ahead, the Federal Reserve will continue to monitor closely inflation and inflation expectations. Let me turn now to the implications of these developments for monetary policy. The FOMC has responded aggressively to the weaker outlook for economic activity, having reduced its target for the Federal funds rate by 225 basis points since last summer. As the Committee noted in its most recent post-meeting statement, the intent of those actions has been to help promote moderate growth over time and to mitigate the risks to economic activity. A critical task for the Federal Reserve over the course of this year will be to assess whether the stance of monetary policy is properly calibrated to foster our mandated objectives of maximum employment and price stability in an environment of downside risks to growth, stressed financial conditions, and inflation pressures. In particular, the FOMC will need to judge whether the policy actions taken thus far are having their intended effects. Monetary policy works with a lag. Therefore, our policy stance must be determined in light of the medium- term forecast for real activity and inflation as well as by the risks to that forecast. Although the FOMC participants' economic projections envision an improving economic picture, it is important to recognize that downside risks to growth remain. The FOMC will be carefully evaluating incoming information bearing on the economic outlook and will act in a timely manner as needed to support growth and to provide adequate insurance against downside risks. Finally, I would like to say a few words about the Federal Reserve's recent actions to protect consumers in their financial transactions. In December, following up on a commitment I made at the time of our report last July, the Board issued for public comment a comprehensive set of new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, under the authority granted us by the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994. The proposed rules would apply to all mortgage lenders and would establish lending standards to help ensure that consumers who seek mortgage credit receive loans whose terms are clearly disclosed and that can reasonably be expected to be repaid. Accordingly, the rules would prohibit lenders from engaging in a pattern or practice of making higher-priced mortgage loans without due regard to consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments. In each case, a lender making a higher-priced loan would have to use third-party documents to verify the income relied on to make the credit decision. For higher-priced loans, the proposed rules would require the lender to establish an escrow account for the payment of property taxes and homeowners' insurance and would prevent the use of prepayment penalties in circumstances where they might trap borrowers in unaffordable loans. In addition, for all mortgage loans, our proposal addresses misleading and deceptive advertising practices, requires borrowers and brokers to agree in advance on the maximum fee that the broker may receive, bans certain practices by servicers that harm borrowers, and prohibits coercion of appraisers by lenders. We expect substantial public comment on our proposal, and we will carefully consider all information and viewpoints while moving expeditiously to adopt final rules. The effectiveness of the new regulations, however, will depend critically on strong enforcement. To that end, in conjunction with other Federal and State agencies, we are conducting compliance reviews of a range of mortgage lenders, including nondepository lenders. The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examinations of, and improved enforcement for, all categories of mortgage lenders. The Federal Reserve continues to work with financial institutions, public officials, and community groups around the country to help homeowners avoid foreclosures. We have called on mortgage lenders and servicers to pursue prudent loan workouts and have supported the development of a streamlined, systematic approach to expedite the loan modification process. We also have been providing community groups, counseling agencies, regulators, and others with detailed analyses to help identify neighborhoods at high risk from foreclosures so that local outreach efforts to help troubled borrowers can be as focused and effective as possible. We are actively pursuing other ways to leverage the Federal Reserve's analytical resources, regional presence, and community connections to address this critical issue. In addition to our consumer protection efforts in the mortgage area, we are working toward finalizing rules under the Truth in Lending Act that will require new, more informative, and consumer-tested disclosures by credit card issuers. Separately, we are actively reviewing potentially unfair and deceptive practices by issuers of credit cards. Using the Board's authority under the Federal Trade Commission Act, we expect to issue proposed rules regarding these practices this spring. Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. We will make these 7 to 8 minutes, and, again, I will not be rigid about the time constraints. Let me begin, Mr. Chairman, by going back to that old question that was asked more than, I guess, 30 years ago. I will sort of paraphrase on it, and that is, are we better off today to respond to this situation than we were--in this case I want to ask 7 years ago. The question that Ronald Reagan asked, I think, in 1980 in that campaign, Are we better off today than we were yesterday? And the reason I raise that is because I have been struck by the similarities between 2001 and that period going into, potentially falling into a recession, and here we are in 2008. The parallel seems striking to me in some ways, and I want you to comment on this, if you could. At both moments in this 7-year period, we are on the brink of a recession--at least it seems so. The Fed was cutting interest rates very aggressively. A major asset bubble--in this case, it was the high-tech community rather than housing--was bursting. Yet despite those similarities, the differences in the basic economic information seems to be very, very different as well. Americans had just experienced the greatest economic boom in a generation. Real wages had gone up substantially. Income inequality had narrowed. The Federal Government was in a surplus. In fact, on this very Committee, your predecessor came to a hearing--I do not know who else was on the Committee in those days, but he came and talked about the things we ought to think about by retiring the national debt entirely. There were some downsides to that, and we actually had a very good hearing with Alan Greenspan about that very question in 2001. The dollar was at record highs as well, and, of course, today we are in the opposite position, with the dollar at its lowest level since we began floating currencies in 1973. Inflation is at a 17-year high. Real wages are falling, and we are faced with record Government debt and deficits. A very different fact situation than was the case in 2001. In 2001, as well, one might argue that there were deliberate actions taken by the Federal Reserve to deal with rising inflation. So the steps were in response to inflation here. Obviously, what is provoking, I think, the action--and you can certainly comment on this--is a different fact situation. So the question appears in a sense: Are we in a--what would be your analysis? Are we in a--comparing these two periods in time of history, relatively close to each other, faced with similar situations, it would appear to me that we are not in as strong a position to respond to this as we were in 2001. And so the question is, Are we better off? And if so, I would like you to explain why. And if not, what should we be doing and what different steps should we be taking if we cannot rely on these basic underlying strengths that occurred in 2001 that helped us at that time as opposed to where we are today?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, there are certainly some similarities with the 2001 experience, most obviously the sharp change in asset price. In the previous case, it was the stock market, the tech stocks; in this case, it is home prices. But there are some important differences as well, as you point out. The decline in home prices is creating a much broader set of issues, both for borrowers and homeowners, but also for the credit markets. And so we have a sustained disruption in the credit process which has gone on now since last August and is not yet near completion. That is a continuing drag on the economy and a continuing problem for us as we try to restore stronger growth. The other problem is that we do have greater inflation pressure at this point than we did in 2001, and that is coming from oil. In 2001, the price of oil was somewhere around $20. Today it is $100.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","The increase in commodity prices around the world as the global economy expands and increases demand for those commodities is creating an inflationary stress which is complicating the Federal Reserve's attempts to respond. In some other ways, things are different. You pointed out the dollar was very strong in 2001. That was in part reflective of a large trade deficit at that time. It has since depreciated. But, on the other hand, part of the effect of that depreciation has been that we are at least seeing some improvement in that trade deficit, which is a positive factor. On the fiscal situation, I agree we are in a less advantageous situation than we were. The deficit is certainly higher, and perhaps even more seriously, we are now 7 years further on toward the retirement of the baby boomers and the entitlements, and those costs that are certainly bearing down on us as we speak. So it is a difficult situation, and there are multiple factors. I think there are some similarities, but as a Russian novelist once said, ``Unhappy families are all unhappy in their own way,'' and every period of financial and economic stress has unique characteristics.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, do you have any recommendations, then, differently here? If we are responding in a very similar way with different underlying economic fact situations, are there other things we ought to be doing here, taking any kind of a different approach? Or are we secure in feeling that the present course of action being taken by the Fed and by the administration is going to produce the desired results? That period of recession lasted about 8 months. There are fears that this one, if it takes hold, could be far more long-lasting for the very reasons we have outlined in the underlying problems economically that exist.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, to some extent, the private sector is going to have to work through the problems in the financial markets. That is something that they will have to do with the help and guidance of the regulators and the supervisors, which we are certainly doing. We are reviewing our practices and our policies and trying to see how we can improve them. With respect to the broader economy, of course, we have both monetary and fiscal policy action now underway, which I hope will, and we project will, lead to stronger growth in the second half of this year. An important issue, as you have already alluded to, is the effects of the home price declines on consumers and, in particular, the delinquencies and foreclosures which we are now seeing. I have described briefly in my remarks some of the things that we have done in calling on private servicers and lenders to scale up their activities, to use more streamlined processes. I think it is important for us and for the servicers to move beyond temporary palliatives that they are using in many cases with delinquent borrowers and try to find more permanent, sustainable solutions in terms of restructuring mortgages or refinancing into the FHA or other mechanisms. Congress has already taken some steps, as you mentioned, and would urge you to continue to work on FHA modernization and GSE reform.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Those are two areas that can help us meet these challenges. Additional steps may be necessary in the future, but at this point, I think we have taken a number of useful steps. We need to keep thinking about possible future options, but I do not have any additional recommendations right now.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","I do not want to put words in your mouth, obviously, at all here, but I am looking at--obviously the housing burst or bubble, the burst of that bubble is, I think, far more dangerous than a high-tech problem, as you make those comparisons. Inflation and trade deficits are worse. Am I hearing you correctly that we are actually in a worse position today to respond to this than we were 8 years ago? Is that how I hear what you are saying?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I think that is fair in that both fiscal and monetary policy face some additional constraints. Many people owned stocks, too, of course, and so that affected their wealth and their willingness to spend. But, in fact, the effects of the stock market declines in 2001 were primarily on investment firms than on consumers. In this case, the consumers are taking the brunt of the effects.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","That is a good additional point. I did not make that.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, as I noted earlier, wholesale prices rose by 1 percent in January and 7.4 percent over the past year. This is the fastest increase in 26 years. In your opening statement, you noted greater upside risks to both overall and core inflation than we saw previously. Additionally, the most recent minutes of the Federal Open Market Committee gave anecdotal evidence that in some instances these price increases were passed on to consumers. The FOMC also noted a risk that inflation expectations could become less anchored. Do you have any concern at all that the 225 basis-point cut to the Federal funds rate has limited the options that can be used to combat the upside risk of inflation?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, to answer that question, the PPI, the Producer Price Index, that you referred to mostly reflects the effects of large increases in prices of energy and other commodities. We live in a world where energy and metals and other commodities are globally traded, food as well, and demand of emerging market economies and a growing global economy has put pressure on the available supplies of those resources and has driven up those prices. And as I mentioned, the price of oil has quintupled or more.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Do you see that abating?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","In 2007, the price of oil rose by about two- thirds, and I suspect--and the futures markets agree--that it is much more likely that oil prices, while remaining high, will not increase by anything like that amount going forward. If oil prices and food prices do stabilize to some extent, even if they do not fall, that will be sufficient to bring inflation down as we have projected. Now, you are correct, though, that we do have to be very cautious. While we cannot do much about oil prices or food prices in the short run, we do have to be careful to make sure that those prices do not either feed substantially into other types of prices, other goods and services produced domestically, and that they do not dislodge inflation expectations or make the public less confident that the Federal Reserve will, in fact, control inflation, as we will. So we do have to watch those things very carefully, and will watch them very carefully.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Is that what some of us would talk about, the psychology of inflation?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, that is another way to put it. But, yes, inflation expectations essentially are measured many different ways, and I think the evidence is that they remain pretty stable. If you look at forecasters' long-term inflation expectations, consumer surveys, and even the financial markets, they show that inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. But it is certainly something we have to watch very carefully.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Do you believe that setting a Fed funds rate target lower than the inflation rate--that is, a negative real rate of interest--can be an appropriate response to an economic slowdown? In other words, how long can the Fed run a negative real rate before inflationary pressures grow to dangerous levels?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, there are different ways to measure the real interest rate. The one that is relevant is the one that is looking forward, and, again, if oil prices do not continue to rise at this pace they have, I think we would still be on the positive side of the real interest rate. Now, in the past, the Fed has for short periods lowered the rate to a negative level, but as you point out, that is not something you want to do for a sustained period.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","The Fed cannot ignore price stability, can it, when you are making these decisions to have more liquidity in the financial market?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, we are facing a situation where we have simultaneously a slowdown in the economy, stress in the financial markets, and inflation pressure coming from these commodity prices abroad. And each of those things represents a challenge. We have to make our policy in trying to balance those different risks in a way that will get the best possible outcome for the American economy.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Would you be trying to avoid stagflation, as some people call it?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I do not anticipate stagflation. I do not think we are anywhere near the situation that prevailed in the 1970's. I do expect inflation to come down. If it does not, we will have to react to it, but I do expect that inflation will come down and that we will have both return to growth and price stability as we move forward.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Do you still believe that the fundamentals of our economy is still robust, is strong, other than the housing market and some of the financial challenges that we have coming out of that?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I realize my testimony was not the most cheerful thing you will hear today, and I was thinking very much about the short-term challenges that we face in terms of the financial markets and growth and inflation. But I do very much believe that the U.S. economy will return to a strong growth path with price stability. We have enormous resources, resilience, productivity, and I am quite confident in the American economy and the American people that we will have strong economic growth in the next few years.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Mr. Chairman, a commonly watched measure of inflation, as you well know, is the core CPI. Housing constitutes, I understand, almost a third of the core CPI. To what extent has the recent decline in housing prices moderated recent increases in the core CPI? As housing prices go down, inflation, you know, should play here in a negative way, should it not?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, not necessarily. You can get actually a perverse effect, which is that as house prices----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","And how would that work?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","As house prices fall, people will become more reluctant to buy a house because they are afraid that the house price will keep falling, so they rent instead. And that puts pressure on rents and actually could drive up the rent.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Good for the landlords and bad for the sellers.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","It can be, and the way the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates the cost of homeownership, it uses a lot of information from measured rents. So you can actually get--as we did last year--a period where the cost of homeownership as measured by the BLS actually went up, even though house prices were coming down, because of the fact that people were renting more and rental costs were going up. That effect has moderated somewhat recently, and that has helped to keep down----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","What would be the trend from your perspective in the core CPI if house prices were excluded?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","House prices are not included----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","I know they are not, but what if you did exclude them? What would be the trend in the core CPI?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I am sorry. House prices are not included in the----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","OK, they are not.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","In the CPI. What is included----",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","They are excluded.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","The measure of shelter costs is related to rents drawn from various sources.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","One more question, Mr. Chairman. What do you judge to be the threat of slow growth continuing with inflation remaining above the Federal Reserve's comfort level? What would you say to that? In other words, what do you judge to be the threat of the slow growth continuing with inflation remaining above your comfort level?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, we are certainly aiming to achieve our mandate, which is maximum employment and price stability. We project that that will be happening. We are watching very carefully because there are risks to those projections. One of the risks, obviously, is the performance of the financial markets, and that again, as I mentioned before, complicates the situation. As events unfold--and certainly there are many things that we cannot control or cannot anticipate at this point--we are simply going to have to keep weighing the different risks and trying to find an appropriate balance for policy going forward.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","As a bank regulator, too--this will be my last question, Mr. Chairman--do you fear some bank failures in this country? I know there are big risks where they are heavily involved in real estate lending. Does that bother you as a bank regulator?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I believe the FDIC and the OCC have recently provided some information. There probably will be some bank failures. There are, for example, some small or in many cases de novo banks that are heavily invested in real estate in locales where prices have fallen, and, therefore, they would be under some pressure. So I expect there will be some failures. Among the largest banks, the capital ratios remain good, and I do not anticipate any serious problems of that sort among the large internationally active banks that make up a very substantial part of our banking system.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Do you see some of those larger banks seeking additional capital to bolster themselves?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","They have already sought something on the order of $75 billion in capital in the last quarter.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Is that enough?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I would like to see them get more. They have enough now certainly to remain solvent and to remain above, well above their minimum capital levels. But I am concerned that banks will be pulling back and not making new loans and providing the credit, which is the lifeblood of the economy. In order to be able to do that, they need in many cases--not all cases, but in some cases at least--they need to get more capital.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me just say to the Chairman, I said this to him privately, but I really appreciate your candor in all of this. Your job is not to be a cheerleader but to lay out for us exactly how you see things. And I for one, anyway--I do not know if other Members feel likewise, but I am very appreciative of the fact that you are very clear and very straightforward on your assessment of these matters, and that is important.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And, Chairman Bernanke, welcome. I will say first that you bring to this very challenging job great intellect and great integrity, and I appreciate it very much. And it is a daunting moment in our economic history. You said in rather unemotional terms, characteristically talked about the squeeze that families are feeling. What I have heard in Rhode Island is exactly the same thing: increased costs for practically everything you need, flat wages, and then the housing problem taking away that sense of well reserve if something goes wrong. In fact, I was particularly struck by comments that were related to me about the bakers in Rhode Island, the family bakeries who have seen the price of wheat go up 200, 300, 400 percent. It is unprecedented, frankly. And if that continues, we are going to have real serious, serious problems, as you alluded to. The Fed has two major responsibilities: monetary policy but regulation of large financial institutions. And in that latter category, I alluded to this in our last conversation in the Committee about your take on, frankly, how well you have activated your regulatory responsibilities in these last few years. We have seen major institutions write off billions of dollars, and mostly because of off-balance-sheet transactions. And it is quite clear that the Fed is there on a daily basis in all the institutions. I think the former Chairman of the CEA, Martin Feldstein, wrote, ``The Fed's banking examiners have complete access to all the financial transactions of the banks that they supervise and should have the technical expertise to evaluate the risks that those banks are taking.'' Well, it seems quite clear now, with the restatement of balance sheets that these banks are taking lots of risks that they did not really see as risks. Are you satisfied that you have in place the regulatory procedures? And are you--I do not know what the right word is-- disappointed that your regulatory apparatus did not alert the banks or monitor the banks more closely over the last several months?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, you raise some important questions. First of all, we and our fellow regulators, both in the United States and around the world, are engaged, as you might imagine, in a very serious review of what has happened and what we can do better in the future. The Federal Reserve itself is looking at our own practices and staffing and all those issues. The President's Working Group is working on a set of recommendations looking broadly at the financial markets and the problems that arose. And all of those discussions and information will be feeding into an international analysis--the Financial Stability Forum, the Basel Committee, international groups of financial regulators, central banks, Finance Ministers, and so on--which will try to determine, what the problems were, where we can do better, and what we have learned from this episode. So we are certainly doing a lot of stock taking and trying to determine where there were problems. In terms of the banks it should be emphasized that we do work very closely with the other regulators--the OCC, the FDIC, and others, depending on the type of bank. Our focus, I think of necessity, is for the most part on things such as the overall structure of risk management, the practices and procedures that the banks follow. It is very difficult for us to second-guess the specific asset price or asset purchase decisions that they make. I think going forward we do need to look in a much tougher way at the risk management and risk measurement procedures that the banks have. But, again, it is very difficult for us to tell a bank that--when they make a certain investment that they think it is a good investment, and they have done all the due diligence-- that it is a bad investment. That is not usually our role.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Let me follow up with two questions and ask for a brief response. First, when do you anticipate sharing with this Committee the results of this analysis you are doing of your regulatory position within the next several months in a detailed basis?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the President's Working Group and then the international bodies--the Financial Stability Forum, the Basel Committee--are anticipating sharing these reports within the next couple of months. The Financial Stability Forum has already issued a preliminary interim report trying to identify the areas of weakness and problems.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Another question, and this goes back to sort of the level of detail. Do your examiners look at what is happening on the trading desks of these large institutions in real time and then compare it to what is happening on the asset side? I mean, there has been a suggestion in some institutions that while they were being booked, some of these investments, at a reasonably high price, the traders were selling at a deep discount. Is that something that you did or propose to do in the future?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, again, we cannot look over the shoulder of every trader on every trade, but what we can try to do is ensure that the systems exist so that the bank is ensuring that the appropriate markdowns are taking place so that they are consistent between the trade and the booking. So we do look at the systems and the risk management systems to try to determine if they are properly managed.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Well, you know, I think we have a problem here, frankly, maybe because--and, again, you can take a systematic procedure, see that the procedures are all in place, but if the procedures are missing a major point or the assumptions underlying the procedures are outdated--and I would hope that your review would be prompt and timely and allow us to see details of what you have been looking at. Let me ask a question. You brought up Basel II. One of the aspects of Basel II, to my understanding, is a reliance on ratings and rating agencies. In fact, it has been reported that Northern Rock, the British institution that failed that has now been nationalized by the British Government, was able to lower their risk-weighted assets by 44 percent under Basel II. The CEO at the time described it as the ``benefits of Basel.'' I suspect he is not describing it as that--certainly the Prime Minister is not describing it as the ``benefits of Basel'' now. Does that give you pause with respect to rushing forward with Basel II?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Basel II, I still believe, is the right direction. It is based on properly measuring risk and relating capital to the amount of risk that you are taking. I think in the case of Northern Rock, the real, most serious problems were not in the asset quality but, in fact, were due to a lack of liquidity planning because they did not have sources of liquidity when the run occurred, essentially. And we in our implementation of Basel II here in the United States do make liquidity planning an important part of our analysis. You mentioned credit ratings. It is true that credit ratings do play a role in some of the Basel II risk evaluations. They do not play a unique role. It is generally the case that banks are expected to make independent evaluations along with taking information from the credit ratings. However, this is certainly one of the areas where the Basel Committee, in reviewing the lessons of the recent events, is looking carefully on how or whether to use credit ratings in the risk measurement process.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Dodd.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, excellent questions. And, Mr. Chairman, just picking up on Jack Reed's questions here, it may be worth--I had not thought about the Basel implications. We have looked at this thing, obviously, in a more parochial way, but I might ask the Chairman of the Fed to give us--we had one hearing on this. Senator Shelby cares deeply about this issue, as I do as well, the rating agencies. It is a complicated issue. But I think all of us would be deeply appreciative of some ideas from the Fed to us. If there is any need here for legislative action at all in this area, we would be very interested in hearing your thoughts and ideas on that as well.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, the Basel Accord is implemented by regulation, and we have determined a joint action by the four bank regulators. We are working together through regulation to try to make improvements. We will certainly take a lot of advice from the Basel Committee and the changes and suggestions that they make. We have a very conservative process in place for introducing the Basel II system, which includes several years of transition floors that will not allow capital to decline very much, and a lookback study that will review the experience both here in the United States and elsewhere to try to understand and make sure that we are confident that the system is going to develop appropriately and provide enough capital for banks. So we will be taking the lessons of the recent experience very much to heart and incorporating them in the system. Basel II has the virtue of being flexible enough that it can adjust when you make changes like this. So I do not think at this point that legislation is necessary.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","OK. Well, I am pleased to hear that, and as I said, it is an excellent question that Senator Reed has asked.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and welcome, Chairman Bernanke. I trust you saw the piece in this morning's Wall Street Journal, the op-ed piece by Allan Meltzer.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","``That 1970's Show.'' I will give you an opportunity to comment on that.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Mr. Meltzer, who is an excellent economist and indeed who is a historian of the Federal Reserve, is concerned that the current situation will begin to look like the 1970s, with very high inflation and high unemployment. I would dispute his analysis on the grounds that I do believe that monetary policy has to be forward looking, has to be based on where we think the economy and the inflation rate are heading. And as I said, the current inflation is due primarily to commodity prices--oil and energy and other prices--that are being set in global markets. I believe that those prices are likely to stabilize, or at least not to continue to rise at the pace that we have seen recently. If that is the case, then inflation should come down, and we should have, therefore, the ability to respond to what is both a slowdown in growth and a significant problem in the financial markets. He is correct, however, that there is some risk, and if the inflation expectations look to be coming unmoored, or if the prices of energy and commodities begin to feed into other costs of goods and services, we would have to take that very seriously. I mentioned that core inflation last year was 2.1 percent, so it is food prices and energy prices, which are internationally traded commodities, which are the bulk of the inflation problem. Again, we do have to watch it very carefully, but I do not think we are anywhere near the 1970s type situation.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Thank you. I wanted to get that on the record. As I look at the housing market and talk to some of my friends who are in the housing market, they tell me that the inventory is not monolithic, the inventory overhang--that is that the bulk of the overhang is in the higher-priced homes, because home builders wanted to build places where they would get the highest margin return, and if they built houses in the moderate housing area or affordable housing, their margins were not nearly as great and there were plenty of speculators willing to buy the bigger homes. And, indeed, they tell me that for affordable housing, there is, frankly, not a sufficient supply right now. They are urging me to do something on fiscal policy to stimulate people to build cheaper houses, that the housing construction would begin to catch up--not catch up. Construction levels would begin to pick up, whereas now they are dormant, waiting for the overhang to be worked off. Do you have any data that supports that anecdotal report?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, we do have some data on investor-owned properties, and that has been increasing quite a bit. And my recollection is that among the mortgages that are having problems, something on the order of 20 percent of them are investor-owned; therefore, it is not a family that is being in risk of losing their home. So that is a significant consideration, and I think that in those cases investors who make a bad investment should bear the consequences.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","That is my own attitude as well. But we are having conversations about stimulus packages around here, and it had not occurred to me, until I had this information from people in the housing market, that if we could stimulate people to buy the lower-priced houses, and those are the people who need the shelter, anyway, and there is not a surplus of inventory there, that that would have a very salutary effect both in terms of taking care of people's needs and on the economy, because home builders would start to build again, they just would not be building in that portion of the housing market where there is an oversupply. But you do not have any specific data as to where the price points are in the inventory overhang?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I could probably obtain such data. I am not sure that directly trying to stimulate specific types of house construction is necessarily the most efficient way to go about it. Probably the better thing is to try to ensure strong employment so people have the income and they can purchase the home they want to have, or they can rent if they prefer. But I do not have the data with me.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Well, I would appreciate it if we could get some because I find this an intriguing idea. I know in Utah, which has not been hurt as badly by the housing problem as some other States--because we generate something like 30,000 new families every year that need houses. But in Utah, above a certain level, around $400,000, there is a glut of houses on the market and, therefore, nobody in that market or above can sell their house. But for houses in the $200,000 area, which we would now begin to think of as an affordable housing range, there does seem to be something of a shortage. So if you have any data on that that you could share with us, I would appreciate it. Because as we formulate the stimulus package, Mr. Chairman, this is something I think we ought to look at. It is a little more sophisticated and has drilled down through the data to a more granular level. But anything we can do to get the construction business started--you say, well, it is maybe too long term out, but there are a lot of jobs that people can get in the construction business if they are building the lower-priced houses that right now the construction workers do not have anything to do.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, one thing that is certainly true is that a lot of the big house price declines are taking place in high-priced areas like California and Florida, Nevada, Arizona, where prices went up a lot before, and now they are coming back down.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","That is the price range that it is hitting in Utah as well. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Not at all. And I might have missed this in your point here, but seemingly one of the issues we are grappling with here is the oversupply. And you are raising a different question. Where is that oversupply occurring? But one of the concerns I have is that allowing the market to take over here, if your supply increases and demand is not keeping pace, then obviously your ability for the market to really help stabilize this problem here is going to be de minimis, it seems to me.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","My point is that the market is not monolithic. There is an oversupply at the high range, but I am being told that in the lower range----",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, that is a good question and one we ought to--if you have the ability to give us some information on that, I would be very interested in that as well, Mr. Chairman. Let me turn to Senator Menendez.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Thank you. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your testimony and your service. It seems to me--and I am sure all of us--that the central bank is faced increasingly with the contradictory pressures of the slowing economy and rising consumer prices-- gas prices, food prices, energy prices as a whole, to name a few. Isn't revving up a slow economy far easier than slowing inflation once it has become entrenched?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","As you say, if it becomes entrenched, if inflation expectations were to rise and that were to lead to a wage-price spiral, for example, or, non-energy, non-food prices rising more quickly, that would be more of a concern. As I said, we are concerned. I do not wish to convey in any way that we are not concerned about it. We are trying to balance a number of different risks against each other. With respect to inflation, as I said, our anticipation is that inflation will come down this year and be close to price stability this year and next year. If it does not, then what we will be watching particularly carefully is whether or not inflation expectations or non-energy, non-food prices are beginning to show evidence of entrenchment, of higher inflation, as you point out. That would certainly be of significant concern to us and one that we are watching very carefully.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Let me ask you, with consumers reluctant to spend and businesses reluctant to invest and lenders reluctant to lend and home prices going downwards, is the lower interest rates, do you believe, going to be enough to do the trick?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I think it is certainly helpful, and we also have a fiscal package, as you know. A lot is going to depend on the underlying resilience of the economy itself and of the financial system to work through these problems and to bring us back to a situation where we can grow in a normal way.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","How about something that you do not have control over, which is the foreign confidence in the American dollar? Isn't your ability to continue to cut rates to some degree restrained by the willingness of foreign countries to continue to finance the current account deficit?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it is a complex question. We----",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Can you give me a simple answer?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I will try. It is important for the U.S. economy to be strong and an attractive place for investment. And I think we are better off in the medium term trying to ensure good, strong growth in the economy to attract foreign investment than we are falling behind and allowing the economy to drop into a severe decline. So there is a balance there. We have to think about the short-term return, which is partly related to our interest rate decisions, but we also need to think about the medium term, where we want to make sure the economy is growing in a stable and healthy way which will attract foreign investment. Foreign investment, I should emphasize, continues to be strong. We are not seeing any significant shifts of out of dollars among official holders, for example. And I anticipate that we will continue to have the capital inflows we need, in part, going back to my earlier comments, because I do think that the world recognizes that the U.S. economy has underlying strengths and resilience that will bring us back to a strong growth path within the next couple of years.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","If then the Fed's decision at this point in time--of course, it always depends upon the point in time-- is that dealing with the slowing economy is the present priority, and as the Chairman has said on more than one occasion, that if there is a great challenge in the economy, it stems from the mortgage meltdown, the housing market meltdown, are we--I have a real concern. You know, in March of last year, I and a few others said we are going to have a foreclosure tsunami, and everybody pooh-poohed that and said that is an overexaggeration. And, unfortunately, we are well on our way, and we have not even seen the totality of it. The question is, when I see the Center for Responsible Lending say that basically the present administration's plans will only deal with 3 percent of the properties, removing them from foreclosure, and I see Moody's saying that the experience of 2007 is largely around 3.5 percent of workout, at the end of the day is a 97-percent market correction something that we are willing to accept and something that we need to accept? Or is that a percentage that is far too high?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, there have been about four or five studies reviewing the experience of servicers and lenders and trying to work out mortgages, and, unfortunately, we are still getting a very mixed and fuzzy picture about exactly what is happening. One of the benefits, I think, of some of the recent actions associated with the Hope Now Alliance, for example, is that I hope we will be getting better, more up-to-date, and more consistent data on what is actually happening in the field. I do agree that while the servicers seem to have made some progress in scaling up their activities, they are not yet to the point where they can deal with what you called the ``tsunami of foreclosures,'' which is already well underway. And for that reason, we continue to urge them to expand their efforts further, to work toward more permanent solutions.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","But if that were to be the figure, is that an acceptable market correction figure, 97 percent of the couple of million families in this country ready to lose their home? Is that what we are willing to accept, both in the context of public policy as well as in the context of our economy?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, even under regular circumstances, unlike what we have today, the number of foreclosure starts that actually ends in an eviction or a sale is well less than 97 percent. So I am not quite sure what to compare it to. Obviously, the more people who are able and desire to stay in their home, the more we can help, the better that is going to be. And I strongly support increased efforts by the servicers and lenders to address this issue.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Well, my concern is we were behind the curve in trying to deal with the issue, and my concern is now we seem to be continuing behind the curve in stemming the hemorrhaging that is going on. One last question. The central bank has always seen its core mission as safety and soundness. Consumer protection I hope is going to increasingly be something that you will consider a core mission as well. And I heard your remarks at the very end of your testimony. Is it your intention--when you talk about issuing something on unfair and deceptive practices, is that in relation to credit cards, mortgages, to REITs? Is it cross-cutting?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","We have already issued the HOEPA rules, which address unfair, deceptive acts and practices relating to mortgages, for comment. We are currently receiving comments on those. The new rules, which I alluded to, for the spring are under the FTC unfair, deceptive acts and practices code, and they would apply to credit cards, and possibly other things, but primarily credit cards.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech,

"Senator Allard","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you,",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke"," Mr. Chairman, we have to, I think, remind ourselves exactly what is involved in a recession. I hear the reporters, I think erroneously, reporting a recession when actually we are having an economic slowdown. I would like to have you define for the Committee what would constitute a recession.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, recessions are generally called, so to speak, by a committee called the Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is part of the National Bureau of Economic Research--a committee of which I was once a member, by the way--which looks at a wide variety of indicators to see essentially if the economy contracted over a period of time. It is a somewhat subjective decision, and it is often made well after the fact because of the revisions of data and so on. A more informal but widely used definition of recession is two consecutive quarters of negative growth. That would be an alternative that people use.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","There was a newspaper article or report that came out, I think in the last day or two, suggesting that somehow or other the Federal--or you and the Fed may be running out of tools to control inflation. Do you have a comment on that comment?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, as I said, we are trying to use our principal tool, which is the Federal funds rate, to balance the various risks that we see in inflation and growth and financial stability. We do not really have additional tools on inflation. We do have additional tools to deal with financial problems, such as, the term auction facility, which we are currently using, and other steps that we have taken or could take. With respect to inflation, I think our principal tool would be the interest rate.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Now, the Congress, through public policy, I think on a macro scale, may have some impact on the economy. And in general terms, if the Congress was to increase spending, what do you feel would--what kind of an impact would that have on the economy? And then look at the other side. Suppose Congress would increase taxes. What kind of an impact would that have perhaps on today's economy where we are standing?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, from a short-term aggregate demand viewpoint, spending tends to add to demand, and if the economy is at a point where its resources are not being fully utilized, it could lead to more increased utilization of resources; whereas, higher taxes in a short period of time, if it reduces consumer spending, for example, could lead to less use of resources. The Congress has passed a fiscal stimulus package which tries to address the issues of aggregate demand and sufficient demand for utilization of resources. I would urge the Congress, in looking at additional spending and tax plans, to think about the underlying effects on the efficiency and effectiveness of the economy, that is, not to make decisions based on short-term demand considerations but to think about how these spending programs or tax programs affect how well the economy will grow over the long term.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","So you are thinking about Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid primarily on those costs, I would assume?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, and from a fiscal perspective in the longer term--and by longer term, I means only a few years from now because we are coming very close to the point where the baby-boom generation is going to begin to retire in large number. By far, the biggest issue is entitlements, particularly the Medicare part, but Social Security as well.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Yes, I appreciate those comments. The other thing, you talk about, you know, inflation being pushed by energy and food costs. What is offsetting that? There must be some--to come out with an average of 2 percent, a little over 2 percent, there must be somewhere over here where we are getting a lesser amount that is offsetting those increases. Where do you see that happening?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, what we saw in 2007 was about 2-percent inflation excluding energy and food. When you add on the energy and food, you get something more like 3.5 percent by our preferred indicator, which is obviously a high rate of inflation and we are not comfortable with.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","So you do not see a sector of the economy that is being driven down in a way that it has an offsetting effect. You are just seeing this just averaging out as a part of the average. OK. We have on ethanol, for example, on energy, we have a really high tariff. It is 51, 52 percent. And energy builds into the whole economy. It is a fundamental driver. What do you think about us looking at reducing some of those high tariffs like that? What kind of an impact would that have on our economy?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, as you know, I favor open trade, and I think that allowing Brazilian ethanol, for example, would reduce cost in the United States.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","And is that--when you look at the food--the way I look at it is when you have an ethanol--you have your food products being diverted to ethanol production, it has an impact on both food as well as the cost of energy and whatnot. Is it a significant enough part of the economy that we need to look at that more seriously?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I do not have an estimate of the overall effect. I think it would be hard to do. But it is the case that a significant portion of the corn crop is now being diverted to ethanol, which raises corn prices. And there are some knock-on effects; for example, some soybean acreage has been moved to corn production, which probably has some effects on soybean prices, too. So there is some price effect on foodstuffs coming through the conversion to energy use.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Well, you know, the wheat farmers in my State are saying that wheat is at a historic high for them, and so I wonder just, you know, how much of that--I suppose, again, that is a dryland crop, but there is some conversion to dryland corn. But, again, that seems to have some impact on the grains in general, and the poultry people and the livestock people-- well, all livestock people--swine, poultry, and beef in particular--all have concerns about that. So I was curious to see how you were evaluating that policy in respect to the total economy, and obviously you do not have too much to say on that because you do not think it is too big a part of the economy. Is that right?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, again, I do not know quantitatively how big the effect is, but there is some inflationary pressure coming through foods, including corn and soybeans, and obviously other crops like wheat which have suffered various supply problems in the last year.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Yes, OK. Well, Mr. Chairman, I see my time has run out.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Great questions, too, and we will come back to those maybe in a little bit. Senator Reed was raising with me privately the issue as well, and I think it is worth exploring. The issue of the question of the value of the dollar, the rising price of oil, the dollar denomination oil pricing, whether or not that can shift in these commodities generally is an interesting issue. But let me turn to Senator Bayh.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bernanke, thank you for you--Chairman Bernanke, I should say. Thank you for your presence today, and thank you for your service to our country. I think you have your priorities right. You mentioned that the risks in the forecast are to the downside and that our principal concern at this moment--you have to strike a balance, but our principal concern should be avoiding an economic downturn of severity and duration while continuing to focus on inflation in the longer term. As you and some of my colleagues have pointed out, the genesis of much of this originated in the housing sector, particularly with some of the subprime type mortgages. And it seems to me that you, in setting monetary policy, erred on the side of--not erred, but you have been more aggressive than less and tried to minimize the downside risk to the economy. And that is as it should be. My question to you is: Should not Congress do the same in addressing the housing problem? The President has the voluntary Hope Now initiative you have outlined. I think it would be charitable to say that the results of that have been modest to date. You indicate there is not a lot of data, but it certainly does not seem as if it has had much of an impact. There are some proposals, fairly narrowly circumscribed ones before us, that would focus on this issue, allowing bankruptcy courts, only with regard to outstanding subprime mortgages, to revisit some of these issues, only when the borrowers have passed a strict means test. The interest rates would be set at prime plus a risk premium, and if the homes were ever resold, the lenders would participate in the upside, any potential upside, if the property would revalue. Now, the President has threatened to veto this initiative, and some have claimed that it would add as much as 2 percent to the cost of a mortgage. I find that to be not a credible analysis when it, by definition, does not apply to future mortgages. This is a one-off event, the greatest housing downturn in the last 50 years, fairly narrowly circumscribed. So my question to you is: Just as you have emphasized being more aggressive at this moment, should not we? And as an economist, is it credible to think that this would add 2 percent to the cost of a mortgage moving forward in this narrowly circumscribed manner?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I do not know how much it would add. I think it would probably add something because the collateral would be less secure.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","This only applies to past loans, by definition, not future ones.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, then the question is raised: Will this happen again?",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Well, every 50 years when we have a calamity like this, maybe so.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","You know, I see concerns on both sides of this, and I understand the rationale for wanting to make those changes. I also see some concerns about the effects on the marketplace and, for example, on holders of current loans, how they would react.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","There are some implicit risks in the more aggressive monetary policy you have pursued.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Monetary policy is my domain, and I----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","My point is and the question I am raising, just as you have been more aggressive--and appropriately so-- should not we?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I think there is an argument for being aggressive in general, but I would just decline, if you would permit me, to endorse that particular action. I am really at this point focused on FHA and GSE reform as being two useful steps in the direction of helping the housing market. And we should continue to think about alternatives. But at this point I do not have, good additional measures to suggest to you.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Well, I do not want to put you in the business of getting into the debate between the legislative and executive branches here, but I do think at this moment, as we have all recognized, this is a perilous moment for the economy. It seems to me that there are risks on either side, but the balance here, it seems to me, lies on being a little more aggressive than less. And that ought to apply to all aspects of our policy, not just one particular subset. We have had a big discussion here about inflation versus growth. Again, I think you have your priorities right in that regard. You have pointed out that the core rate, while modestly above target, has--the principal thing driving this in the near term has been food and energy costs, and that you do not see any persistent rise in the core over the longer term. My question, Mr. Chairman, is: What indicia of economic stability or greater growth would alleviate your concerns and would allow you to then perhaps pivot and focus on the inflation concern more than we currently are?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, first, I do not want to leave the impression that we are looking only at one----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","No, no. You were very balanced.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","We are always trying to balance these risks and always trying to continually re-weight our thinking about the different risks to the economy.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Maybe a better way to put my question would be: When will the risks be back in equilibrium as opposed to-- what indicia will you look at to reassure yourselves that the economy is stabilized and growth is resumed at an acceptable level?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","One of the concerns that I have is that there is some interaction between the credit market situation and the growth situation--that is, if the economy slows considerably, which reduces credit quality, that worsens potentially the condition of credit markets, which then may tighten credit further in a somewhat adverse feedback loop, if you will. I think that is an undesirable situation. I would feel much more comfortable if the credit markets were operating more nearly normally and if we saw forecasted growth--not necessarily current growth but forecasted growth--that looked like it was moving closer toward a more normal level. So what I would like to see essentially is a reduction in the downside risks which I have talked about, particularly the risk that a worsening economy will make the credit market situation worse.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Well, let me ask you--but I have got only 1 minute so I am going to need to hurry. I did have two questions. What aspect of the credit markets will you look to? And, in particular, I have been interested--you talked about the flight from risk. There have been some aspects of the credit market that seem to me to be almost without risk, and yet people are fleeing from those as well. These auction rate securities, very short term, the underlying assets, particularly in the municipal sector, virtually no risk of default, and yet that seems to have seized up as well. What do you think will lead people to begin to assume rational levels of risk again? And what indicia will you look to in the credit markets to reassure yourself that this situation is beginning to work itself through?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, there is reluctance to take risk, and there are also concerns about understanding exactly what a particular financial asset consists of. And there are still some issues of transparency and so on that need to be worked out. I think that a stable situation would be one in which good quality credits like, major municipal borrowers would not have difficulty in getting credit, and the issue would be the same for good quality credits of firms and households as well. So when you see a pulling back, and seeing the problem spread through a variety of markets, which is interfering with the normal flow of credit, then obviously that is not a normal, healthy situation.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Mr. Chairman, I have just one--my final question. Mr. Chairman, it has been visited by a couple of my colleagues; particularly Senator Reed I thought was excellent in his questioning. It has to do with the credit agencies. We had a couple of very capable individuals come before our caucus to focus on some of these economic concerns, and the issue of the rating agencies came up. And one of them, in response to my question about--markets can operate efficiently, but that presumes they have access to accurate information. In this case, you know, clearly that was not always so. And this is the problem with the credit markets in part you have pointed out here. So what can we do to avoid this again? You have mentioned that you and your people are looking at that. But when I asked the question, this individual said, ``Well, I am not sure any additional action by the Government is necessary. The market will work this out. These rating agencies, their share prices will be punished and, therefore, they will have an incentive to not do this again.'' But whether it is in regard to certain types of Latin American credit or other areas, it seems that the markets have a way of forgetting the lessons of history, focusing on short- term decision making, every 7, 8, 10 years or so, and we kind of end up in some of these problems again. And the consequences to the broader economy here have been so profound and so great, it seems to me, that in addition to relying on the market, perhaps there should be some parameters to ensure that we do not end up in this situation again, which leads us to either regulatory or legislative action. So, just broadly speaking, do you think that some additional actions, either regulatory or legislative, may be in order to ensure that this situation does not repeat itself in the future and that we do not just simply rely upon the punishment of the market to prevent this in the future?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, regulatory action is already being contemplated. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which has authority over the credit rating agencies, is reviewing the situation, and seeing whether additional steps need to be taken. Of course, the Congress already gave the SEC some powers, which they have begun to implement. The fault lies on both sides of the equation, if you will-- with the credit rates, but also with the investors, who over- relied on those ratings and did not do sufficient due diligence. In that respect, as I mentioned before, the Basel Committee is looking at the use of ratings in risk measurement for banks, and I would encourage the regulators of pension funds and other investors, for example, to ensure that investors do due diligence over and above simply looking at the rating and assuming that is all you need to know.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very, very much. Again, some very, very good questions.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My opening statement I will submit for the record.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","By the way, I should have made that point. All opening statements and any supporting documents people want to have will all be included in the record, and I appreciate you raising that.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Chairman Bernanke, can you explain what information or event caused the Fed to change its view on the conditions of the economy and the financial markets and led to the January 21 intermeeting rate cuts?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes, Senator. First of all, as you know, we cut rates by about 100 basis points during the fall, reacting to the drag on the economy arising from the housing markets and from the credit market situation. Around the turn of the year and early in January, the data took a significant turn for the worse, and it seemed clear that the economy was slowing, and slowing more than anticipated, and that the credit market condition situation was continuing. On January 9, I called a meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee by video conference to discuss the situation. It was agreed by the committee that some substantial additional cuts in the Federal funds rate were likely to be necessary. The thought at the time of that meeting was that it might be worth waiting until the regular meeting at the end of the month where we could have a fuller discussion and see the revised forecast and so on, taking into account the possibility that we could also move intermeeting, if necessary. On January 10, I gave a speech where I informed the public that I thought that substantive additional action might well be necessary, thereby signaling that the conditions had changed and that further rate cuts were likely to happen. In the days that followed that speech, the tone of the data deteriorated considerably further, which made me think that the outlook was, in fact, much weaker and the risks were greater. That was showing up both in the data and in the financial markets. We were seeing sharp declines in equity prices. We were seeing widening of spreads. And we were also seeing, again, adverse data. On January 21, I became concerned that the continued deterioration of financial markets was signaling a loss of confidence in the economy, and I felt the Fed, instead of waiting until the meeting, really needed to get ahead of that and take action. So I called an FOMC conference call, and we agreed at that point to cut the Federal funds rate target by 75 basis points. There was an understanding at that meeting that further additional action was very likely to be needed, but we felt that we could wait another 10 days until the regular meeting to determine exactly how much additional action. At the meeting at the end of January, we had a full review, discussion, forecast round and so on and determined that an additional 50 points was justified. Looking back, as the data have evolved, I think that the 125 basis points was appropriate for the change in the tone of the economy, and I think it was the right thing to do.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Are the days of constant and gradual Fed rate changes over? In other words, are large and intermeeting rate changes going to become a regular part of the Fed toolbox now?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I cannot make any guarantees, Senator, but in general, we prefer to move at the regularly scheduled meetings. As I said, that is a chance to get together in Washington and to have a full briefing by the staff and to have all the information made available to us.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","How about which do you see as a greater threat to the economy, a credit crunch now or higher inflation in the future as a result of efforts to stop a credit crunch?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, we have to keep balancing those things. As I said, our current view is that inflation will moderate this year as oil and food prices do not rise as much this year as they did last year. We are also watching very carefully to make sure that higher oil and food prices do not feed into other costs and into other prices or that inflation expectations do not become unanchored. If those developments began to happen, that would certainly force us to pay very serious attention. At the moment, I think the greater risks are to the downside--that is, to growth and to the financial markets; but, again, we are always vigilant on all of our objectives and are always trying to balance those risks against each other.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","You read the Wall Street Journal. I am very sure of that. Today, in the Wall Street Journal, ``Report on profits a bright spot in the gloom. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 6 percentage points since the first day of the year.'' In the Standard & Poor's index, 462 corporations have reported their earnings for the fourth quarter; 62 percent of those that have reported topped their earnings estimates--62 percent. If you drop out financials, carve out financials, which were 12 percent lower, the gloom and doom that I have heard here today is not gloom and doom. Are you going to tell me that these same corporations that reported--and we had a really low growth rate in the fourth quarter--are going to be worse in the first quarter? Or are we also going to have the same kind of reporting in the first quarter of 2008 that this profit report on the Standard & Poor's and the Dow is not as accurate in the first quarter as it was in the fourth?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, you are absolutely correct that profits at the nonfinancial firms have remained pretty good. I do not have with me an estimate of the profits for the first quarter. But firms seem to be indicating concerns about the future. For example, if you look at the ISM survey of non- manufacturing industries, it dropped very significantly a few weeks ago, suggesting a good bit more pessimism on the part of firms.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","But isn't one of the real signals that we really have to watch the unemployment rate in the United States of America? And that moved from 4.9 to 5 percent in the fourth quarter. And where is it now? Where do you estimate it to go in the first quarter of 2008?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","It jumped in December from 4.7 to 5.0, which is a pretty significant jump, and it was certainly something that we looked at. And----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, that was kind of indicated by the low growth rate and the reasonable expectation that the job rate would be higher, unemployment in the fourth quarter. I am asking about 2008.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I reported our projections for the fourth quarter, which were 5.2 to 5.3 percent in the fourth quarter. We are seeing unemployment insurance claims rising, which I think is consistent with the somewhat higher unemployment rate going forward.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","What are you telling me?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","That the unemployment rate is likely to go up from here.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","How bad? Are you saying 5.6, 5.7?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","The baseline projection we have made for the fourth quarter is 5.2 to 5.3, but there are downside risks. Things could get worse than that. We do not know. But it is not our main projection. It is just a risk that we see out there.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Then does that bode well with the lowering of interest rates and the higher rate of unemployment? That indicates to me that someone in the Journal today that talked about stagflation might be talking more sense than we might anticipate.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, again, Senator, we are just trying to balance the risk of growth, inflation, and financial stability. Monetary policy works with a lag, and, therefore, we have to--",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, I understand that very clearly. We should have lowered rates earlier, and all of a sudden we lowered them 2.25 points--225 basis points in less than-- what?--6 weeks, 8 weeks.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","It was 125.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","125.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Yes, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, if you count the fourth quarter of last year, what was the total?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","We lowered 50 basis points in September, 25 in October, 25 in December, and 125 in January.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Then it was 225.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Not in the fourth quarter.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","No, no. Total. Total since the last----",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","That is right.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is considerable, and the market conditions indicated that that was absolutely necessary.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I think so. The housing market decline and the weakness in the credit markets were suggestive of----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Well, the weakness in the credit markets, Chairman Bernanke, were signaled last year, early in the year. I mean, it was not--it did not take a rocket scientist to figure that out. And I know with all the great economists that you have on the Federal Reserve and your members of the Federal Open Market Committee are a lot sharper than the people sitting up here at this table. And you had a big heads-up signal that the housing market was in the tank early last year.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","But the housing market was not affecting the broad economy. When we lowered interest rates on the last day of October, that morning we received a GDP report for the third quarter of 3.9 percent, which was subsequently revised to 4.9 percent, and inflation was a problem. So, in fact, I think if we look back on this episode, we will see that the Fed lowered interest rates faster and more proactively in this episode probably than any other previous episode. As you point out, the unemployment rate is still below 5 percent, and----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I lived through the Greenspan years. I know exactly what you are talking about. Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thanks very much.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Mr. Chairman, with your and the Committee's permission, Senator Tester has to be somewhere at noon and so do I, so I volunteered to split my time with him and let him ask the first question and leave, and then I will-- if that is OK with you and the rest of the Committee.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Fine.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","Thank you, Senator Schumer, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairman Bernanke. I appreciate your forthrightness today and always. I want to talk about commodities for a little bit. I am a farmer. I am happy when commodities go up. But as was earlier pointed out today, oftentimes this can end up potentially like it was in the 1970s when we saw a big commodity raise; we saw the inputs that went into agriculture go through the roof; we saw food prices on the shelf go up because commodity prices were higher; and then commodity prices fell back. Those inputs that went into production agriculture stayed up, and the food on the shelf stayed up, too, because they said there was not enough wheat in a loaf of bread to make a difference after they raised the prices because commodities went up. My question to you is: Do you see that playing out the same way? I mean, we are going to see food prices go up probably, it would be my guess. We already have. And we have already seen inputs go up on the farm for production agriculture. I anticipate this commodity price will not stay where it is at forever. They usually do adjust, and they usually adjust down. And food prices will stay up, inputs will stay up. Do you see that same thing happening again? And is there anything we can do if it is that way?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","If commodity prices come down, including energy prices and raw food prices, I would expect to see, perhaps with a lag, finished food prices come down as well. As we have been discussing, the commodity prices, both food and energy, have been the primary source of the recent inflation. If they stabilize, even if they remain high, then inflation will moderate. And I expect that would happen, at least over time, at the finished level as well as at the raw level.",Speech,
"Senator Tester","OK. Thank you very much, and I want to thank Senator Schumer again. Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","My pleasure. Two questions, Mr. Chairman. The first involves these sort of combination, creating problems now, of marking to market and the credit crunch, freeze, call it what you will. You know, when I first got here on the Banking Committee, banks really did not mark to market, and we regarded it as great progress that they now have to mark to market, like securities firms and others always did. It is a proper valuation of their assets. The problem here is nobody knows how to mark to market because there is no market. In too many areas, no one is buying. And so you do not know what they do when they make a valuation. I have heard from many people that that valuation is--they make it artificially low, and that further exacerbates. It is a vicious cycle because then they do not have the capital, they cannot do any more lending, and everything is frozen up. Is there a way to deal with that problem now? Is there a way to say, yes, you have to mark to market, but in these unusual circumstances you can do it 6 months from now, or something to that effect, quarterly, yearly? I am not an expert here, but I do know it is a real problem. How do you mark to market when there is no market? And because there is no market, rare, almost never occurred in such large parts of the credit market before, is this an unusual circumstance where this does not work? And my second question--and I will ask you to answer both-- is this: The worry I think people have--and we have seen some questions on this--is that it is a lot easier to get the economy going than to shut inflation off. And the worry is that we go back to the situation in the late 1970s where the economy was stalling, rates were lowered, and then there was nothing that the Fed could do other than very late and drastic action to curb inflation. It was a difficult struggle. We went through it in the 1980s, and I remember paying 21 percent on my mortgage when I first signed my mortgage in 1982. Do we have better tools now that can control, you know, if inflation should start going beyond what you imagine for all the--we are global economy. You have less experience and less tests in this interconnected world than you did 20 years ago. Do we have better tools? Are you worried that if inflation really starts chugging along, that even a quick raise in interest rates will not be able really to head it off without really severe damage to the economy? So those are my two questions.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Thank you, Senator. On the first one, you raise a very good point. The Federal Reserve has long had sort of a mixed view about fair-value accounting. We think that market-traded assets should be valued at the market price and that investors are entitled to know what that price is. But we have always recognized--and we had in mind things like bank loans, for example, that are relatively illiquid--that it might be difficult to value them on a fair-value basis and that there could be problems arising there. As you point out, we now have a situation where some assets which are normally tradable are perhaps not generally tradable. The accounting profession has created a system which, attempts to get around that problem. There are these three different levels where you have a market valuation or a model valuation or a judgment valuation. I think that is one of the major problems that we have in the current environment. I do not know how to fix it. I do not know what to do about it. I think the accountants need to make the best judgment they can.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Some have suggested, you know, delaying a mark to market, even using this system until there is a market and letting the--because you really do not know the value of the asset. And if you undervalue it, you may be hurting things as much as if you overvalue it.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I understand your concern, Senator, but the risk on the other side is that if you do too much forbearance or delay mark to market, that the suspicion will arise among investors that you are hiding something.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Right. What about a rolling average that takes into account 6 months back?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I have not worked through any proposals like that. This is really an Accounting Board responsibility. I agree there is a severe problem. It is difficult to change the rules in the middle of a crisis.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","I know.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","It is one of those things that we are going to have to put on the list of issues to evaluate as we try to learn the lessons from this experience.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","But you do admit it is a serious--it is one of the nubs of the problem now, even though it has not been talked about that much.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","And the direction of how to fix it is not at all clear.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","OK. Second question.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","On your second concern, I think we are better off now than we were in the 1970s in that there is a much broader recognition of the importance of price stability and greater confidence that central banks will deliver price stability. The indicia of inflation expectations, where some of them have moved a bit, are basically stable. We have not seen any major shift in views about inflation and where inflation is likely to go. The Federal Reserve has emphasized the importance of maintaining price stability and has indicated that we will watch very carefully and make sure that we do not see any deterioration in either broad measures of inflation expectations or increased pass-through of food and energy prices into other prices. We will watch those carefully and we will respond----",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","But do you believe if you miscalculate and inflation starts coming out of the box more quickly than you think, do you have tools to deal with that or is that still a very difficult area, once inflation rears its head, it is very hard to put the genie back in the bottle? Or are we much better at it now than we were 20 years ago?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, if higher inflation were to become well embedded in inflation expectations and wages and other parts of the economy, it would be difficult, and we do not really have new methods. It is a risk, and we take it very seriously, and we are monitoring it very closely. But as I have said several times, we are dealing with a number of different concerns here, and we are trying----",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","I know. It is not easy.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","----the risks as best we can.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank my colleagues.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Well, thank you very much, Senator, very much.",Speech,
"Senator Dole","",Speech,
"Senator Dole","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, I do not have to tell you that my State of North Carolina has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs over recent years, and you and I have had discussions about job retraining programs. I am very pleased that Congress has now begun to debate the best way to reform the Trade Adjustment Assistance, the TAA Program. And I would like to ask your opinion about what you feel the impact would be of congressional reauthorization and if there are any particular aspects of reform that you would want to suggest for the workforce of the 21st century.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, as I have argued in a number of speeches, for example, globalization and trade have a lot of benefits, but they also have some costs. They cause dislocation. They cause loss of jobs. And my view is that the best way to deal with that problem is not to shut down trade but, rather, to help those who are affected adjust to their circumstances.",Speech,
"Senator Dole","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","And so as a general matter, we should look for ways to help people through skill acquisition or other kinds of assistance that allow them to take advantage of the new opportunities to replace the ones that they lost. I do not want to comment on specific elements. I know there are some competing TAA bills being considered, and I think that is really up to Congress to make those detailed decisions. But I do think that it is much better than shutting down trade to try to help people adjust to the effects of trade. I had the opportunity recently to speak in Charlotte, and one of my themes there was although North Carolina certainly has lost a lot of manufacturing jobs, if you look at the city of Charlotte and how it has reinvented itself to become a financial center, a services center and a center for the arts and many other things, there is a tremendous opportunity in a dynamic economy, as the one we have, to find new opportunities, to find new businesses and industries. And so rather than try to freeze the industrial structure the way it is, we are better off helping people move to the new opportunities, and TAA is one potential way of trying to assist that process.",Speech,
"Senator Dole","Thank you. Mr. Chairman, let me ask you about Sarbanes-Oxley. Some smaller banks appear to be clearly overburdened by compliance with Sections 404 and 302. These financial institutions are already highly regulated, and it has become increasingly apparent that these regulations, while they were well intended, only increased the cost of doing business. I would really appreciate your comments on what needs to be done here.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it has been recognized that Section 404, in particular, imposes a lot of costs. It does have some benefits and helps improve internal controls. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB have recently issued an audit standard which tries to take a more balanced, risk- focused approach to enforcement of 404. And I hope as a general matter that that will reduce the costs while preserving the benefits of Sarbanes-Oxley. In the case of banks in particular, there is a good bit of overlap, obviously, already with some of the rules that they have to follow under existing bank regulations. And I think it would be useful to consider where there are redundancies or overlaps that could be reduced in the future.",Speech,
"Senator Dole","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Over recent months, much has been written in the financial press regarding whether or not key worldwide central bankers--the Bank of England, Bank of Japan, European Central Bank, and the United States, et cetera--should become more coordinated in their monetary policy efforts. Proponents of such efforts point to the current spread between various key country lending rates. What is your reaction to this debate?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, Senator, first of all, the major central banks do cooperate on many things. We meet quite often. I see my colleagues at international meetings here and in other countries very frequently. We are on the phone together, and we try to keep each other apprised of what is happening in our own economies and in the global economy, what we are planning, what we are thinking. We have worked together on some measures recently. In December, when we introduced the term auction facility, we did that in a coordinated way with the ECB, the Swiss National Bank, the Bank of England, and the Bank of Canada--who also undertook various liquidity options at that time. So there is a lot of coordination and cooperation in that respect. With respect to monetary policy per se, although we keep each other apprised, each economy is in a different place, in a different situation, and there is no necessity that each country has to have the same policy. I think the policy that is chosen depends on the particular circumstances of that country or that region. And so that is one of the benefits of having flexible exchange rates to provide some insulation, some ability for countries to run independent monetary policies. And so it has been our practice, as you know, for each major central bank to run an independent monetary policy, and while we keep each other apprised, I do not expect to see any extensive coordination in the near future.",Speech,
"Senator Dole","Thank you very much. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","",Speech,
"Senator Corker","Mr. Chairman, thank you, and I thank you for your testimony. I listened carefully to what you had to say because I know you choose your words carefully. You need to because everybody in the world is listening to what you have to say. But I did notice that, you know, you mentioned that in every other sector of our economy, we are doing well except in the financial area. And I noticed that you have mentioned not to make--we shouldn't make decisions for the short term, that as it related to the housing issue itself, that you knew of no good additional measures, that you are focused on GSE reform and FHA reform. And I know the Senator from Indiana talked about on our side being aggressive. I would say that what we do ends up being a law that cannot be changed. What you do can be changed at the very next meeting, and so you have a great deal more flexibility to really look at indicators and make changes than we do. Our changes usually stay there for a long time. I was up at the New York Stock Exchange last week and noticed that they are trying to put in place the ability for people to know quickly what the value of their credit instruments are, that there is not the transparency there that we have in the equity markets. And my sense is because there is no transparency today, that even if we did not have the subprime issue, because people are making money packaging things and selling them off to the next person, that even if the subprime market had not tanked the way that it had, we still would have had writedowns because people were making so much money off of fees. Is that a fair assessment?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I think the subprime crisis sort of triggered these events. But it is true that investors have lost confidence in a lot of different assets at this point, including, it was mentioned, some student loans and other things as well. And part of the problem--not all of the problem, but part of the problem--is that in these complex structured credit products, it is very difficult for the investor to know exactly what is in there and what derivative support or credit liquidity support is involved.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","So, in essence, the subprime issue that has occurred has caused us to look at those in a more healthy way, and hopefully the market will create some mechanisms for us to actually value those in real time and create a way for us to have some transparency there. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I hope so. But, again, as Senator Schumer suggested, if the accounting industry or the regulators can be of help there, I think we ought to try to be of assistance.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","You mentioned that leverage was at all-time lows in other sectors, and, you know, I still am shocked that when we had a credit problem, it was our wisdom to sprinkle money around America in an America that already had an incredibly low savings rate and ask them to spend it as quickly as possible. And I get concerned about actions that we might take here that, in essence--I know you mentioned at the last meeting several times the word ``correction.'' I know Chairman Dodd somewhat chastised me at the end because I was pressing for an answer. But do you still believe that--and he did so in a very amicable way. I appreciate that. But, in fact, do we have a crisis right now in housing, or do we have a correction? The reason I ask, I look at delinquencies over 30 days. Everything is over 30 days, all the way through foreclosure. And even though I know we are having some extreme issues in some of the higher-cost housing, it really is not very much different than it has been over the last 30 years, only about a percent and a half different as far as delinquencies go. Is this a correction or is this a crisis as it relates to housing itself?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I do not know what terms to use. The housing market certainly has come down quite a bit, down to less than half the amount of construction that we had a couple years ago. Prices are falling. Foreclosures are up probably this year about 50 to 75 percent over last year. So, you know, there are certainly some major things going on in the housing market, and they have created some problems in the credit markets and the rest of the economy as well.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","Is this the kind of thing, though, that the market can take care of itself? You know, you do not seem to have any other ideas legislatively that we might come forward with to deal with this problem. Is this something the market itself can deal with?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, the first line of defense for dealing particularly with foreclosures is to have servicers and lenders work with the borrowers to try to restructure their mortgages or otherwise find a solution. And the Treasury, the Fed and other regulators and the Congress certainly have encouraged the private sector to ramp up their efforts as much as possible to try to deal with as many people as possible, because there certainly is a significant increase in the number of troubled borrowers. I have suggested other things--and things that this Congress has undertaken, like FHA modernization and GSE reform--that could be helpful in bringing the housing market back.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","And, obviously, we have two instruments-- either monetary policy or fiscal policy. You are dealing with the monetary side. I guess on our side we deal with the fiscal. What I am taking away from what you are saying--a very intelligent person who certainly has a much broader view of what is happening not only here but also in the world--is that you know of nothing today, you have no additional ideas legislatively or fiscally for us to deal with other than GSE reform and FHA reform. You know of nothing else today other than the existing efforts by the marketplace itself to work out some issues between lenders and borrowers. You know of nothing else today that we might do constructively to solve this problem.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Senator, I see no harm in trying to think about other alternatives, and there are things that have been suggested. But at this point, I am not prepared to support any additional----",Speech,
"Senator Corker","I am all for us thinking. I am a little worried there is a package that is actually coming to the floor, and that moves something into law. But I just appreciate your testimony, and I want to say that just in general I do think that sometimes when issues occur here, our hair gets on fire to act in ways that I think can actually create other problems down the road. And my sense is that what you are saying is we are doing the things that we know to do today that make sense. And I hope that what you are also saying is that before we take any other action, we will think about those fully and look at the long-term implications of the market, not just trying to deal with something in the short term. I think that is what--thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator, and I appreciate that, and I appreciate the Chairman's response to your questions as well. And as he points out, and I pointed out, back a year ago we--in fact, I feel very strongly that the best line of defense is exactly what the Chairman has said, and that is, hopefully the servicers and others can work out things here so that you do not have to engage in extraordinary steps to try and minimize these problems. And that is the first line of defense, and we are very hopeful that will produce some results. I also just want to point out quickly to my good friend from Tennessee here, Residential Fixed Investment, the GDP component that includes spending on housing, plunged by 25.2 percent in the fourth quarter, a bigger drop than the earlier 23.9 percent; third quarter spending fell by 20.5 percent. To give you some sense of proportionality, that is the worst plunge since the fourth quarter of 1981. This is a larger issue than just a correction problem. I say that respectfully, but I think it is bigger than that is the case.",Speech,
"Senator Corker","If I could respond to that, I would say, too, that is coming off of an extreme high. I mean, we have had an exuberance in the housing market, and I think we should measure those drops off of a mean, if you will, versus a high. I think that the housing industry has enjoyed extreme free credit for many, many years. We have had an exuberant market that we have known for some time--as a matter of fact, I would say that actually a few years ago we were concerned in California, for instance, that housing prices were going up so rapidly. And so I would say that that drop is off an extreme high, and I thank you for pointing that out to me.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Let me, if I can, Mr. Chairman, I want to raise a couple of questions, if I can for you, and some of them have been touched on. I do not want to take a long time here with you, but I am just intrigued by the correlation of some of these issues. Sometimes we cite a bunch of statistics and wonder what the correlations are between them. There are two factors that I want your thoughts on, if I can, that contribute to this huge run-up in commodity prices that we heard Senator Tester talk about and others. Oil is the first thing I think about, but obviously, if you are a farmer or a baker in Rhode Island, it can be the cost of wheat and others. The first is the increase in the demand for these goods. That is obviously one set of issues. The second is that these goods are priced in dollar terms. Sometimes we pass over that idea, but we talked about the price of oil a barrel, it is in dollar terms. And to what extent is the decline in the value of the dollar driving this? And beyond that concern, is that decline in the dollar--does that decline represent a decrease in confidence in the U.S. financial system? As the Fed report indicates--and I mentioned this at the outset--there was a net sale of U.S. securities by private foreign investors in the third quarter of 2007, the first quarterly net sale in more than 15 years. And I wonder how is that loss of confidence in the U.S. by foreign investors leading into a decline in the dollar, which leads to the rising commodity prices. I am trying to connect these questions, if at all. I was talking to a friend of mine in Europe this morning who is involved in the financial services sector--a totally different matter--and I told him I was going to be having the hearing this morning with you. And he was saying that one of the problems we have got is the fact that Europe is not cutting its interest rates at all, and so you are getting that comparison as well, which probably exacerbates this problem to some extent, at least in that market. And I was curious, because we have had a lot of questions of you--and I will come back to this in a minute--on the sovereign wealth funds, and I was trying to get some sense of proportionality about private investment versus sovereign wealth funds. And I do not minimize the importance of the sovereign wealth funds issues, but I asked staff to give me some sense of the proportionality of numbers. And out of the estimated $150 trillion in global capital stock, $2.2 trillion is held by sovereign wealth funds. And while sovereign wealth funds are about double the size of hedge fund assets, they represent less than 5 percent of global assets. And while China's sovereign wealth fund hold is about $200 billion in assets, the size of China's foreign exchange reserves is about $1.3 trillion. And so you have got--putting aside that for a second, the private investment sector here is an important one, and maybe I--am I making too much of this bar graph I saw in the Monetary Report Fund where you see for the first time that looks like a selling off here? And I noticed in your response to one of the--I forget who it was raised the question earlier. At least I thought I heard you say this was not as--that foreign investment is still coming in and that is a source of some confidence here. Anyway, could you try and connect those things for me? Is it a false connection? But I am curious how that relates to the decline in the dollar, the rise in commodity prices, and whether or not there is some connection here.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I do not think that foreign investors have lost confidence in the United States by any means. The data you are referring to shows some desire by foreign investors to shift out of corporate credits and other credit products and into treasuries. That is the same shift that American investors are making. They are getting away from what they view as risky credits toward the safety of U.S. Government debt. And, indeed, U.S. Government debt is still the safest, most liquid, desired asset in the world. There is some effect of the dollar on commodities. Oil and other commodities are traded globally. You can think of the price as being set by global supply and demand. If the dollar depreciates a bit, then you would expect to see commodity prices rise to offset that depreciation. But it is important to understand that, for example, oil has risen in euros as well as in dollars. I mean, it is not simply an issue of currencies. It also has to do with global supply and demand for the commodity. So the European Central Bank is concerned about food and energy inflation as well. With respect to the sovereign wealth funds, that is just another indication that foreigners have not lost confidence in the U.S. economy and that there has been a good bit of inflow. In particular, about something close to half of the capital that financial institutions have raised in the last few months has come from sovereign wealth funds, from other countries. I think that, in general, that is quite constructive. If we are confident, as I think we are in this case, that the investments are made for economic reasons and not for political reasons or other noneconomic reasons, and there is no issue of national defense, which the CFIUS process takes care of, then that inflow of investment is good for our economy and certainly is helping, in this case, the financial system. At the same time, allowing inflows of foreign capital through reciprocity gives us more opportunities to invest abroad. I know that Congress is very interested in sovereign wealth funds, and you should certainly take a close look at it. International agencies, like the International Monetary Fund and the OECD, are developing codes of conduct. The basic idea there is that sovereign wealth funds should be as transparent as possible. We should understand their governance and their motivations, and, in particular, we should be confident that they are investing, again, for economic rather than political or other purposes. If we are confident in that, then it is in our interest to keep our borders open and to allow that capital to flow in. And I think it will continue to flow in.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","You raise a good point here and one I wanted to raise with you. This is a statement you made yesterday as well before the House Financial Services Committee, talking about it. And I do not disagree. It is quite constructive. And I think there has to be a sense of balance in how we look at sovereign wealth funds, and I think we run the danger of becoming a pejorative without understanding the value of it. So we have to be careful about it. And you pointed out, and you did again here just now, you mentioned CFIUS, which, of course, we developed good legislation, I think, out of the Committee on that, the IMF, the OECD, and looking at these investments from their various perspectives in terms of these issues, which are a very legitimate point. But what is the Fed's role in a sense? I mean, this is, it seems to me, while all these other institutions have an important role to play, I would make a case here that the Fed also has an important role. They are investing in bank holding companies. This is the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve Board, and it seems to me you did not mention the Federal Reserve's obligation to be looking at these questions as well. And, obviously, we have had major investments here in bank holding companies. So tell me what you think is--what is the Fed doing about this, and what is the responsibility of the Fed in looking at this issue as well?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","You are quite correct, Senator. I should have mentioned that. Well, first, of course, we are very involved with the banks themselves, and we are very interested in their capital-raising efforts and making sure that they raise enough capital to meet the well-capitalized standards and to remain safe and sound. And so that whole process is something we pay very close attention to. We have statutory responsibilities. If the investment by any single person or group, whether it is a sovereign wealth fund or someone else, reaches certain levels that, imply a significant degree of control, then we have to look at that, make sure it is appropriate.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Is that a sort of objective test rather than a subjective test?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I believe that 25 percent is the threshold.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","But I was looking and thinking--I am just curious to get your reaction to this. And, again, I do not want to overdramatize this point, but I was curious in one of these--and you will know which one I am talking about. One of these major investment houses, when the decision was made as to who the new CEO was going to be, there was a flight I think occurred that went to a country that was making major investment to get the OK in a sense. Now, the amount invested would represent an amount far smaller than the 25-percent threshold. But clearly, at least, if you will, the visuals of going over and getting sort of a sign-off indicated that there was more of an influence than the dollar amount would indicate. I mean, does that trigger something? Or should it trigger something?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, I think if the investor is making that big an investment, they need to understand what is going on. I am not sure whether it was a case of their deciding who was the CEO or just simply being informed of the plans of the company. In the cases that we have seen, the investments have been significant in absolute terms, but small in percentage of equity terms. And in most cases, the amount of control--rights, board of directors, membership and so on--has been quite limited. So there has not been any significant change in the control of these institutions. If there were, then the Federal Reserve would want to----",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","No, absolutely. I understand that. And, again, I am not trying to expand your portfolio here by suggesting an earlier intervention, but it would seem to me that there may be some signals here that may fall short of the 25 percent. I would rather have you taking a look at those things where--and come to me and say, ``I think this is''--not to me necessarily, but to say we think we ought to take a look at this, it may fall short of that absolute trigger. That is why I say objective/subjective kind of analysis as to what this could mean, so look at that. Is there any chance, any worry you have at all--coming back to the first question I raised with you, the declining value of the dollar, the 24-percent decline, the lowest since 1973, compared to the six other major currencies. Is there any chance in your mind that we would watch something moving away from a dollar denomination in these areas, in these commodities, such as oil going to the euro, for instance? Do you see any danger in that? Or is it--do you worry about that at all?",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","I know of no plans of that, but the denomination, as I said, is of second-order importance. There is some importance in the willingness of foreigners to hold dollar assets, which is a different matter entirely. And as I said, I know of no evidence that there is any reduction in interest.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Would that concern you if that happened? I mean, is there----",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","If there was a change in denomination?",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Yes, if they moved all of a sudden, went from the price of a barrel of oil measured not in dollars but in euros, what does that say about us and our economy? Does that have--I mean, it seems to me that would be rather a dramatic piece of news.",Speech,
"Mr. Bernanke","Well, it might be symbolic. It might have symbolic value. But from an economic point of view, it is a global market, and foreign currencies are traded all the time. You know, if I want to buy a barrel of oil, I can do it in euro or yen or any other way I like. So from a fundamental sense point of view, it is not significant. There might be some symbolic value to it if that happened.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","I was going to ask you a question to follow up on Senator Menendez who asked questions about the housing issue. But I think your answers in response to Senator Corker were good ones in thinking about this issue. And I sense in your comments here today that this housing issue is a serious one. And I am not going to try and put words in your mouth again, but I realize you put an adjective on this, and that becomes the headline. But it is serious and warrants serious thought as to what we can do to minimize this and to try and keep people in their homes, minimize this from happening again, and dealing with related issues. And I appreciate those comments. And we are going to continue talking with you about these various ideas that we have. And I certainly appreciate, having been here long enough to know, that sometimes actions, however well intended, can have unintended consequences, and so you need to think through things carefully. And so we are going to want to be in touch with you during that process. But we also want to make sure we are not looking back and wondering if we could have done some things here that would have minimized this from getting worse. So it is important. I will leave the record open for a couple of days here. Members who did not make it here may have some additional questions for you. You have been before this Committee a lot now in the last couple of weeks, and we are grateful to you for that, and we will continue working with you. The Committee will stand adjourned.",Speech,
