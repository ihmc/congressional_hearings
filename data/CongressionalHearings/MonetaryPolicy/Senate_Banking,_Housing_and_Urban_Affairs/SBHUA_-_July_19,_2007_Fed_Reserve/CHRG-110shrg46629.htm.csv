"Chairman Dodd","The hearing will come to order. The Committee is very pleased this morning to welcome the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke. We thank you for being with us to present your outlook for the Nation's economy, the Fed's conduct of monetary policy, and the status of important consumer protection regulations that are under the Federal Reserve's jurisdiction. Mr. Chairman, we once again welcome you to the Senate Banking Committee. Before I begin my opening statement, I wanted to recognize several special guests we have with us here this morning, Dick, the members of the European Parliament's Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs led by Chairwoman Pervenche Beres, and we thank you very much, Madam Chairwoman, for being here, and your colleagues as well. We are honored to have you here at the Senate Banking Committee and to have you participate. The Chairwoman mentioned to me that the last time you came here and visited us was at the last testimony of Chairman Greenspan. So this is kind of a beginning again, so we start with the first testimony here of Mr. Bernanke. So welcome and thank you for joining us here. This hearing is being conducted pursuant to the statute and according to practice. It is an occasion to consider not just monetary policy in a narrow or limit sense but also the overall health of our economy and what the Fed, as an agency, and we, as policymakers, should do to increase prosperity and opportunity in our country. The role of the Fed is critical not just to setting monetary policy but it also serves as a regulator for the safety and soundness of the largest lending institutions, and very significantly, as a regulator and enforcer of the laws passed by the Congress to protect consumers and ensure that they have an opportunity to participate and succeed in the American economy. Mr. Chairman, I know I do not need to tell you that the Fed stands at the center of some of the most critical economic and public policy matters of our time. In the 17 months as Fed Chairman, your steadiness at the helm of our Nation's monetary policy seems to have earned you the confidence of the markets, which is the initial step toward a successful tenure as Fed Chairman. And I congratulate you on that. The confidence has been reflected, in part, by some of the positive economic news that we have experienced, including an official unemployment rate that is low by historical standards, by gains in the stock market, and the economy's overall stability in the face of serious problems in both the housing and automotive sectors of our economy. Those positive factors aside, and notwithstanding the positive impact of your leadership, there are some facts that are cause for deep concern for many of us here about our Nation's economic future, in particular the future of tens of millions of hard-working Americans. Despite some increases in income, working families are facing some unprecedented economic burdens. Gas prices reached another record high of an average of almost $3.25 a gallon across the country this past Memorial Day weekend. Health care costs have increased by 25 percent over the last 5 years. And the cost of sending a young person to college has risen at more than double the rate of inflation over the past 20 years. And default and foreclosure rates, as you well know, for homeowners are an all-time high. Mr. Chairman, there is a persistent if not growing sense among many of our fellow countrymen that their future is less secure and less hopeful today than it has been and should be. It is in that respect that the Fed's role comes into play not just as a monetary policymaker but also as a safety and soundness regulator and as an agency charged with protecting consumers. The Fed can and, in my view, should take additional steps that can make a real difference in improving our overall economic growth as well as an opportunity for all Americans to contribute and to participate in the success and prosperity of the economy. In that regard, let me say that I am pleased that you, as chairman, have accepted the Fed's duty to act under the Home Ownership Equity Protection Act. I consider this a significant statement by you and I trust and expect that it will result in significant action by the Fed to ensure that every American who seeks to buy a home will receive a fair, reasonable, and responsible treatment by his or her lender. Similarly, with respect to credit cards, I commend the Fed for undertaking the effort to update Regulation Z which in my view is long overdue. It is vital that consumers have the clearest and most complete information possible about credit cards so they can make the most informed decision about how to use them. However, improved disclosure is not, in and of itself, sufficient to address abusive practices. I believe the Fed can and should play a more active role not just in improving disclosure for consumers but also in prohibiting policies and practices that are harmful to consumers. In my view, credit cards can and should be a tool for economic achievement and advancement rather than an instrument of perpetual indebtedness. Last, Mr. Chairman, let me raise the issue of Basel II, of the bank capital standards, with you. History has taught us that well-capitalized banks are in the best interest of our Nation when they are better positioned to weather unexpected economic shocks, thereby protecting American taxpayers from costly bank bailouts. And they enhance the competitiveness of U.S. banks by instilling confidence in the strength of these vital institutions. As Senator Shelby and I have written to you and your fellow banking regulators, the stakes are very high for our economy in this debate. We believe that it is imperative that the four regulatory agencies together agree upon the standards that will strike the vital balance between the remarkable safety and soundness of our federally insured lending institutions and their competitiveness in the global economy. Mr. Chairman, the challenges you face, of course, are daunting. I think I speak for all of our Committee Members here in saying that we are committed to seeing the Fed succeed at each of these three vital missions: As a center of monetary policy, a consumer protector, and a bank regulator. What is at stake here is not just the success of your agency, obviously, and your tenure as Fed Chairman, as important as those are, but rather the success of our entire economy and in particular for the tens of millions of Americans whose hard work is the foundation of our economy's success and who deserve every opportunity to maximize the fruits of their labor. With that, let me turn to my colleague from Alabama, the Ranking Member of the Committee, Senator Shelby.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. Chairman Bernanke, we are pleased again to have you before this Committee. This hearing, as Senator Dodd has pointed out, provides the Congress a very important opportunity to have an open and detailed discussion about the Fed's monetary policy goals and their implementation. I also expect that Members of the Committee here, including myself, will take advantage of your appearance, Mr. Chairman, to raise some other issues that fall under the jurisdiction of the Federal Reserve. I would also like to join Senator Dodd in welcoming our colleagues from the European Union Parliament that are here today. I had a nice meeting with them yesterday and we look forward to these transatlantic visits. I think they are healthy. I trust that your visit here today will be enlightening and provide you with much to discuss with the European Central Bank. Chairman Bernanke, your testimony and report this morning note the continued healthy performance of the economy in the first half of 2000. Although real gross domestic product, GDP, increased 0.7 percent in the first quarter the consensus view among economists is that growth for the second quarter will show a rebound in the neighborhood of 2.5 percent. Along with continued GDP growth, we have seen positive news on the job front. Gains in the payroll employment average 140,000 jobs per month in the first half of 2007. We continue to enjoy low unemployment rate in this country, both historically and relative to other industrialized nations in the world. The global economy also continues to be strong with Canada, Europe, Japan, and the United Kingdom experiencing above trend growth rates in the first quarter. This is good news, I believe, for American businesses seeking to expand their exports around the world. In its statement following the June 28, 2007, meeting the FOMC suggested that while core inflation readings had moderated ``sustained moderation in inflation pressures has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.'' There is a lot in those words. Inflation risks, not slow growth, remains the predominant concern as we continue to see a rise in energy and food prices. I also share, Mr. Chairman, your view on the importance of low inflation in promoting growth, efficiency, and stability which in turn equal maximum sustainable employment. Chairman Bernanke, your statement also includes an extensive discussion of the Federal Reserve's recent activities relating to subprime mortgage lending, which is a concern to all of us. The recent sharp increases in subprime mortgage loan delinquencies are troubling. The rating agency's recent moves are also very interesting too. The initiatives that you highlight in your testimony are welcome. However, I am concerned that the weaknesses, Mr. Chairman, in the subprime market may have broader systemic consequences than we are seeing yet. We have been told that the problem is largely isolated and contained but I am concerned that that may not be the case. I will be particularly interested in hearing your views on the scope and depth of the problem and how the Federal Reserve will monitor and manage the situation hopefully going forward. We are pleased to have you with us this morning, as I said, and we look forward to the rest of the hearing and my colleagues testimony.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator. Let me inform my colleagues that as soon as a quorum appears here, I am going to interrupt the hearing. I say that to you, Mr. Chairman, as well, respectfully. We have several nominees that are prepared to be confirmed by this body and I would like to be able to move on that the moment a quorum arrives here. So just to give you advance notice when that happens here, realizing people have other obligations and may be moving in and out here. So we will try to get that done. If for whatever reason we do not, then I will be asking all of you to join me after the first vote or during the first vote sometime around noon off the floor of the Senate to try to get these matters moved along so they can be considered by the full Senate before our August adjournment. With that, let me turn to Senator Brown.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And Chairman Bernanke, thank you very much for joining us this morning. I am particularly pleased that your testimony describes Congress as prescient in the trend toward transparency. It is not often you see the words Congress and prescient in the same sentence. Thank you for that. Of course, you are referring to an action 30 years ago, but we will take what we can get. As you know, we need to encourage transparency in both central banking and in financial services and particularly in the mortgage business. I appreciate your devoting much of your testimony in the work of the Federal Reserve in promoting better disclosure for mortgage borrowers and hope you and your colleagues will approach this task with great urgency. As you know, the loans of close to 2 million subprime borrowers will reset in the next 2 years. Every day of inaction means another 2,000 to 3,000 mortgages will reset without sufficient protections. If they are lucky, many of these families will be able to take out another lousy mortgage. If they are unlucky, they may lose their life savings. The Federal Reserve must act and must act quickly both to mitigate the damage that has already been done and to prevent a continuation of the abusive practices and products that have characterized too much of the mortgage industry over the past few years. I understand why a lender needs to price for risk but I do not understand why the structure of mortgage products is so different in the prime and subprime markets. Most of the people in this room do not have a prepayment penalty on their mortgage. Most of us have our property taxes and our hazardous insurance escrowed. By contrast, the loans in the subprime sector, like the 228s, seem almost designed to deceive. They are sold to borrowers with teaser rates and with dangerous features and with the smooth pitch that there is no need to worry about the reset because good things might happen in your life, a better job, a better loan, even winning the lottery. But betting on the outcome is not a sound banking practice. It is possible that I will play like Grady Sizemore in next year's Congressional baseball game but the Indians would be well advised not to put him on waivers. Sadly, it is not very likely I will climb the fence to rob somebody of a home run next summer because Republicans just do not have that kind of power. You obviously need to take a broad view in your position. But the very dispersion of risk that makes the subprime problem less of a worry from an economic standpoint makes it a greater problem for homeowners trying to work out an unaffordable loan. We all know it makes economic sense for a lender to mitigate losses but just try getting the right person on the phone in a timely fashion, especially if the owner of the loan sits in Shanghai. One man's junk is another man's treasure. What may look like BBB debt to an investor on Wall Street is really the hopes and dreams of thousands of families in Slavic Village in Cleveland and across the country. Those hopes and dreams diminish with every day that we delay. So, I would urge you to take action quickly and comprehensively. You need to bring an end to the deceptive practices in the subprime sector, not just for banks and their affiliates but for all mortgage brokers and all types of lenders. Thank you. I look forward to your testimony.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR SHERROD BROWN
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Hagel","Mr. Chairman, welcome. I will withhold my comments until the question and answer period. I just want to say that we are glad you are here with us today. Thank you.",Statement,COMMENTS OF SENATOR CHUCK HAGEL
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","I will not exercise such statesmanlike restraint. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Chairman Bernanke, for joining us today to discuss the state of monetary policy and its reflection on our economy. At the past eight meetings of the FOMC, the Fed has held the Federal Fund rates steady at 5.25 percent. However, significant turmoil in the housing market particularly related to subprime mortgages, a growing trade deficit, and a negative household savings rate continue to pose tremendous challenges to setting monetary policy. I know, Mr. Chairman, you have personally expressed concern about core inflation being higher than is desirable in the long run. But the risk of raising interest rates too high is that a weakening housing sector and rising oil prices may be taking their toll on consumers and businesses alike and slowing down the economy too much already. I look forward to your insights about the kind of policies that are likely to be effective in addressing the challenges we face in this economy and offering real opportunities for growth that provide widespread benefits to the American people. On a systemic level, the weakening housing sector and turmoil in the subprime mortgage market have placed pressure on both investors and borrowers. Bear Stearns has recently announced that two of its hedge funds are now worth nearly nothing after some of its investments in subprime mortgages went bad. Last week both Moody's and Standard & Poor's significantly downgraded ratings on hundreds of subprime related bonds. The ABX Index, which tracks the performance of various classes of subprime related bonds hit new lows yesterday. In the past few months portions of the index that tracked especially risky mortgage bonds with junk grade ratings have been falling. And this is now spread into the portion of the index that track bonds with ratings of AAA or AA. According to Merrill Lynch's latest fund manager survey which polled 186 fund managers controlling $618 billion in assets, 72 percent of managers said that credit or default risk was the biggest threat to financial market stability. I would appreciate hearing your thoughts on some of these events, particularly as they may pertain to the financial accelerator effect you spoke of in Georgia last month and the efforts of the Federal Reserve to monitor some of these risks. Finally, the Federal Reserve has the authority and responsibility to prohibit unfair and deception lending practices. As such, Mr. Chairman, I was pleased to hear that the Fed will likely propose additional rules under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, HOEPA, to provide consumers with better protections through bans on some mortgage purchases. Additionally, I understand that the Fed will join other regulators in a pilot project to monitor the practices of nondepository subprime mortgage firms. I am interested in your perspective on what additional actions the Federal Reserve will be taking to meet the regulatory portion of its mandate. I look forward to your testimony, Mr. Chairman. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Reed.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, it is always good to welcome a fellow New Jerseyan back to the Committee. I am glad to have the chance to have you before the Committee again this year. I think your presence here is especially important, not just because it gives Congress an opportunity to look critically at the economy to see what is working and what is not, but because it brings a discussion of the economy onto the front pages and into the homes of Americans across the country. I think Americans from all walks of life are clearly affected when the market has a dip, by external pressure on prices, by poor investment. For many, these factors are invisible. I welcome these discussions with you because you help make them much more tangible for average people across the country. And I assume you often ask yourself a question that I certainly do, and I believe all of us should be asking, and that is who is this economy working for? Who is this economy working for? Most middle-class Americans face rising food and energy prices as well as health care costs while median incomes for the last 5 years have remained stagnant. I think that there is a good part of the American middle class who does not think that this economy is working for them. Unfortunately, most are aware of changes in the economy when it affects them negatively. I would like to focus on a specific group of Americans who have been keenly aware of how the economy has not worked for them, those who dreamed of being homeowners but in the wake of the subprime tsunami have seen those dreams wash away in foreclosure and bankruptcy. More than one million Americans lost their homes last year and few have yet to recover. In fact, I would dare to argue that another storm is on its way as adjustable rate mortgages explode in coming months and force more homeowners into foreclosure. And so in my mind this is not just simply a time for suggestions, it is a time for solutions. The Federal Reserve has, and has always had, the tools to protect Americans from this storm. But as the warning signs were posted and as the foreclosures began we saw little to no action. Now I want to commend you for addressing this issue, especially on low document loans and underwriting to the full indexed rate. But I am still hoping for more substantive solutions that will protect the borrower. We are talking also about predatory lenders and we must take swift action. I do not believe this is one that the market is going to handle simply on its own. Congress and the Federal Reserve need to act and I look forward to discussing this more with you today. I welcome the focus you have recently had on discussing certain inequalities in our economy and I will look forward to your thoughts on these and other issues important to the economic prosperity of our Nation. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to thank you for holding this hearing and I want to thank Chairman Bernanke. As Chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, I am always interested in hearing your thoughts on the current state of economy and appreciate your availability on so many issues when we reach out to you. As I have said in the past, we live in interesting economic times. And you face a number of important challenges in setting a course for monetary policy that will achieve the multiple goals of high employment, balanced economic growth, and low inflation. Right now, there are certain reasons to be concerned about where we find ourselves. In the short-term, even with the likely improvements in the second quarter, overall economic growth in the first half of the year has been disappointing to say the least. Most forecasters have revised downward their expectations for economic growth through the rest of the year. The Administration continues to run high budget deficit that threaten our future stability to compete with the rest of the world. And our trade gap, particularly with China, remains immense and growing at a rapid rate. Energy prices are hovering at record highs, feeding our trade gap and fueling anxiety among middle-class families. The collapse of parts of the housing market which you call a correction has become a serious drag on our economic growth and a threat to economic security of too many American families. And while I welcome the Fed's new pilot program to monitor independent subprime brokers, I do not think consumers will truly be safe from irresponsible and deceptive lending practices until we enact tougher Federal laws to protect the subprime mess from happening again. As indication of the weakness in the housing market continue to mount, there is an urgent need for better protections for existing and aspiring homeowners, although I do want to thank--the Appropriations Committee did a $100 million in for the workouts. So nonprofits can do workouts that Senators Casey, Brown, and I had asked them to do. Most importantly, a view is recognized. We have an economy whose rewards seems to be more and more going to fewer and fewer privileged Americans. We are facing the greatest concentration of income since 1928 right before the crash and the beginning of the Depression when 24 percent of all income went to the richest 1 percent. It is now close to 22 percent and will pass the 24 percent, if present trends continue, all too soon. At a time when the wealthiest in this country have been doing extremely well, the American middle class, the engine of our economy, has not been as fortunate. Most Americans have not seen the benefits of working harder in their paychecks. Between 2000 and 2006 the typical worker's earnings grew less than 1 percent after accounting for inflation while productivity increased a whopping 18 percent. And now that economic growth seems to be slowing, its fair to ask whether most middle-class Americans will slip even further behind. The dramatic increase in productivity and its failure to raise wage rates is a great conundrum for our economy that needs all of our attention. I do not pretend that there are easy solutions to the troubling challenges facing our economy but we need to remember that our collective focus must be on achieving strong sustainable long-term economic growth that can be shared by all families in this country, not just those in the top 1 or 5 percent. Unless economic fortunes in this country grew together rather than apart, we cannot be confident about our children's economic futures. I look forward to your testimony, and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the time.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR CHARLES E. SCHUMER
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator, very much. Mr. Chairman, we welcome you here to the Committee once again and we are prepared to receive your statement.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you. Chairman Dodd, Ranking Member Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. As you know, this occasion marks the 30th year of semiannual testimony on the economy and monetary policy by the Federal Reserve. And in establishing these hearings, the Congress proved prescient in anticipating the worldwide trend toward greater transparency and accountability of central banks in the making of monetary policy. Over the years, these testimonies and the associated reports have proved an invaluable vehicle for the Federal Reserve's communication with the public about monetary policy even as they have served to enhance the Federal Reserve's accountability for achieving that dual objectives of maximum employment and price stability set forth by the Congress. I take this opportunity to reiterate the Federal Reserve's strong support of the dual mandate. In pursuing maximum employment and price stability, monetary policy makes its greatest possible contribution to the general economic welfare. Let me now review the current economic situation and the outlook beginning with developments in the real economy and the situation regarding inflation before turning to monetary policy. I will conclude with comments on issues related to lending to households and to consumer protection, topics not normally addressed in monetary policy testimony but, in light of recent developments, deserving of our attention today. After having run at an above trend rate earlier in the current economic recovery, U.S. economic growth has proceeded during the past year at a pace more consistent with sustainable expansion. Despite the downshift in growth, the demand for labor has remained solid, with more than 850,000 jobs having been added to payrolls thus far in 2007 and the unemployment rate having remained at 4.5 percent. The combination of moderate gains in output and solid advances in employment implies that recent increases in labor productivity have been modest by the standards of the past decade. The cooling of productivity growth in recent quarters is likely the result of cyclical or other temporary factors but the underlying pace of productivity gains may also have slowed somewhat. To a considerable degree, the slower pace of economic growth in recent quarters reflects the ongoing adjustment in the housing sector. Over the past year, home sales and construction have slowed substantially and house prices have decelerated. Although a leveling off of home sales in the second half of 2006 suggested some tentative stabilization of housing demand, sales have softened further this year, leading the number of unsold new homes in builders' inventories to rise further relative to the pace of new home sales. Accordingly, construction of new homes has sunk further, with starts of new single-family houses thus far this year running 10 percent below the pace of the second half of last year. The pace of home sales seems likely to remain sluggish for a time partly as a result of some tightening in lending standards and the recent increase in mortgage interest rates. Sales should ultimately be supported by growth in income and employment as well as by mortgage rates that--despite the recent increase--remain fairly low relative to historical norms. However, even if demand stabilizes as we expect, the pace of construction will probably fall somewhat further as builders work down stocks of unsold new homes. Thus, declines in residential construction will likely continue to weigh on economic growth over coming quarters, although the magnitude of the drag on growth should diminish over time. Real consumption expenditures appear to have slowed last quarter, following two quarters of rapid expansion. Consumption outlays are likely to continue growing at a moderate pace aided by a strong labor market. Employment should continue to expand, though possibly at a somewhat slower pace than in recent years, as a result of the recent moderation in the growth of output and ongoing demographic shifts that are expected to lead to a gradual decline in labor force participation. Real compensation appears to have risen over the past year and, barring further sharp increases in consumer energy costs, it should rise further as labor demand remains strong and productivity increases. In the business sector, investment in equipment and software showed a modest gain in the first quarter. A similar outcome is likely for the second quarter as weakness in the volatile transportation equipment category appears to have been offset by solid gains in other categories. Investment in nonresidential structures, after slowing sharply late last year, seems to have grown fairly vigorously in the first half of 2007. Like consumption spending, business fixed investment overall seems poised to rise at a moderate pace bolstered by gains in sales and generally favorable financial conditions. Late last year and early this year motor vehicle manufacturers and firms in several other industries found themselves with elevated inventories, which led them to reduce production to better align inventories with sales. Excess inventories now appear to have been substantially eliminated and should not prove a further restraint on growth. The global economy continues to be strong. Supported by solid economic growth abroad U.S. exports should expand further in coming quarters. Nonetheless our trade deficit, which was about 5.25 percent of nominal gross domestic product in the first quarter is likely to remain high. For the most part, financial markets have remained supportive of economic growth. However, conditions in the subprime mortgage sector have deteriorated significantly, reflecting mounting delinquency rates on adjustable-rate loans. In recent weeks, we have also seen increased concerns among investors about credit risk on some other types of financial instruments. Credit spreads on lower quality corporate debt have widened somewhat, and terms for some leveraged business loans have tightened. Even after their recent rise, however, credit spreads remain near the low end of their historical ranges and financing activity in the bond and business loan markets has remained fairly brisk. Overall, the U.S. economy appears likely to expand at a moderate pace over the second half of 2007, with growth then strengthening a bit in 2008 to a rate close to the economy's underlying trend. Such an assessment was made around the time of the June meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee by the members of the Board of Governors and the Presidents of the Reserve Banks, all of whom participate in deliberations on monetary policy. The central tendency of the growth forecasts, which are conditioned on the assumption of appropriate monetary policy, is for real GDP to expand roughly 2.25 to 2.5 percent this year and 2.5 to 2.75 percent in 2008. The forecasted performance for this year is about one- quarter percentage point below that projected in February, the difference being largely the result of weaker than expected residential construction activity this year. The unemployment rate is anticipated to edge up to between 4.5 and 4.75 percent over the balance of this year and about 4.75 percent in 2008, a trajectory about the same as the one expected in February. I turn now to the inflation situation. Sizable increases in food and energy prices have boosted overall inflation and eroded real incomes in recent months, both unwelcome developments. As measured by changes in the price index for personal consumption expenditures, PCE inflation, inflation ran at an annual rate of 4.4 percent over the first 5 months of this year, a rate that if maintained would clearly be inconsistent with the objective of price stability. Because monetary policy works with a lag, however, policymakers must focus on the economic outlook. Food and energy prices tend be quite volatile so that, looking forward, core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, may be a better gauge than overall inflation of underlying inflation trends. Core inflation has moderated slightly over the past few months with core PCE inflation coming in at an annual rate of about 2 percent so far this year. Although the most recent readings on core inflation have been favorable, month-to-month movements in inflation are subject to considerable noise and some of the recent improvement could also be the result of transitory influences. However, with long-term inflation expectations contained, futures prices suggesting that investors expect energy and other commodity prices to flatten out, and pressures in both labor and product markets likely to ease modestly, core inflation should edge a bit lower on net over the remainder of this year and next year. The central tendency of FOMC participants forecast for core PCE inflation--2 to 2.25 percent for all of 2007 and 1.75 to 2 percent in 2008--is unchanged from February. If energy prices level off as currently anticipated, overall inflation should slow to a pace close to that of core inflation in coming quarters. At each of its four meeting so far this year, the FOMC maintained its target for the Federal funds rate at 5.25 percent, judging that the existing stance of policy was likely to be consistent with growth running near trend and inflation staying on a moderating path. As always, in determining the appropriate stance of policy, we will be alert to the possibility that the economy is not evolving in the way we currently judge to be the most likely. One risk to the outlook is that the ongoing housing correction might prove larger than anticipated, with possible spillovers onto consumer spending. Alternatively consumer spending, which has advanced relatively vigorously on balance in recent quarters, might expand more quickly than expected. In that case, economic growth could rebound to a pace above its trend. With the level of resource utilization already elevated, the resulting pressures in labor and product markets could lead to increased inflation over time. Yet another risk is that energy and commodity prices could continue to rise sharply, leading to further increases in headline inflation and, if those costs pass through to the prices of nonenergy goods and services, to higher core inflation as well. Moreover, if inflation were to move higher for an extended period and increase became embedded in longer-term inflation expectations, the reestablishment of price stability would become more difficult and costly to achieve. With the level of resource utilization relatively high and with a sustained moderation in inflation pressures yet to be convincingly demonstrated, the FOMC has consistently stated that upside risks to inflation are its predominant policy concern. In addition to its dual mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the Federal Reserve has an important responsibility to help protect consumers in financial services transactions. For nearly 40 years, the Federal Reserve has been active in implementing, interpreting, and enforcing consumer protection laws. I would like to discuss with you this morning some of our recent initiatives and actions, particularly those related to subprime mortgage lending. Promoting access to credit and to homeownership are important objectives and responsible subprime mortgage can help to advance both goals. In designing regulations, policymakers should seek to preserve those benefits. That said, the recent rapid expansion of the subprime market was clearly accompanied by deterioration in underwriting standards, and in some cases by abusive lending practices and outright fraud. In addition, some households took on mortgage obligations they could not meet, perhaps in some cases because they did not fully understand the terms. Financial losses have subsequently induced lenders to tighten their underwriting standards. Nevertheless, rising delinquencies and foreclosures are creating personal, economic, and social distress for many homeowners and communities, problems that will likely get worse before they get better. The Federal Reserve is responding to these difficulties at both the national and the local levels. In coordination with the other Federal supervisory agencies we are encouraging the financial industry to work with borrowers to arrange prudent loan modifications to avoid unnecessary foreclosures. Federal Reserve Banks around the country are cooperating with community and industry groups that work directly with borrowers having trouble meeting their mortgage obligations. We continue to work with organizations that provide counseling about mortgage product to current and potential homeowners. We are also meeting with market participants--including lenders, investors, servicers, and community groups--to discuss their concerns and to gain information about market development. We are conducting a top to bottom review of possible actions we might take to help prevent recurrence of these problems. First, we are committed to providing more effective disclosures to help consumers defend against improper lending. Three years ago, the Board began a comprehensive review of Regulation Z, which implements the Truth in Lending Act, or TILA. The initial focus of our review was on disclosures related to credit cards and other revolving credit accounts. After conducting extensive consumer testing, we issued a proposal in May that would require credit card issuers to provide clearer and easier to understand disclosures to consumers. In particular, the new disclosures would highlight applicable rates and fees, particularly penalties that might be imposed. The proposed rules would also require card issuers to provide 45 days advance notice of a rate increase or any other change in account terms so that consumers will not be surprised by unexpected charges and will have time to explore alternatives. We are now engaged in a similar review of the TILA rules for mortgage loans. We began this review last year by holding four public hearings across the country, during which we gathered information on the adequacy of disclosures for mortgages, particularly for nontraditional, traditional, and adjustable rate products. As we did with credit card lending, we will conduct extensive consumer testing of proposed disclosures. Because the process of designing and testing disclosures involves many trial runs, especially given today's diverse and sometimes complex credit products, it may take some time to complete our review and propose new disclosures. However, some other actions can be implemented more quickly. By the end of the year, we will propose changes to TILA rules to address concerns about mortgage loan advertisements and solicitations they may be incomplete or misleading and to require lenders to provide mortgage disclosures more quickly so that consumers can get the information they need when it is most useful to them. We already have improved a disclosure that creditors must provide to every applicant for an adjustable rate mortgage product to explain that better the features and risks of these products such as ``payment shock'' and rising loan balances. We are certainly aware, however, that disclosure alone may not be sufficient to protect consumers. Accordingly, we plan to exercise our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act, HOEPA, to address specific practices that are unfair or deceptive. We held a public hearing on June 14 to discuss industry practices including those pertaining to prepayment penalties, the use of escrow accounts for taxes and insurance, stated income and low documentation lending, and the evaluation of a borrower's ability to repay. The discussion and ideas we heard were extremely useful and we look forward to receiving additional public comments in coming weeks. Based on the information we are gathering, I expect the Board will propose additional rules under HOEPA later this year. In coordination with the other Federal supervisory agencies, last year we issued principles-based guidance for nontraditional mortgages, and in June of this year we issued supervisory guidance on subprime lending. These statements emphasized the fundamental consumer protection principles of sound underwriting and effective disclosures. In addition, we reviewed our policies related to the examination of nonbank subsidiaries of bank and financial holding companies for compliance with consumer protection laws and guidance. As a result of that review and following discussions of the Office of Thrift Supervision, the Federal Trade Commission, and State regulators as represented by the Conference of State Bank Supervisors and the American Association of Residential Mortgage Regulators, we are launching a cooperative pilot aimed at expanding consumer protection compliance reviews at selected nondepository lenders with significant subprime mortgage operations. The reviews will begin in the fourth quarter of this year and will include independent state-licensed mortgage lenders, nondepository mortgage lending subsidies of bank and thrift holding companies, and mortgage brokers doing business with or serving as agents of these entities. The agencies will collaborate in determining the lessons learned and in seeking ways to better cooperate in ensuring effective and consistent examination of and improved enforcement for nondepository mortgage lenders. Working together to address jurisdictional issues and to improve information sharing among agencies, we will seek to prevent abusive and fraudulent lending while ensuring that consumers retain access to beneficial credit. I believe that the actions I have described today will help address the current problems. The Federal Reserve looks forward to working with Congress on these important issues. Thank you.",Statement,STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN, BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I am sure my colleagues will have some additional questions for you on dealing with HOEPA, but I want to express my appreciation for the Fed in deciding to aggressively pursue these issues beyond just the guidance and looking at regulations. I will try to keep this about 7 minutes a round here so can get through to everybody, at least one around anyway. And then the record will stay open, as well, for those who are not here to submit some questions. And we will try to move along. Let me, if I can, begin with the Basel II issue here. As you know, Mr. Chairman, Senator Shelby and I earlier this week sent a letter to the four banking regulators, calling on each one of them to make sure a consensus on the final regulation on Basel II, the bank capital accords, could be reached. And while I believe that no one regulator should have a veto power certainly over these important regulations, it is critically important that the final rule be in agreement among all the regulators. Proper capital accounting is obviously critically important to competitiveness and to the safety and soundness of our financial institutions. Capital should be based on risk not who the regulator is, in my view. One, I would ask if you would agree that there would be tremendous value to have a rule that all four regulators agree to? And conversely, obviously would it be a failure if there was a failure to reach consensus? I know you are working at this, but I want to raise that issue with you. I know how important you think it is but it is extremely important there be this consensus. I realize that you are working toward that but why don't you share with us how that is moving?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I think we agree that the existing Basel I capital system is no longer adequate for the largest international banks and that we need to move expeditiously forward to provide a new capital standard that will appropriately link capital to risk taking. I think that the Basel II approach, with perhaps some modifications but in essence what was agreed upon with the international banking authorities, is the right approach for providing that kind of capital base protection. We are already rather late in this process. We have delayed the process for a year. Therefore, it is very essential that we do move expeditiously. I can assure you that the four agencies are currently working very hard on a range of issues. Again, we all appreciate the importance of making progress. With respect to your question, I too would strongly prefer that all four agencies would come together and agree on a single proposal. And I am relatively optimistic that we will be able to achieve that in the near future.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you for that. I suspect Senator Shelby may raise a question about that as well, since we both have a strong interest in that conclusion. And we urge you to do everything you can in these coming days to reach that consensus, because of the importance of it, as you have stated here. Let me move, if I can, to the currency manipulation issue. I know because of your previous testimony before the Committee, the issue was raised here about a speech that you gave during that trip to China along with Secretary Paulson and others in which you said that China's exchange rate practices amounted to an effective subsidy. I know there was longer remarks than that alone, but nonetheless that comment was one that certainly attracted some attention. As you are aware, there is great concern to me and to many of our colleagues here on this issue. Senator Shelby and I have introduced some legislation that has the support of many of our colleagues here, Senator Bayh, Senator Carper, Senator Brown, Senator Casey, Senator Bunning, Senator Dole, on this Committee. I should point out that Senator Baucus in the Finance Committee has also introduced some legislation. He and I have talked about this. The issue of currency is appropriately a matter of jurisdiction of this Committee but nonetheless there is a strong interest reflected by Senator Baucus, and Senator Schumer as well has a strong interest in this subject matter. And so there is, without a doubt here, as you gather, among Democrats and Republicans, while there may be disagreements on a lot of other issues on this one there seems to be a growing consensus here of our concern about the currency manipulation. In fact, it is our attention here to try before the August recess to possibly markup some legislation which we have introduced and I discussed with you here. I wonder if you could still share with us your opinion about this matter here, what it means, and some reflection on where you think this is heading. Because it is a deep, deep concern regarding our manufacturing base in this country that struggles every day to stay open and competitive in global markets. Share with us, if you will, your thoughts on this matter today.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I share your concern, I share your frustration about the slow pace of the appreciation of Chinese currency. I have argued, as I did in that speech you referred to in China, that further appreciation of the currency would, in fact, be in China's interest for a number of reasons. First, it would give them an independent monetary policy. And they are, at this point, dealing with some issues of inflation and asset price increases that would be better dealt with if they had an independent monetary policy. And second, again in reference to my comments about distortions, their economy is too oriented toward exports, not enough toward the home market. And I believe that appreciation would better help orient the economy toward serving domestic needs and domestic consumers rather than relying entirely on the global market. So, I agree with your premise that it is important that the Chinese begin to appreciate further. Let me just raise a couple of issues which I guess I would call tactical issues without addressing any specific legislative proposal. The first is that the currency, while an important issue, is probably in itself not going to solve the trade imbalance problem. There are fundamental saving investment imbalances, both in the United States and abroad, which need to be changed in order to make real progress on the trade balance. In particular, we have emphasized with the Chinese the importance of structural changes in their economy such as increased safety net and improved financial system that would increase the share of their output going to consumers and being consumed at home. The combination of currency appreciation and this other set of measures is really what is needed to begin to move things in the right direction. So, I would urge you to broaden focus just a bit beyond the currency to talk about the savings and investment balances that need to be adjusted in both the United States and in China. The other point I would just make from I guess essentially a tactical point of view is that, again as I understand the frustration and concern about this particular issue and I advocate and I urge the Chinese to move their currency up more quickly, the United States and China have a wide range of issues on which we need to collaborate, coordinate, and cooperate including energy and the environment and financial services and trade and many other issues. I hope that as we look toward these sorts of measures that we try to keep in mind the importance of engaging China on a wide range of questions and not simply restricting our attention to this one important issue. But it is only one of many issues. Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate that and I do not disagree that there are these other critical questions. In fact, Title II of our legislation deals with some of the trade issues here that you have raised, and I think--I will let Senator Shelby speak for himself here obviously--but we understand the importance of that as well. I cannot begin to tell you however, Mr. Chairman, of the difficulty there is for those of us who go back to our constituencies and talk about these issues here with, day after day, Chinese firms that export to the United States enjoying what you called an effective export subsidy, as a result of their undervaluation. So it makes it very difficult for those of us to try to make the case that there are a variety of issues that we need to be working with the Chinese on. I think all of us would agree with you on that. But this issue lurks as this huge obstacle to those issues, particularly when American jobs are being so adversely affected by this. Is it still your opinion that this is an effective subsidy on that issue?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","It is not a subsidy in the legal sense, that a subsidy is a payment by the government directly to producers to support their production. Nothing like that is going on. That is not what I was referring to. I was talking about the economic implication which is that the undervalued exchange rate creates a distortion in the economy which artificially sends resources into the export sector as opposed to in the domestic sector. So it is a distortion in the economy. From a legal perspective it is not the same thing as a subsidy.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","No, I know. I notice you said effective subsidy.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Or implicit.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Implicit subsidy. Thank you very much. Let me turn to my colleague, Senator Shelby.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. I want to pick up on what Senator Dodd was talking about, the Chinese. We have been dealing with this a long time. And whether it is a direct subsidy, Mr. Chairman, or a backyard subsidy they have an advantage there obviously because of the currency situation, to their advantage and to our detriment. A lot of us represent States that have substantial manufacturing industries there and we have seen ourselves the erosion of a lot of these jobs, not just in Alabama but Ohio, Connecticut, New Jersey, you name it. We have to answer to our constituents. And the American people, they know something is wrong. They know something is wrong and they look to us to do something about it and I know it is very complicated myself. But on the other hand, do we just continue to sit back and say well, everything is fine, when we know it is not fine. We know there is an advantage there. They are manipulating it to their advantage, in my judgment. The other thing I wanted to pick up on, what Senator Dodd has already raised, and that is Basel. I do hope, Mr. Chairman, I know you are one of the regulators, too, here. But we have talked to the FDIC Chairperson and others. Senator Dodd and I have been on this Committee quite a while. We were here during the savings and loan debacle when the Government, the taxpayers, spent billions and billions of dollars. And that is not fun. And we want to avoid that. I agree with Senator Dodd that I do not know of any bank, financial institution, that has gone bankrupt or has become insolvent that is well-capitalized and well-managed, you know, in combination. And if we are going through this international accord to lower our capital standards, that is probably to us. Everybody on this Committee--I cannot speak for everybody but just about, Democrats and Republicans, because we have that oversight responsibility here. And ultimately we do not want this to land in our lap. Is that right, Senator Dodd?",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","That is right.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","So, I will move on to some other things. Subprime problems. The subprime problems are real, not just in New Jersey and Ohio but in Alabama and everywhere else. There has been a huge expansion, Mr. Chairman, as you know, of structured financial products. We call what, collateralized debt obligations backed by subprime debt. In concept these projects involve converting highly risky loans, as I understand it, into a collection of securities that have a range of risk from AAA to junk. The rating agencies provide the AAA ratings based on the idea that the structure of the products satisfactorily dissipates or spreads the risks associated with the underlying prime loan. That is the basis of that. But it appears that is not always working. It appears that many of the assumptions here regarding these structured products, collateralized, have significantly underestimated the true risk. We have seen what the rating agencies, it has been talked about, at least Senator Menendez and also Senator Brown brought it up. We have seen S&P--and I believe Senator Reed. We have seen S&P and Moody's already downgrading the debt that they invited as AAA. How did they get to the point to rate a lot of these collateralized obligations AAA grade with so much underlying junk you might say? You cannot make gold out of lead. We know that. That has been tried. Does all of this deeply concern you, how this came about to begin with? Because I think the subprime not only has deep repercussions when a lot of people, our constituents that have been victimized I think to some extent by this. But a lot of it has been brought about by very ingenious financial people. And then looks like the rating agencies fell right in line with them, knowing that this is not really AAA stuff. This is questionable stuff. Now it is coming home to roost. And, as someone else said earlier here, a lot of those loans are going to be reset not downward but upward. Senator Dodd is very much out front on this, and should be as the Chairman of this Committee. And we are deeply concerned that the subprime problem is not going to just be contained so easily but could deeply spread and have some repercussions out there. What do you think?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, let me address the financial side. We have talked about this effect on homeowners. On the financial side, I am not sure there is anything essentially wrong with structured credit products, per se. But what we have learned since early this year is that a lot of the subprime mortgage paper is not as good as was thought originally. And there clearly are going to be significant financial losses associated with defaults and delinquencies on these mortgages. As a result, the credit quality of many of the structured projects that include in them substantial amounts of subprime mortgage paper is being downgraded. The one issue is that the structured credit products are quite complex. They include many different kinds of assets. Then the risks are divided up in different so-called ``tranches.'' So it takes quite a complex model or analysis to determine what the real value of these things is.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","But the value seems to be going down instead of up.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, it is going down because the credit losses associated with subprime have come to light and they are fairly significant. Some estimates are on the order of between $50 billion and $100 billion of losses associated with subprime credit products. The credit rating agencies have begun to try to make sure they account for those losses and they have downgraded some of these products. I should say that the investors, many of them, recognize even before the downgrades occurred that there were risks associated with these products including not only credit risks but also liquidity and interest rate and other types of risks. And so the spreads they were charging on these products were not necessarily the same as would be implied by the credit rating agency. Senator, if I could just say one word about Basel, I would be very grateful. It is simply not the case that Basel II is about lowering credit standards. It is about making the banking system safer, not less safe.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","I did not say credit standards. We are about capital.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Capital standards, I am sorry. Capital standards, thank you. The system we have now, Basel I, was designed 20 years ago for a very different kind of banking world. Banks are far more obligated. They use much more off balance sheets types of operations. The existing Basel I Accord, as the GAO study that just came agrees, and as the international banking community strongly agrees, is not safe for the largest and most sophisticated international banking organizations. And so it is not a question of going to lower capital standards. It is a question of finding a new system that will provide capital on a risk-adjusted basis that will match the capital against the risk, and therefore make these banks safer not less safe. So we take a backseat to nobody in the importance of making sure that these banks are safe and sound. That is our primary objective. And we believe that making this change to Basel II will increase, not decrease, the safety of these banks. In addition, of course, in any change from one system to another there is going to be a period of uncertainty as we work through the new methods and so on. And so we have been very careful to include a wide variety of protections including, as you know, the leverage ratio, prompt corrective action, the transition floors, Pillar II, a wide variety of things that will make sure that we have the control that we need to begin to see any unsafe drops in capital, we can make the changes to ensure that the banks are operating safely and soundly. So, I would just very strongly urge you to consider that Basel II is not about lowering capital, it is about making banks safer.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","But some banks believe it is about lowering capital. There has been a lot of stuff written about it. At the end of the day they said it would free up their capital, in other words lower the capital. That is some of our concerns.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","What they are referring to is situations, there are situations where banks under the old system are forced to hold a lot of capital against which is essentially very safe assets. That part of the capital is excess capital. One of the problems they face is that foreign banks that do not have as much capital against these very safe assets will be able to just come and take that business away because they do not cost as much. So against a safe asset and one whose risk is appropriately calibrated, it seems to me appropriate to reduce capital. But against risky assets, we need to have enough capital to ensure safety.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","We want to make sure our banking system is strong. We have a great banking system. And we do not need to weaken the pillars in any way. Mr. Chairman, thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Shelby. Senator Brown.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, your response to Chairman Dodd about China, I appreciate your talking in terms of broadening the discussion beyond currency, Chinese savings, their domestic economy. You have talked in the past about intellectual property as you should. I would also implore you in the future, if you would, to also bring in labor issues in terms of slave labor, in terms of child labor, in terms of fair labor practices. We discussed that back several months ago when you were here, on international labor organization standards. I hope that your broadening the discussion of the issues with China trade and our trade in our bilateral trade deficit which, in my first year in Congress in 1992 when I ran, was in the low double digits with China. And today is way in excess of $200 billion. As you know that, without prodding, would include labor issues in this discussion. I would like to switch with a couple questions on the whole issue of the subprime loans. I appreciate your willingness to act under the HOEPA authority this year. I think the progress you have made is generally good. We would obviously like, if possible, for you to move a little more quickly but understanding how things go sometimes. But a couple of questions. With the closing fees that people pay, it seems that the prepayment penalties, it seems to me do not seem that necessary from the investors standpoint. They seem more designed to lock people into bad loans. Wouldn't the better protection for lenders be to offer a fair loan in the first place rather than the prepayment penalties?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, we are looking at that very carefully. Our subprime mortgage guidance, which has already been issued with the other banking agencies, takes the position that prepayment penalties should not extend into the period where the interest rates reset. So they should not prevent people from refinancing when their industries are about to go up. We are looking at that specifically as part of our HOEPA rules, as well. I agree with you, there are situations where prepayment penalties are not in the interest of the borrowers and we are looking at those.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Are those just guidelines or are those actually requirements?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","They are requirements. That is, they are enforced by examination and supervision of the banks. But the subprime guidance, which is a collaboration of the four banking agencies, applies only to banks and thrifts and not to lenders outside of the banking system, which is what the HOEPA was about, would apply to everything.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","If this is about investors protecting their interests, as it should be in part, doesn't failure to escrow create the very risk that prepayment penalties allegedly guard against?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","That is another issue that we heard a lot about in our hearings in June. It also is covered in the subprime guidance and is also one of the things we are looking at very carefully for our rulemaking.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","How are you approaching the determining of borrowers ability to repay a loan? You emphasize the importance. Are we setting standards on that level, also?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Once again, there is some reference to that in the subprime guidance, the idea being there that the loan should be underwritten at the fully indexed rate, that is that the rate once the adjustable resets have taken place. I should say though, particularly from the perspective of writing a rule, we are going to do our very best. But it is hard to put into a rule exactly what criteria one would use in order to decide whether a loan is affordable or not. But we are going to do our best. In particular, we are going to look at the question of underwriting to the fully indexed rate. And also, ask ourselves whether or not there can be guidelines in terms of demonstrated payment ability or demonstrated income that we related to the payments under the mortgage.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","But there are some things, understanding the difficulty of writing a rule to conclude everything, but there are certainly some things, no doc loans, better disclosures, so people understand in readable large print, if you will, on the first page what this loan is going to cost, what their adjustable rate could be in worse case scenario. All of those absolutely could be included; right?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","These are all on our agenda. The top page of the mortgage documents that you are alluding to is part of our Regulation Z review which will cover all home mortgage advertising solicitation and disclosures. One concern we have about that is just that in the past these disclosures have been written by lawyers sitting in an agency. And when we put them out, the public does not understand what it really means. And so if you are going to have effective disclosures, they have to be done in a way that ordinary people can understand what the implications are. And for that reason we have, for the Government at least, been very innovative in making sure that all of our disclosures are being consumer tested and focus group tested. And we are making sure that people really do understand what the disclosure is telling them. I think that is critical if this is really going to be effective and not just a cosmetic step.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","And you can write that prescriptively in your rule?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","We can prescribe the form, yes.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","In several of the answers, and I appreciate your answers, you spoke in terms of it is on your agenda. A skeptical look would say that implies some inertia. Are you pleased, personally, with the speed at which you are doing this? Chairman Dodd has talked about and Senator Shelby has talked about with a number of resets in the next couple of years and the number of people who are going to lose their life savings every week, every day, every week, every month. Are you satisfied you are moving as fast as you can?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I believe that we are moving as fast as we responsibly can. We have to do it right. We have to make sure the disclosures, for example, are actually of value. And we have to follow, of course, the rules and regulations associated with how an agency makes rules. Congress has told us what steps we have to take and we have to follow those steps. I would say to you, Senator, if you feel that the regulatory process is too slow the only remedy I can think of is for Congress to act directly.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","We always move fast enough, too, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I understand.",Speech,
"Senator Brown","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Let me just say in that regard, Mr. Chairman, before I turn to Senator Reed here, my hope would be that you--and I am sure you will--keep us posted on the progress of this. I had a chance to speak with the Chairman a day or so ago about the very matter that Senator Brown has raised here. My hope is that you would give us a commitment to come back to the Committee once the regulation comes out to discuss it with the Committee, we would have a strong interest. I see your head nodding affirmatively.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","I appreciate that response, as well. It will give us a chance to move on this.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you,",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I want to return to the topic that I broached in my opening statement and Senator Shelby addressed. And that is the issue of the valuation of CDOs. What you have is an illiquid market, basically. There is a thinly traded, very complex instruments, asset valuation is difficult to determine. As a result, what we have is something described as mark to ratings. Senator Shelby alluded to that. How comfortable are you with this approach? What are you doing specifically to engage the rating agencies to ensure that they are, and the originators of these products are, valuing their assets accurately? As I pointed out in my opening statement, there seems to be a growing wave and realization that these assets are overvalued. Some people have suggested billions and billions of dollars. What appears to be the motivating factor in the workout of the Bear Stearns funds was the extreme reluctance to try to have the market evaluate these assets and that would cause a value of mark to market for everything else they held and probably through the whole system. This is potentially a very serious problem. So specifically what are you doing with the rating agencies and the originators of these products to make sure they are valued effectively?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","The Federal Reserve does not have any specific powers or responsibilities regarding the rating agencies themselves. What we are doing is working with our banks that we supervise to ensure that they are safe and sound and that they are doing due diligence in the types of assets that they purchase or the types of assets they themselves securitize and resell. So our perspective is protecting the safety of the banking system. We do not have broader authority to dictate how these assets are created.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Should someone have the broader authority to do that? I mean if we assume, as I think you perhaps might, that the market will not evaluate these assets accurately because they are so thinly traded, difficult to understand, it falls upon a rating agency. And if the rating agency, if there is no supervision, is there a gap?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","No, I think the market will find solutions. They already are finding some. For example, even if the individual instruments are not particularly liquid, there are indices that are based on the payments from CDOs or CLOs which are traded and therefore give some sense of the market valuation of these underlying assets. So this is a market innovation. Sometimes there are bumps associated with a market innovation. I think we just have to sit and see how it works out. There are very strong incentives in the market to change the structure of these instruments as needed to make them attractive to investors.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Let me change gears just slightly. You alluded to it, not the CDOs but the CLOs, the collateralized loan obligations, essentially derivatives of corporate debt. There has been a lot of discussion that it is very easy now to go out in this market and to prop up companies that do not have the ability to borrow directly. And that the underwriting standards have slipped a bit because the banks who typically do the underwriting do not hold the product. They move them out very quickly in these complex secondary markets. First, can you comment on the underwriting standards for the corporate borrowing? Are they loosening to a degree that could--",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Recently, I think they perhaps tightened a bit, actually, because of some concerns that were initially prompted by the subprime mortgage lending issues. Again from the Federal Reserve's perspectives, our principal concern is the safety and soundness of the banking system. What we have done recently is work with other regulators such as the SEC and the OCC and, in some cases also with foreign regulators, the FSA in the United Kingdom for example and German and Swiss regulators, to do what we call horizontal reviews which is that collectively we look at the practices of a large set of institutions, both commercial banks and investment banks, to see how they are managing certain types of activities. For example, the financing of leveraged buyouts, abridged equity and the like. And trying to make an evaluation of what are best practices, trying to give back information back to the companies and trying to use those reviews to inform our own supervision. And so we are very aware of these issues from the perspective of the risk-taking by large financial institutions and we are studying them, trying to provide information to the institutions themselves, and using them in our own supervisory guidance.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Are you confident that you can identify and monitor these risks posed by CLOs? And in a related point, do you anticipate seeing the same phenomena in the CLO market that we have seen in the CDO market, a bump?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","It is not our expertise to directly say that this deal is a good deal and that deal is a bad deal. What we try to do is make sure that the banks and the investment banks themselves have good controls, have good models, have good approaches, have good risk management so that they can make what we believe to be, in general, appropriate decisions about these instruments.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Let me shift gears again, Mr. Chairman, to try to cover a lot of ground. We have witnessed all a booming housing market until very recently. As your predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, opined in many homes their increasing equity valuation was an ATM that they could go to without leaving the house. Current estimates are that equity withdrawals are down precipitously, 70 percent from 2005. What is your view of the macroeconomic effect as people can no longer essentially use their equity as a quick source of cash?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Taking equity out of a home is one very convenient and sometimes tax favored way of getting at your assets essentially. That explains the tremendous increase in that type of cash out refinancing and home equity loans. Our sense though, and so far this seems to be borne out by the data, is that consumers respond to changes in the value of their home essentially because there is a change in their wealth not because there is a change in their access to liquid assets. So there is probably something on the order of between four cents and nine cents on the dollar of an effect on consumer spending when home values decline. So that is one of the things we are looking at. It should be pointed out that by, I think, the most reliable indices that house prices nationally speaking have not declined. They have only risen more slowly. So we have not yet seen anything, except in a few local areas, akin to a decline in house prices. So again, we have not seen a significant effect on consumption. We are watching it carefully. Once again, I think the so-called ``wealth effect,'' the effect that the value of the home has on the consumer's overall wealth is probably the principal relationship between house values and consumer spending.",Speech,
"Senator Reed","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Reed. As colleagues are coming in here, so my colleagues are aware, Senator Bunning has arrived. We will then turn to Senator Menendez, then Senator Allard. Senator Schumer has come back and then Senator Carper and Senator Bayh have joined us, as well. I thank you for being here.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First of all, I would like to enter my opening statement into the record.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING
"Chairman Dodd","All statements, by the way, will be included in the record and we will leave the record open for a day or so for other questions.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","I figured that. I do not want to go over old business but I have to because everybody looked at the past Fed Chairman and the past Fed's oversight of the banking industry and what happened in the subprime area. The banks all looked very good when you looked at their bank statements. But what happened is that those mortgages, ARMs, interest-only loans were sold off. And therefore the bank statements all look clean. But where we found we had a problem was that they were overextended, a lot of people were overextended. Instead of buying a $400,000 home it should have been a $200,000 home. Instead of an interest-only loan, it should have been a 30-year mortgage and on down on the line. That did not show up on the Fed's record but I do not think the Fed went far enough. Do you have the capability of going far enough now to see what happens to the loan after the bank sells it off ?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Again, our interest in this particular case is in bank safety and soundness. And the question: Is there any recourse question? Does the bank have any responsibility for that loan?",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","All of them had responsibility when they were originally taken out.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","There are two issues, Senator. One is the consumer protection issue and one is the safety and soundness issue. On safety and soundness, the question is does the bank have financial responsibilities in case the loan goes bad? In which case they should have capital against that. This is an example of why Basel I does not adequately capture the necessary----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","That is why we did Basel II.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","That is exactly right. On the consumer side, the issue is where was the loan made? In some cases, the bank simply bought up packaged loans that were made somewhere else. And there part of the problem is that it used to be that you could only get a loan at the bank or a thrift. Now of course, there is a great diversity of lending institutions and it is not entirely a level playing field in terms of the oversight of their consumer protection.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Please get to my question.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I am sorry, what is the question?",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","The question is does the Fed now have the ability to go beyond the original bank and find out what happened to that loan when it went sour? In other words, if they sold that loan off to a third party and now the people are incapable of making the payments or it was an interest-only loan or there was an ARM that popped up after 5 years.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","We can follow where the bank initially disposes of the loan. But if it goes through several steps, then we can only make general estimates.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","You do not figure that you have a responsibility in that respect?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I do not think we have the authority.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","You do not have the authority but how about the responsibility?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Without authority, I cannot be responsible, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Let me go back to inflation and interest rates. In your statement you repeated a line from the June Fed statement that says ``A sustained moderation in inflationary pressure has yet to be convincingly demonstrated.'' Those are quotes. What will it take for moderation to be convincingly demonstrated?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Our objective is to achieve enduring price stability and in particular we want to be sure that inflation remains under good control in the medium run. There are several elements of that. One is that I think it is important to recognize that the month-to-month inflation numbers are very noisy. And so a couple of good numbers does not, by itself, mean that the problem is solved and gone away. So part of it is just simply seeing more data and getting a greater sense of assurance that the trend is really in the direction we would like to see it. The other is that as long as there are some very important risks out there to inflation, there is the possibility of inflation--even if it has come down some--there is the possibility that it will go back up in the future. The risks that I talked about in my testimony include high resource utilization, the fact that the economy is working at a very tight use of resources. And second, the fact that energy and food prices have raised headline inflation. Those prices might feed through into core inflation, they might raise inflation expectations. So what we need to see is enough confidence that the risks have subsided so that we can feel confident that in the medium term inflation will be well-controlled.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Last week, you gave a speech and spoke at length about inflation expectations. You also said that expectations are ``imperfectly anchored.'' What in the world does ``imperfectly anchored'' mean?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, it means that expectations as measured through various means are not at a fixed number. That is, if a piece of news comes in, about, say, employment that long-term inflation expectations move. And what that means is that although the confidence in the Federal Reserve to maintain price stability----",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Isn't that in your model when you are looking at inflation, all the different things that you put in?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I am thinking now about the very long- term. So if there was complete confidence--let me not overstate. I think there is a great confidence in the Federal Reserve that we will maintain low inflation in the long-term. But if that confidence were complete then people would say oh, this is a temporary movement in the economy but we know that in the long-term inflation is going to go back to whatever is the normal level. And there would not be much movement in these longer-term inflation expectations when there was a short-term development in the economy.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","But that is exactly what you are trying to do every time you meet, is to anticipate----",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","We are trying to anticipate it. But in order to make sure that inflation in the long-term is very stable. If people are saying oil prices have gone up, that not only affects what we think inflation is going to do over the next year but it affects what we think inflation is going to be 5 years from now. Then that leads to the possibility that they do not have complete confidence that the Fed to bring inflation back down to a stable level. Again, let me not overstate this. I think that we have made tremendous progress over the last 20 years or so in increasing the confidence the public has in the Fed's ability to keep inflation low and stable. I am only saying that there is still some imperfect degree in terms of which those expectations are completely tied down.",Speech,
"Senator Bunning","Mr. Chairman, we know we are not all perfect and we know that the Fed does the best they can. We appreciate your service and thank you for being here.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, I appreciate the testimony you have given on the subprime issue and the actions. But I am wondering if the actions reflect the crisis at hand. I find it hard to believe that months of hearings and reviews, a pilot project that will not commence until the end of the year, and guidance after guidance that seems to take only small steps, is a swift enough response for a crisis that has led to over one million foreclosures last year and ruined the American Dream of owning a home for too many people in this country. With all due respect, when, as part of that challenge, we are talking about predatory lending, I am not convinced that the proposals the Fed has put forward will be enough to stop predatory lenders dead in their tracks. I also hope that we have at least prospectively a better monitoring system because it is my personal opinion that, in many respects, the Fed was somewhat asleep at the switch, that we could have been more proactive in this process. It seems to me we are coming to the table with a plan after a tornado has already ripped through a community. So, I hope that the one message I think many of our colleagues have for you and the Reserve is that you will be as swift and use the powers that were given to you under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act as vigorously as we would like to see you use them. I hope that that is both your intent, your mission, and in terms of timing within the context of being judicious but not be judicious to the point that we err on the side of being able to protect more people in this country. I would like to hear your response to that in a moment. Let me get my second line of question and give you the balance of the time to answer. In my mind, I always ask who is this economy working for? Is inflation tame or is it still a significant problem? I guess that depends upon where you sit. Consumer prices rose at a moderate rate in June with a key factor keeping things under control is collapsing clothing costs. They have dropped for the past 4 months. But after energy, clothing is probably about the next most volatile component in the Consumer Price Index. So, I would not be surprised if sometime soon we see a major increase in prices in that regard. In addition, we already know that the pullback in gasoline prices in June has been unwound so energy will be adding greatly to consumer woes in July. And then there is food. As you mentioned yourself, prices jumped again and since June 2006 food and beverage costs have risen by 4 percent. With that, with the ethanol issues that are spiraling through food costs, I do not know that we can be looking for relief anytime soon, at least if you are looking at it from the context of the consumer. It seems to me that pain for the consumer is still there. When I look at household debt in America that has risen to record levels over the past 5 years. In the first quarter of 2007, household debt relative to disposable income stood at 130.7 percent. That is the third highest ratio on record. That means the average family in America is in debt for over $130 for every $100 it has to spend. Compounding this, the average household savings rate has actually been negative for the past seven quarters, averaging a negative 1 percent for 2006. One last measurement, one measure of this economic insecurity that I hear New Jerseyans talk to me about, that I hear other Americans talk about, is the percentage of middle- class families who have at least 3 months of their salary in savings. That percentage of middle-class families who had three or more months salary in savings rose over 72 percent from 16.7 percent in 1992 to 28 percent in 2001. But unfortunately, in the span of less than 4 years that percentage has dropped to 18.3 percent in 2004. So, I am looking at this and I am saying to myself so you have rising food costs, you have rising energy costs, rising health costs. You have stagnant median income for the last 5 years for families in this country. You have more debt, the third-highest ratio on record, and you have less families in quite some time that have 3 months and savings or more. Who is this economy working for? And is inflation tame or is it still a significant problem?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, you asked a lot of questions.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","I have given you a lot of time. I have not even used all my time. You can take that and plus the rest of what is necessary to answer.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","First, on the subprime rules, as I said, I asked for a top to bottom review. We looked at every possible power that we have. We have examined each one. We have had a lot of input, a lot of hearings, and we are moving forward. We will move as expeditiously as the process allows, making sure, of course, that we do a good job. But we will move forward as expeditiously as possible to try to address these issues. With respect to inflation, I agree in the sense that certainly over 2007 food and energy prices have risen significantly so that the overall inflation rate is higher than we would like it to be. Our concern is that high food and energy prices might somehow infect the underlying trend of inflation, for example causing people's expectations--this is Senator Bunning's question--to rise and become less persuaded that inflation will be stable in the long-run. Therefore, that is part of the reason why we continue to treat inflation as our predominant policy concern. With respect to the household financial situation, it is a complicated story. Part of the reason that official saving rates for households are negative as that those saving rates do not include any capital gains in assets that households may own. So in some cases, people have had their homes appreciated, as happened over the last 5 years until recently and they took money out, the money they took out would count as spending but the appreciation in their home would not count the saving. So that has been part of the reason that saving has been so low, that people have seen increases until recently in their home equity. As that situation flattens out----",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","But if they took their savings on their appreciation, the only way to do that would be to sell and/or accrue debt?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","No, they can make use of some of their capital gains by home equity loans or refinancing.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","But that would be accruing debt.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I am sorry?",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","If you take a loan out in order to get to your accrued appreciation, now you are going into debt to do that.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","But if I have $1,000 appreciation and I take out $500 in debt, I have increased my debt by $500 but I am still, on net, $500 better off than when I started. Now having said all that, let me just say that I agree with you on the issue of consumers needing to build wealth and assets. The Federal Reserve manages the Survey of Consumer Finances, which is the best available source for family asset building, information about family asset holdings. The fact is that the bottom third of our population has almost no savings, maybe less than $500. And I think that is a very serious problem. We need to find ways to make people more cognizant of the need to save, to help them to save, so that they can build wealth and that they will have more security in case they have, for example, an illness or an unemployment spell. So your general point that there are many families that do not have adequate wealth reserve, I think is entirely correct.",Speech,
"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. Correct me if I am wrong, Mr. Chairman, but the numbers I have used, what I am told is that the average household has revolving debt in excess of $9,000, most of that being credit card debt. Just to make the point that Senator Menendez is talking about, and a negative savings rate. These are very disturbing statistics, if in fact those numbers increase like that. That is just unacceptable, I think.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I have an opening statement I would like to have put in the record, if you would, please.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR WAYNE ALLARD
"Chairman Dodd","All opening statements will be put in the record.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Thank you very much. I want to talk about a little bit about stock market and some of the things that are going on there and how you view those. You have been getting a lot of articles written about hedge funds and private refunds and the like. Are they of much concern as far as the Fed is concerned?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Hedge funds and private equity funds and other private pools of capital provide some very important beneficial services to the U.S. economy. They represent a way to share risks more broadly. Instead of all the risk sitting in the banking system, it can be spread through a whole different set of institutions. They provide a lot of liquidity in financial markets. It is easier to buy and sell when the hedge funds are taking part in market activity. And one other particular area where private equity is valuable, it is important for our economy to have an active market for corporate control. That is we need to have some way of putting pressure on poorly managed companies or poor management that will create some discipline and improve our economic performance. We had LBOs in the 1980s. Private equity is the current manifestation of that. Not all private equity deals are beneficial and not all of them work out well, but we do need to have a mechanism that strengthens the efficiency of our corporate sector. Now are there concerns? There are some concerns. Hedge funds in private equity are relatively opaque in terms of seeing what their assets are. And they vary considerably in the types of investments that they make. Recently, the President's Working Group issued a set of principles which argue that the best way to control the risk of hedge funds and other private pools of capital is through market discipline, by which we mean that the first line of defense should be the investors, the counterparties, the creditors, those people in the market who have the most to lose if a hedge fund goes bust, for example. The role of the supervisors is to make sure that banks and other counterparties are, in fact, getting the information they need, managing the risk in the way they need to so that should there be any problems in a hedge fund that it does not spread more broadly probably in the financial system. So, I think that is the best way to manage the risks in those pools of capital.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Now has Sarbanes-Oxley contributed to the growth of the hedge funds, in your view?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","If you are referring to the private equity in particular, taking firms private, there is some disagreement about that. I think I would point out that private equity is also a very big thing in the UK, as well, where Sarbanes-Oxley is obviously not relevant. So, I do not think it is the principal explanation. I think that what is happening is that financing is available and there are these firms that feel that they can essentially do a better job of running certain corporations than the existing management is.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","If taxes were applied to these equity funds and these hedge funds, would that have an adverse impact on our economy?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I do not want to take a position on particular tax rules. I think I would just point out that hedge funds have a lot of international flexibility. They can move around. And even if they are based in another place they can still operate with U.S. corporations. And so I think there is a lot of international mobility, so to speak, in these institutions.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","This leads me to the next question. We have these sovereign wealth funds, apparently.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","They are Government Sponsored Entities and apparently they are pretty flush with cash right now. How do you view them as impacting our economy and our risk in the securities?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I have talked about in the past what I called the global saving glut, which is basically the idea that outside the United States there is a huge amount of funds looking for returns. That includes reserves of China and other countries that have accumulated lots of reserves. But it also includes the profits from oil and commodity sales. And that is a lot of where the sovereign wealth funds are based on revenues from, say, oil sales. So a lot of that capital is looking for return, is looking for a home, and a lot of it is flowing into the United States. On net, I think that is beneficial because it provides capital for our economy. It does drive real interest rates probably lower than they might otherwise be. In terms of risk taking, the sovereign wealth funds, for the most part, are pretty passive investors. They are not active in switching between types of assets. They may sometimes have components which are more return-seeking, such as the Chinese, for example, have a component of their reserves fund that is more return-seeking. But for the most part they are pretty passive suppliers of capital.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","They are going after security more than anything; is that right?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","They are looking for return and, in particular, some of them--the purpose of sovereign wealth funds, in many cases, is to take the current windfall and to make sure it is available for future generations. So for example, Norway is taking its oil profits, putting them into this fund in order to help fund the retirement pensions of its citizens. For that purpose, it needs to have long-term safe assets. And that is the kind of investment that they tend to make.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Do you feel the free trade agreement between the United States and South Korea is having a positive or negative impact on our economy?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I am not conversant with any specific elements of that particular agreement, but in general, as most economists do, I think that opening the economy to trade is beneficial. It creates new opportunities for trade in both good and services as well as opportunities for investment. So as a general matter, I think that we should continue to keep our economy open both to trade and to investment, keeping in mind that trade and investment--international trade and investment sometimes do create dislocations in the economy and we should be prepared to address those, as well. But overall, I believe that open economies are more prosperous and would therefore support, in general, free trade type agreements.",Speech,
"Senator Allard","Mr. Chairman, I see my time has expired.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you. Senator Schumer.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Thank you. Thank you always, Mr. Chairman. I would like to return to the issue of carried interest and partnerships, as well. I know you will not take a public position on any of these but I have two questions. First is the breadth of what we do. In other words, some have said we should look at them for hedge funds and for private equity funds. But there is carried interest and publicly PTP's in other areas, oil and gas, venture capital, real estate. Does it make any economic sense to treat one of these industries differently than the other when the broad concept of either carried interest or taxing corporate partnerships who go corporate basically extends through all of them? Some have talked about singling out financial services and obviously I am very concerned about that.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, as you point out, there are two different issues.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Yes, they are separate issues.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","All else equal, I think consistent treatment under the tax code is a good approach. The carried interest turns, as you know, on how to divide the returns to hedge fund managers between compensation for services and capital gains. And there are a lot of technical issues there. I think the Treasury or the IRS might be better at figuring out the details of that. With respect to partnerships, the issue is whether or not the income can flow through directly to the partners. And the rule is that as long as more than 90 percent of the income is ``passive'' that it should. And so I think I see the argument for making the treatment uniform among partnerships. I think the question is defining what is passive and making sure we are comfortable with that definition.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","That would apply to any industry, whether it is oil and gas, venture capital, real estate, or financial services.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","So all things being equal, you should treat them all the same.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","If the underlying economic principles are the same and economic sources of income are comparable, then that is what is called horizontal equity, treating likes in the same way.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Exactly. The second question I had is the proposals to treat carried interest differently in terms of tax treatment, the same with publicly traded partnerships. You know they are out there. And there are arguments on both sides. Obviously someone from New York, but someone who believes our Government has to raise revenues and the highest income people are the appropriate place to raise those revenues--those are my beliefs, I know they are not necessarily yours. It is the very tough issue. One of the things that greatly concerns me is if we were to raise taxes in both of these ways, would there be a danger that America would decline on a percentage basis, on a general basis, as a financial center? Obviously, that would affect New York dramatically and would be of great concern to me. Now is that a worry on either of these two issues?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","On the case of carried interest, it might not affect their activities. But it might affect the location of their activities.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Yes. That is what I am worried about. If they all move to London or the Cayman Islands, I do care about that, for some strange reason.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","If they are looking for the lowest tax regime, that might be an effect. As I mentioned to Senator Allard, if the company moves to London they still could potentially be involved in U.S. investments.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","No question. But that jobs would be in London.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","But the individuals might choose to move elsewhere.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","So it is something to keep an eye on and worry about, in your opinion.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","It is a consideration. As you pointed out initially, I am not taking a position on this.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","I understand. I am just asking your economic views of these things and I appreciate it. Next, I would like to go to subprimes. Basically, you mentioned today that direct Federal legislation would help speed up the Fed's efforts to fix the problems in the subprime industry. As you know, Senators Brown, Casey, and I have introduced proposed legislation that would specifically regulate the mortgage broker industry. Our bill would establish a fiduciary duty and good faith stands for mortgage brokers and other nonbank originators and require originators to underwrite loans at the fully indexed rate, prohibit steering, among other things. First, could you give us your thoughts--I am not asking you to endorse the specific bill--but on those concepts and whether it makes sense? And are these types of proposals some that would help the Fed's efforts to regulate the subprime mortgage broker industry?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","There is a whole set of diverse initiatives that you are referring to.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Can you comment on each of them or any of them?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I will try. One issue, as you know, as we discussed earlier, is trying to make sure there is an even playing field in terms of enforcement and oversight. One suggestion that has been made is for more cooperation between Federal and State authorities, for example, through to a Federal registry or some Federal licensing. The Federal Reserve, as I mentioned, is also trying to increase our cooperation with the State authorities. And so there are different ways to approach that issue. That is certainly one thing that I think is very important to increase that coordination and cooperation if possible.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","But if the State resists you, there is not too much you can do.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","We have backup Federal authority in FTC, which is another possible vehicle.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","They have not been a tiger on----",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","As well as the U.S. Attorneys General would also have some authority in those----",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","What do you think of legislation that would require this at a Federal level?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Require which?",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","Require, say, regulation of mortgage brokers in certain ways so that there is a suitability rule.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","In terms of the uniform authority, I think one very important question to answer is if you are not going to let the States be the primary regulators, what would be the substitute? How would you propose to do that? Again, I think at this point my preferred approach would be to work with the States because many of the States are, in fact, very effective.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","I am a little confused here. I thought earlier, in reference to Senator Brown's questions, you said that Federal legislation would help speed up the Fed's efforts to fix those problems?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I was referring there to the HOEPA rules that we are considering and the other things that we are doing under our regulatory authority. We have certain procedures we have to follow in terms of putting out proposed rules and taking comments and the like. And I was only commenting that while we would move as expeditiously as possible, if Congress wanted to move more quickly, of course, legislation can override those procedural steps.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","But much of your authority here is not-- you cannot force it to happen basically if you have reluctant parties that you are trying to exert pressure on; is that correct?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Our HOEPA authority applies to all lenders. We can set rules for all lenders but we do not have the enforcement authority outside of the banks. So finding ways to have better cooperation between the Federal and State authorities, I think, is a useful direction. Another thing you have mentioned I know, and we have discussed this before, is counseling. I think that the Federal Reserve itself, the Reserve Banks around the country, are partnering with nonprofit agencies that do counseling. I, myself, have visited with some nonprofits that do counseling. It is not a panacea, in part because not all counselors are effective and so on. But it can be helpful and it is something to be kept in mind. With respect to suitability, this is, I think, a very tough issue. It has to be done in a way that will not essentially drive away interest in this market. One way of thinking about suitability--let me take a step back. If you think of suitability as requiring the lender to pick the very best of the dozens of products available for the borrower, that may be setting a standard which is not actually viable. Perhaps another way of thinking about it is equating suitability with affordability.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","That is what we do.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","And essentially saying that there is some presumption that the lender will appropriately take into account ability to pay in making the loan. And that itself turns to some of the things that we are trying to think about under our HOEPA authority, which is whether or how to require underwriting to the fully indexed rate and how or whether to require more documentation than is currently required about ability to pay, for example, and what standards one might set in terms of linking ability to pay to the monthly payment. So those are some of the issues.",Speech,
"Senator Schumer","So we are somewhat on the same page on some of these things. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Schumer. Let me thank Senator Schumer for his comments on the issue of these matters affecting the carried interest and other issues. As Chairman of the Committee, I share some of his concerns about that, in terms of there being an equitable application of these issues here, and that we understand the full implications of what may be occurring here. You have raised them very, very well. And I think it is something the entire Committee would want to express an interest in. So as we look at these issues here we may, at some point, Mr. Chairman, want to ask you to participate and ask you--I realize it is a bit--and you point out that the IRS and Treasury may be a more appropriate place to look but obviously your expertise and thoughts on this could be helpful as well, as we consider the implications of all of this. But I thank Senator Schumer for his points.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, welcome. I have two issues I want to pursue with you and get your thoughts on, but I want to make just an observation prior. I have been on this Committee now for over a dozen years. And we see the pressure going one way and then the other. First, the requirement on or the desire on the part of Members of this Committee to make capital available to the people that are poor. We have to do everything we can to make capital available to them and push in the direction. No, you are holding capital just for the rich. You have to make it available to the poor. Then when we get into the subprime problem, I understand, at least on the House side, there is legislation to hold the lender responsible for the fact that they pushed money at people who could not afford to pay it. And now that the homes are being foreclosed on it is the lender's fault and we have to punish the lender for making the capital available in the first place. It is an interesting pendulum to watch it swing back and forth in this debate. I hope we do not end up saying to the counselor, the counselor is liable if the counselor said you should make this deal rather than that deal and then the counselor has to pay the damages if, in fact, there is a problem and the people cannot pay their mortgage. The two issues I want to talk to you about are labor and housing. In my home State of Utah, the unemployment rate is two-point-something percent and the something does not really matter. When you get down that low it is a very, very serious problem. We have a labor shortage. Nationwide the unemployment rate is at levels approaching historic lows. I would like your reaction to that problem and what it might do with respect to inflation. Your predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, talked about tight labor markets and the impact of that on inflation. Productivity is going up so we have to have a different historic benchmark on unemployment figures. I was taught in college that 6 percent was full employment, that you got below 6 percent and you were facing serious inflationary pressures. Interestingly enough, at the height of the last recession the unemployment was in the 6 percent range. And now we are at 4 percent or something. So, I would like your comment on that. And then on housing, the housing bubble has the potential, in my view, of triggering an economic downturn just as the dot- com bubble that we were all excited about and thrilled about in the late 1990s triggered the recession that began in 2000 as that bubble started to burst. Everyone was delighted to see his house value go up, particularly if he did not have to buy a new one. And you referred to the number of people who took home equity loans and went out and went on a spending binge. Now the housing prices have flattened, if not fallen, in many areas. There has to be a shakeout just as there was a shakeout from the dot-com bubble there has to be a shakeout from the housing bubble. Look into your crystal ball and see if it is, in fact, going to create an economic downturn? If so, any ideas as to how severe or when? I know you do not make those specific prophecies and I am not asking you to. But just in a general term what you might see as the housing shakeout works its way through the economy. If you could address those two, I would appreciate it.",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBERT F. BENNETT
"Chairman Bernanke","Certainly Senator. Just one word on your initial comment. I agree with you that legitimate subprime lending is beneficial. It gives people access to homeownership and access to credit. So the real trick for us is to write rules, to write regulations that will screen out the abusive practices and the improper practices while preserving this market. I think that is a very challenging task.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","If I just might, a witness in a previous hearing said not all predatory lending is subprime.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","That is correct.",Speech,
"Senator Bennett","And not all subprime lending is predatory.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I agree entirely. On labor shortages, there is, I think, a very strong demand in this country for skilled workers. In particular, we hear from our contacts around the country how difficult it is to find people, not just Ph.D.'s, but people who are familiar with plumbing and welding and other kinds of what we used to think of and still think of as blue-collar type occupations. And so I think there is an enormous opportunity here, if we can help people acquire those skills, to help them obviously but also to lower the unemployment rate that the economy can sustain because we will change unskilled workers into people who can fill these spots. I think that is very important. With respect to the effect on inflation, the way I think about this is that the economy at a given time has a certain amount of normal potential output. If the Fed is too easy or other factors lead to increased aggregate demand, and that demand is exceeding the supply essentially, then you can get inflation pressures. And so the challenge for the Fed is always to balance supply and demand, to think about whether or not the level of demand that we are generating with our interest rate policies and with other policies, Government policies for example, is consistent with the underlying supply. It is not so much that a given level of employment is per se inflationary. But if the economy is overheating, one might see a temporary dip in unemployment reflecting the extra resource utilization associated with it. So we do not have a magic unemployment rate that we look at, say, that is too low or too high. What we try to do is look at the whole economy, look for sources of price pressure. Are firms finding it easy to raise prices? Are there indications that markets are very tight, both at the labor level and the product level? And we try to make a judgment about the balances of supply and demand and that helps to govern our thinking about this. The labor market, you mentioned 6 percent. The labor market changes a lot over time in terms of demographics, in terms of skills and education, in terms of job finding through the Internet and so on. And so that number is not a fixed number. We always have to think about how it might be changing over time. With respect to housing, I talked about that quite a little bit in my testimony. There is, at this point, a pretty substantial overhang of unsold new homes. So even if demand stabilizes, as we think it will soon, there is going to be a period of weakness as builders work down those inventories and reduce their construction. Housing has been subtracting from GDP growth over the last year about a percentage point. If demand stabilizes and builders begin to work down those inventories, we think that the drag, while still negative, will begin to diminish over time. And so that effect will begin to moderate. In the testimony we do mention housing as a downside risk. It is, of course, possible that declining housing values will cause consumers to spend less. It is possible that it might lead to fewer construction jobs. That might also have effects on the economy. But to this point we have not seen significant spillovers from the housing sector into other parts of the economy. Most of the rest of the economy is functioning at a pretty strong level. But that is obviously something we are very alert to, the possibility that the housing slowdown might have implications for other parts of the economy.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Chairman Dodd. And thank you, Chairman Bernanke, for your presence here today and for your service. I, too, have a keen interest in some of the issues that have been raised today, particularly the currency valuation issue in China, which tends to have an impact on our manufacturing sector, which is concentrated in the Midwest. And also in the housing issue, which is having a tremendous impact on my home State right now. But I think that territory has been pretty thoroughly covered here today, so I will perhaps focus on some other things but I did not want anyone to think that my lack of questioning in those areas evinced any disinterest. This is, of course, the beginning or we are well into a political season and I do expect you to answer any political questions. But they are going to be a number of issues debated over the next year that are going have a pretty profound impact on the course of the American economic and financial policy. So, in general terms, I would like to raise a couple of those and get your take on them if that is OK. Our economy has done pretty well over the last decade or two, in terms of the macro level of growth. But there is a growing belief that the benefits of that growth have been disproportionately concentrated in the hands of the top 1 percent or so of the American people. There is at least one candidate who points out that about 50 percent of the wealth generated over the last couple of decades has gone to the top 1 percent in our country. So my question to you is are there things that can be done to try and more equitably distribute the fruits of the growth that our economy has been generating into the hands of the middle class in this country?",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR EVAN BAYH
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, this is a very hard problem because it touches on almost all the other problems that we address as a country. I think you could break down the lack of progress of the middle class, if you like, into several different factors. One is this very long-term movement toward inequality and wages which has arisen partly because of technological change which favors higher skilled workers, to a lesser extent because of globalization. That is a long-term trend that has been going on for 30 years. That is one factor. A second factor which I think is probably temporary and I am not sure what can be done about it in any case, is that over the last few years profits have been very high and so there has been somewhat of a shift between capital and labor income. In the past, those things have corrected themselves. I am not sure that is a policy issue at this point. A third factor is the cost of energy and the cost of health care which----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Can I interrupt you for just a minute, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Sure.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","So you say in the past that the rewards to capital versus labor has tended to correct itself. If we are living in an era of more rapid rates of innovation, might that not lead it to correct perhaps not quite as quickly as in the past?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","We, of course, had many areas of rapid innovation in the past and it is just one of the long-standing economic irregularities that the share of capital and labor tends to stabilize over time. We saw in the 1990s, for example, that capital went ahead of labor for a while during the productivity boom and then labor began to catch up again. So, I do think that we will see a more normal----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","I do not want to use all my time on this question and I apologize for interrupting. We are not for redistributing wealth overtly. But to judge at least by the first part of your answer, if the economy is rewarding more highly skilled parts of the labor force better, then perhaps a focus on education, access to college, and those kind of things might empower the middle class to enjoy a larger share of the wealth.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","I agree entirely. The way I was trying to answer your question was here are some of the major things that are explaining and they all tie into these major issues, particularly this inequality. I do believe that education, in a very broad sense--not just K-12 and college--but on-the-job training, vocational schools, technical schools, junior colleges, community college, a whole variety of mechanisms can be used to give people higher skills to meet the kind of demand for workers that Senator Bennett was asking me about. I think that is a very important part of trying to reverse this increasing inequality in wages. But there are some things like energy policy and health care policy that the cost of those things have subtracted from the gains that families otherwise would have enjoyed. Those, themselves, are very important issues. The other thing I would mention is that there is a perception of greater economic insecurity, not just the level of income but that your tenure is not as long in a particular job, for example. There is some evidence of that. I would have to say it is not overwhelming evidence but there is some evidence that people spend a somewhat shorter period of time at a given job. Some have argued there is a little bit more volatility of income year-to-year than there was in the past. Part of the response of the political system to the public to try and reassure them about these huge forces of globalization and technology which are taking place is steps to try to increase or reduce the feeling of insecurity. Ways to do that include, for example, trying to make health care and pension more portable between jobs so people do not feel that if they lose their job they lose everything. There might also be more creative ways to structure unemployment insurance to help people move from one job to another, to acquire necessary training, and so on. So there are a lot of creative policies out there that could be considered. But I guess my bottom line is that this issue of income stagnation is really a multifaceted thing. It ties into almost all of these other big issues. And so a single magic bullet is probably not there. You have to address the different components of it.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Let me ask you about another component. As you are aware, we continue to face some deficits with the aging of the population, particularly on the health care side, that is going to exacerbate it. We will have to deal with that from the spending point of view. Perhaps there are revenue issues that come into that, as well. One of the issues that will be debated over the course of the next year and several months is going to be tax policy. So in my remaining 37 seconds, I will try to pose two questions to you and I hope you will address them both. How would you explain to an audience of middle-class Americans that is experiencing the economic anxiety that you just mentioned, that we tax income up to a marginal rate of 35 percent but capital gains and dividends at a 15 percent rate? How would you explain to them that that is an equitable tax policy? That is number one. Number two, there are some proposals out there to focus on the top 1 percent or so as a way to reduce the deficit, or to fund education initiatives that you just pointed out are important, or health care initiatives, that thing. Some people argue that that will have a drag effect on the economy. I think that argument was made back in 1993, the last time rates were raised in the top brackets. In fact, the economy did very well. So if you could address how do you explain to middle Americans the disparity between how we tax income versus capital gains and dividends on the one hand? And second, what would the likely effect on the economy be of looking at the top 1 percent, given the history in 1993 and the effect or lack thereof that that had at that point in time?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator Bayh, I hope you can appreciate my position as the head of the nonpartisan central bank that I do not want to take----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","I am asking in a purely theoretical context,",Speech,
"Mr. Chairman","",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","A theoretical question. I will make a couple responses. One, the tax code overall, the general progressivity of the tax code has not changed radically. On the one hand, you mentioned 35 percent. At one point, of course, the top marginal rate was 28 percent 20 years ago. We have also seen a lot of credits for--so forth and so on.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Here is what we have going on. Forgive me for interrupting your thoughts. That is all true. We now tax capital gains and dividends at 15. As you pointed out, given the trend in the economy, it skewed the returns toward capital a little more than labor. And yet there is the difference in the tax rates, even though on labor it was much higher in the past at the top marginal rate.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","To answer your question, what a defender would say is that there are both equity and efficiency arguments for differential taxation. The equity argument is much capital income is also taxed, for example, at the level of the corporation. The efficiency argument is that in order to promote saving and risk-taking and investment it is better to put a lower tax on capital income. And then your concern about the differential between labor income and capital income is an argument that would be made on the other side. So it is a very long-standing debate in economics.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","And about the likely grow effect of changing the marginal rate on the top 1 percent, given the experience after 1993, the last time that was done?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","After 1993 there was a lot of things happening besides changes in fiscal policy.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","There always are.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Let me say something which I think is objective or at least as objective as can be, is that the studies that have been done of the revenue benefits of the very top rate suggest the revenues are pretty small from doing that. So if you want to have a substantial revenue impact, you would probably have to go down somewhat further than 1 percent. So there really is a question of trading off the revenue versus whatever efficiency benefits might be involved. I cannot give you a precise estimate of what----",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","On the marginal effect on growth.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","--the marginal impact. I do believe as a general matter that there is some trade-off. As you raise marginal tax rates, you do tend to get a less efficient economy. But the exact trade-off, economists have not really pinpointed it precisely.",Speech,
"Senator Bayh","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator. I do not know if I heard you, in response to Senator Bayh's excellent questions, mention the statistics you cited that have been highly quoted now and frequently quoted in your Omaha, Nebraska, speech back earlier this year, something that I have repeated over and over again to people, and that is the declining number of union households in the country as also being a major factor in what has happened in income disparity. I thought it was very interesting statistics, just looking at the data at what had happened. And of course, knowing that a lot of those gains that the middle-class acquired were not necessarily given out freely but negotiated rather extensively and intensively to produce the incomes, the working conditions, the hours, and so forth that raised those levels so that people moved into that income category that allowed them to purchase and to do the other things that middle-income people have historically done. You may have mentioned that and, if you did, I may have missed it. But I thought it was a very worthwhile observation you made, among others, as to what had happened over this gap that has grown now 82 years. Great questions.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, welcome. It is good to see you again. Thank your coming and joining us today, and for your service. Others have asked about the subprime mortgage market. I want to just touch briefly on that as we start out here. Yesterday, we tried to have a hearing in this same room on FHA reauthorization. In my opening statement yesterday, I mentioned that if you look at the increase in the subprime mortgage market it really mirrors the decrease of FHA's market presence for subprime lending. The Administration has come to us with the recommendation, a series of recommendations, on how to change things in the FHA program. I just wanted to ask if you have any thoughts on what might be an appropriate course for us?",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR THOMAS R. CARPER
"Chairman Bernanke","The FHA's market share is declining quite radically, as I am sure you know, down to about 3 percent.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Actually, I think they reported it about 6, down from about 14 to 6 just in the last couple of years or something like that.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","So there is clearly less reliance on the FHA than in the past. My sense is that part of the problem is lack of flexibility, costs of dealing with the FHA, lack of diversity of products and so on. So, I think that modernizing the FHA and trying to make it more responsive, easier for ultimate lenders to work with and so on, might reverse this trend and might give the FHA a larger share in the market which could be a positive thing. I guess I would point out that the FHA, if I remember correctly, still has a fairly high delinquency and default rate and it has not solved the problem of delinquencies and so on. And so as those changes get made, I would suggest moving with some caution to make sure that we do not create yet another source of problems in terms of inappropriate loans for specific borrowers. So, I do see a case for trying to make the FHA more modern and to expand its role. But I would urge some caution and go slow on that.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Thank you. When you were before us, I believe a year or so ago, I raised the issue of concern expressed by domestic auto manufacturers with regards to alleged manipulation of currency by not China but by the Japanese. I think you indicated in your response that as far as we can tell, at least since the earlier part of this decade, the Japanese have not been manipulating their currency. Since that time we have had a huge debate here in the U.S. Senate about whether or not we should raise fuel efficiency requirements for cars, trucks, and vans built in this country, to do that over the next 13 years or so. The domestic auto industry has come back to us and said please do not raise CAFE standards dramatically. If you do, you will push us closer to being out of business. They said do something about the Japanese currency manipulation. They said do something about our legacy costs, particularly health costs for employees and for pensioners. And they call on us to provide some Federal investments in plants, in their plans to enable them to move toward flexible manufacturing where they would make more than just one or two products in a plant. I am not going to ask you to comment on all of those but I would be interested in your thoughts again on alleged manipulation by the Japanese of their currency. A year ago you suggested that it had not been done for several years, and I just wanted to ask your views on that today.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","There has not been any changes to my knowledge. The last time that the Japanese intervened was in-- as far as we know, was in March 2004 and there has not been a subsequent intervention since then. The yen has been quite weak reflecting in large part the fact that interest rates in Japan are quite low, which in turn reflects the policies of the Bank of Japan in the face of still very low, near deflation, inflation rates. I view the end as being essentially a market determined exchange rate and I think that market determined rates are the way to go. And so I would not advocate any particular policy changes with respect to Japan.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Thank you. Are you alarmed at all by our growing reliance on foreign oil?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","It is certainly an issue. We now import about two-thirds of our oil. We are very heavily reliant on oil. It would be very desirable for us to have a more diversified energy portfolio. I think there are ways to do that. As a very basic approach, I could suggest three things. One is that the Government has a very substantial role and has been very effective in the past in promoting or doing basic research, developing alternative technologies either in terms of conservation or new energy sources. A second issue is what I guess I would call regulatory certainty. We do not get new refineries, we do not get nuclear plants, not so much because the regulations per se are so onerous but because between the uncertainty of how they will be applied and legal suits and so on nobody wants to undertake a new investment. So it is fine to have strong regulations to protect the environment and achieve other social goals but it would be productive to have a system whereby people who want to make investments in alternative energy forms or refineries, et cetera, would know in advance what they have to do in order to meet the regulatory requirements. The third thing I would say is that although the high energy prices and high oil prices we are seeing right now, of course are very painful, and I do not want to downplay that in any way, they do have at least the benefit that they make a lot of other alternatives potentially economically viable. With regulatory certainty and basic research, among other things, that market I think can begin to deliver some alternatives. We do have to address issues related to the environment and global warming and the like. But I think there are really a large number of possible alternatives and we should let the economy explore those.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Thank you. Those are excellent points. The last question. In the past you have been vocal in your support for reforming our Government Sponsored Enterprises, at least the regulation of those. I think you actually gave a speech back in March that dwelled on that. I guess my question is we seem to be hung up. The House has passed a bill, we are expecting to take up legislation later this year that addresses GSE reform and regulation of our Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Federal Home Loan Banks. The hang up appears to be really in two areas: What kind of support should we provide for low-income housing through some kind of creation of a low-income housing fund? And the questions about the mortgage portfolio and what kind of constraints should be on the mortgage portfolio? Any advice that you would have for us as we approach that?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","The Federal Reserve's concern is about financial stability. And so we have not taken a position on the housing fund type things. But for financial stability purposes, I think there are three elements: Strong bank-like capital powers. Second, well- defined receivership positions so that if a GSE goes out of business we know under what circumstances that would happen and what the resolution of that would be. And third, anchoring the portfolio in a public purpose. Right now, it can expand almost at will and it is not tied directly to public purpose. In my speech that you referred to, I advocated tying the portfolio to affordable housing or to housing goals in some explicit way. So those are the recommendations that I would suggest in order to assure us, in terms of our concern which is about the implications for financial stability if these large portfolios were to come under financial stress.",Speech,
"Senator Carper","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Senator Carper, thank you.",Speech,
"Senator Akaka","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Bernanke, it is good to see you in person here. And I want to tell you my role here on the Banking Committee has come down to being very concerned about the consumers of America. Here I have looked upon this as trying to improve the quality of life for consumers, as well as to help them improve themselves. Consumer protection is important, and also equipping them with the skills and knowledge that will help them with their understandings and also to empower them with economic empowerment. So this area has been important to me. Our modern complex economy depends on the ability of consumers to make informed financial decisions. Without a sufficient understanding of economics and personal finance, individuals will not be able to appropriately manage their finances, evaluate credit opportunities, and successfully invest for long-term financial goals in an increasingly complex marketplace. Mr. Chairman, I really appreciate your personal involvement on the important issues of financial literacy. I also wanted to take the time to thank all of the Federal Reserve employees, and I want to include Sandy Bronstein in that, and all of those who have taken such an active role in helping improve the financial knowledge of consumers and evaluating the effectiveness of education programs. As you know, approximately 10 million households in the United States do not have accounts at mainstream financial institutions. Unfortunately, too many of these households depend on high cost fringe financial services. They miss out on opportunities for saving, borrowing, and lower cost remittances found at credit unions and banks. And so the unbanked has become one of my concerns. My question to you is what must be done to bring these households into mainstream financial institutions?",Statement,STATEMENT OF SENATOR DANIEL K. AKAKA
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, first let me say that I agree wholeheartedly with your views on financial literacy. As I discussed earlier, the Federal Reserve works very hard on all these disclosures for these sometimes complex financial products. But if people do not have the basic literacy to understand them and evaluate them, it is really of no use. Without financial literacy they are not going to be able to participate fully in our economy. In terms of bringing more people into the banking system, I think it would be a positive development. The main way the Federal Reserve can help that process is what we do, which is to encourage the banks and bank holding companies that we supervise to reach out into underserved communities, partly through the Community Reinvestment Act but more generally to provide services and to try to attract unbanked people into the banking system. I have given not only testimony before the Senate on financial literacy, but I have also given some testimony in the past on remittances which is one mechanism. Many of the remittances that immigrants send back home, they lose a significant portion of the money they are sending because of the high cost of the types of services they use and other problems. One of the ways in which credit unions and banks have made inroads into the minority communities, in particular, has been by offering better and cheaper remittance services. I think that is one particular way to get in. But we are seeing banks more and more employing Spanish speaking, for example, tellers and understanding that there really is a good market in these low and moderate income neighborhoods. And we encourage banks to provide services in those neighborhoods.",Speech,
"Senator Akaka","Mr. Chairman, FDIC has found that their Money Smart financial literacy program has resulted in positive behavioral change among consumers. I know that measuring the effectiveness of financial literacy programs is an issue that the Federal Reserve has been interested in for several years. What has the Federal Reserve learned thus far about the effectiveness of financial education?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","First, a lot of what we do is partner with various groups. The Chicago Federal Reserve Bank partners with the Money Smart group that you just referred to. So a lot of what we do is try to develop best practice and to try and spread that to schools and to nonprofit organizations and so on. In terms of what we learned, we are still, I think--and here I am referring to the entire education community--groping with how best to teach financial literacy at the school level. There is an organization called JumpStart which does testing of kids in high school. Unfortunately, the progress on financial literacy there has not been all that we would like. One place, however, where we do see more progress, and I referred to this in my discussion with Senator Schumer, is that when potential homebuyers receive counseling nearer to the time when they are going to be making their decisions that they do learn and they do understand and it does affect their decisions, as you might expect, because they are very highly motivated at that point to understand the terms of the contract that they are about to enter into. So it is still a very open issue. We have a website which includes lots and lots of materials which have been tested in various contexts. But I cannot say that there is, at this point, a definitive approach. I think you have to take a little bit of this, a little bit of that, and mix it all together and recognize that financial literacy is not just a school subject. It really has to be used throughout life because it is really, as you get older and you have to worry about buying a house and sending your kids to college and retirement, that you really begin to think hard about these financial issues. Kids in the 10th grade may not be as motivated to think about them.",Speech,
"Senator Akaka","I thank you so much for your responses. My time has expired, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you very much, Senator Akaka. These are very important questions and I thank you for raising them. Your point about the 10 million households without access to mainstream financial institutions is a very legitimate concern and something I have talked a lot about myself. The Chairman points out that the cost of this to these people, because they are using financial services, and it will cost an average person thousands of dollars more than they would otherwise pay if they were dealing with mainstream financial institutions. So the cost differentials are huge, not to mention, of course, the ability for people in those circumstances to improve their economic lot. So, I thank you for raising it. I, too, find it remarkable, from the time a young person enters a traditional schooling system in this country through the 12th grade there is not a single requirement that I know of anywhere that there is some period of time in which just basic financial services literacy would be required. We have talked a lot about this and schools are inundated with requests and demands on them. They do not want to hear about another one. But one of the major problems is people's inability to understand basic financial obligations. So, I thank you for raising and thank you, Mr. Chairman, for your comments.",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","A few States, Senator, have actually made these requirements but it is not universal.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Have they done that? That is good to hear. Let me turn to Senator Shelby for one question. I have one additional one after his and then we will complete the hearing.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","Thank you. Chairman Bernanke, GSE reform. We have talked about this before. This Committee has been interested in strengthening the regulatory system for the housing related Government Sponsored Enterprises for a number of years. The House recently, as you are probably aware, considered language giving the new proposed regulator the ability to regulate the size and the growth of the enterprise portfolios and charged the regulator to consider risk of the portfolios. However the language, which was amended on the House floor, I understand, which passed in the House, limited the risk consideration to only risk to the enterprises. Would you view this language, as it was passed by the House as amended on the floor, with what bank regulators have over financial institutions? That is do you consider, as a regulator, only the risk to a particular financial institution? Or do you look at the portfolio? Do you look at other things? The portfolio your predecessor, Chairman Greenspan, says right here in this Committee and I believe you have reiterated that there is risk there in that portfolio, possibly to the taxpayer. Would you comment on this?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, I am aware of this legislation and the amendment. The amendment in the House does concern me greatly because I think it eliminates the ability of the regulator to take the financial system's stability overall into account. So in particular, one might imagine a situation where greatly increasing the size of the GSE portfolio is in the interest of the company but raises the risk to the overall system. As I said a moment ago, in my role my principal concern is about the stability of the overall system. And I fear that without some consideration of the overall financial stability implications, that this new regulation would be incomplete.",Speech,
"Senator Shelby","I think there are some good things in the House-passed bill but that was not one of them, in my judgment. I appreciate your comment. Thank you, Chairman Dodd.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Thank you, Senator Shelby. And just on that point alone, obviously we are going to looking at that and trying to get a bill done fairly soon. Again, the realization here, I just have to add two cents on this. And that is, of course, the presence of the GSEs in this area, I think many would agree, have created a possibility. One of the unique opportunities we offer in our economy is that 30-year more fixed rate mortgage which provides great stability and great wealth creation for an awful lot of people, in the absence of which it would be very difficult to achieve. So striking the balance here, the points you have raised here, and seeing to it we do not move away from the opportunity that those vehicles provide is something very important to all of us. Let me raise a quick question if I can, as well, with you here. The hedge fund industry is obviously an important wealth creator in the country. It has done an awful lot of worthwhile things in terms of a valuable role in capital markets. The President's Working Group, which you are a part of, back in February released a set of principles and guidelines. I would just quote, it says ``To guide U.S. financial regulators as they address public policy issues associated with the rapid growth of the private pools of capital, including hedge funds. The agreement concentrates on investor protection and systemic risk concerns.'' The President's Working Group, at that point, determined that additional regulation was not needed. Let me raise the issue that has been raised by others. You had a piece in the Chicago Tribune recently talking about the Amaranth situation, which many people pointed out, given the size of it, it did not create that much of a bubble unless you were in San Diego and had a pension fund and then $100 million was lost. So from your perspective, from stepping back from a macro standpoint, it had seemingly very little effect. And yet if you were dealing with the pensions in San Diego, it was a rather significant effect. There was then a story in, I think it was Business Week, that I was not aware of. A lot of smaller colleges are now moving aggressively into hedge funds, according to this article. It identified colleges that had invested between 60 and 82 percent of their endowments in hedge funds. They said they may be putting their endowments in jeopardy. That was the conclusion of this Business Week article. Again, they are just two newspaper stories here. I just wonder, in light of all of this, do you have any additional recommendations about this? What did the President's Working Group want market participants to do differently after the release of the principles than they were doing before? How were the Working Group agencies overseeing the impact of this new guidance that they put out? And last, do you feel that additional regulation of hedge funds is needed to avoid concerns about systemic risk?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, the essence of making the market discipline approach work is that the counterparties, investors, and creditors be sophisticated and able to evaluate the investments that they are undertaking. In the case of a pension fund, the pension fund manager has a fiduciary duty to make investments which are appropriate for the risk/return needs of that fund. So if that fiduciary manager has sufficient sophistication to use some of these things, that perhaps is OK. But in most cases I think that pension funds should probably not go heavily into these types of instruments. In fact, on average, ERISA funds have relatively small shares of their assets in these funds. But again, in those cases and in the cases of endowments as well, it is really the responsibility of the sophisticated managers to make sure that they are making the right risk/return trade-offs. The whole system depends on those people knowing what they are doing.",Speech,
"Chairman Dodd","Given the exposures you were talking about, and I agree with that totally. I do not disagree with what you said. Do we, you, and these other appropriate agencies bear an additional responsibility here to be more mindful of what is going on, including possibly some regulatory role here?",Speech,
"Chairman Bernanke","With respect to the pension funds, for example, they already are regulated by ERISA and the Department of Labor. And they have fiduciary responsibilities and that should be enforced, obviously. In terms of the broader issue of market discipline for private pools of capital, I would like to emphasize that this is not a laissez-faire approach. In particular the supervisors, including the Federal Reserve, have the responsibility to make sure that the institutions who are the prime brokers, the counterparties, the creditors of these private pools of capital, that they have in place adequate risk measurement techniques, risk management techniques, they have enough information so they can make adequate assessments of the risks that they are facing. So we, in fact, do put a lot of effort into ensuring that these institutions--and I say we, this is in collaboration with the SEC and other regulators--that they are doing sufficient due diligence to protect themselves and their own investors and depositors from excessive risk. So that is what makes the system work, a combination of self-interested counterparty market discipline but overseen and overlaid by effective supervisory attention.",Speech,
