Speaker,Speech
Chairman Dodd," Well, good morning. Let me welcome my colleagues and others to this very important hearing this morning. I want to thank the Chairman of the Federal Reserve.
    Today we are meeting in the most unusual and extraordinary moments in many ways in the recent history of our country. Let me tell you how we are going to proceed this morning.
    This is, of course, a scheduled hearing with the Chairman of the Federal Reserve on Humphrey-Hawkins and dealing with monetary policy, and over the next hour or so, we are going to focus on that and give the Chairman an opportunity to give us his statement this morning on that statutorily mandated requirement to appear before the Committee and share his thoughts on this issue. And then, as I understand it, we are due to have a vote around 11 o'clock, and my hope would be that we would recess for a few minutes for that vote, and when we come back, the Secretary of the Treasury, Hank Paulson, and Christopher Cox, the Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, will be with us to engage in a discussion of the financial services issues that are before us.
    I want to thank Senator Shelby and my colleagues here for waiving the normal requirements of having several days of notice before we actually have a hearing like this. But I think all of us recognize the significance of the issues that are going on in our country at this moment and the importance of having the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the SEC as well as the Chairman of the Federal Reserve to be with us this morning. So I am very grateful to you and to the Secretary of the Treasury and Chris Cox.
    So the first hearing will be to receive the Semiannual Monetary Policy Report from the Federal Reserve as previously scheduled, and after the conclusion of that hearing, we will convene a second hearing on Recent Developments in U.S. Financial Markets and Regulatory Responses to Them. The second hearing was noticed yesterday with the consent of Senator Shelby--and, again, I am grateful to him--due to the special and exigent circumstances in our Nation's financial markets.
    I want to thank Chairman Bernanke for testifying at both hearings. I also thank Secretary Paulson and Chairman Cox for agreeing to appear on very short notice at the second hearing. In deference to them and the importance of the matters at hand, I will provide a brief opening statement. I will ask Senator Shelby to do likewise. And then I would ask my fellow Members here if they would reserve their question period to make their opening statements. All statements will be included in the record as if read so that we can get to the statement by the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and then get to the questions as quickly as we can.
    In considering the state of our economy and, in particular, the turmoil in recent days, it is important to distinguish between fear and facts. In our markets today, far too many actions are being driven by fear and ignoring crucial facts. One such fact is that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have core strengths that are helping them weather the stormy seas of today's financial markets. They are adequately capitalized. They are able to access the debt markets. They have solid portfolios with relatively few risky subprime mortgages. They are well regulated, and they have played a vital role in maintaining the flow of affordable mortgage credit even during these volatile times.
    Another fact is that the subprime lending fiasco was preventable. In this Committee, 18 months of exhaustive hearings have documented what I have called a ``pattern of regulatory neglect.'' The previous leadership, along with other financial agency leaders appointed by this administration, in my view ignored the clear and present danger posed by predatory lending to homeowners, to financial institutions, and to the economy as a whole. The result of this neglect is that the American people are experiencing unprecedented hardships and uncertainties.
    Foreclosure rates continue at record levels. Each and every day in America, more than 8,000 families enter foreclosure. For those lucky enough to keep their homes, the value of their homes has dropped by the greatest amount in some cases since the Great Depression. Millions more are paying record-high prices for gasoline, for health care, for education, and even for the food that they put on their tables. They are watching the value of their pension funds and 401(k)s plummet. And they want to know when will things start to turn around, when will America get back on track.
    Chairman Bernanke, you are to be commended, in my view, for your efforts to bring greater stability to our financial system during an unprecedented period of volatility. You also deserve credit for your willingness to address some of the unsafe, unsound, and predatory practices that proliferated over the last several years in the subprime mortgage market, as well as in the credit card lending. And we look forward to hearing from you today about the outlook for the Nation's economy and what can be done to improve it.
    Certainly, this Committee has worked diligently in that regard. On Friday evening, the Senate passed, with an overwhelming bipartisan majority, a bill that we believe will assist homeowners at risk of foreclosure, establish a new, permanent affordable housing fund, modernize the FHA, strengthen the regulation of the GSEs, and help restore confidence to the mortgage markets as a whole. It is certainly my view that this legislation deserves to be enacted as soon as possible, and I hope that will occur.
    In addition, we are all by now aware that the Treasury and the SEC as well as the Fed made important policy announcements this past weekend, which we intend to examine carefully in the hearing later this morning with you, Mr. Chairman, Secretary Paulson, and Chairman Cox.
    I think I can speak for everyone, I hope, on this Committee in saying that we all share a common desire to promote the common good of our country, and I think we all certainly appreciate the spirit in which the Fed, the SEC, and the Treasury Department have acted. But we do them and the American people a disservice if we do not examine very carefully the proposals that are being put forward. That is particularly true of the Treasury proposals. It is in many respects unprecedented. Although limited in duration, these proposals would give the Treasury unlimited new authority to purchase GSE debt and equity, it would exempt those purchases from pay-as-you-go budget rules, and it would grant to the Federal Reserve considerable new powers in relation to the regulation of the GSEs. These new powers could have the effect of crippling the efforts of virtually every Member of this Committee to create a true world-class regulator for the GSEs.
    These proposals raise serious questions--questions about the nature of the economic crisis facing our Nation, about the ability of these proposals to address this crisis effectively, and about the burden to the American taxpayer potentially being asked to carry. These questions deserve serious answers.
    Above all, this is a time to act on the basis of fact and not fear, as I said at the outset of these remarks. For too many years, leaders have shirked their duty, in my view, to protect the American taxpayer and to promote the American economy. At this critical moment, we must not flinch from our duty to do the same.
    With that, let me turn to Senator Shelby.
             STATEMENT OF SENATOR RICHARD C. SHELBY
    Senator Shelby. Mr. Chairman, I ask that my whole statement be made part of the record.
"
Chairman Dodd," Without objection, it will be.
    Senator Shelby. Chairman Bernanke, we again welcome you to the Banking Committee. We know this is a stressful time for our country, for our banking system, and perhaps for the Federal Reserve. We welcome you to deliver the Federal Reserve's Semiannual Monetary Policy Report, as you are required by law to do.
    I will keep my remarks brief and wait for Secretary Paulson and also SEC Chairman Cox to join you. But we are all interested in your views on the economy, where the economy is going to go, more than the specter of inflation, but other issues, related issues, such as the GSE situation.
    A lot of us--and you have raised this issue, your Chairman raised this issue over 5 years ago in this Committee. A lot of us realized that the GSEs were not properly regulated and were thinly capitalized. We have seen this come home now. They were fears that we hoped would not come, but they are here today.
    I guess the situation is some said always that the GSEs, because of the implicit guarantee of the Government, with over $5 trillion of debt, exceeding that of France and the U.K. combined, that it was a ticking time bomb. Well, someone has started the fuse burning. I hope it is not too little or too late. But I believe this is an opportune time to rein in the GSEs.
    Senator Dodd has talked about this a lot: We realize they are important to our housing, they are important to our economy, but they have to be capitalized well. They have got to be managed well, and they have got to be regulated. And I hope later in the morning we will get into that. I think that is one of the topics of the day after your monetary policy report.
    Thank you, Senator Dodd.
"
Chairman Dodd," With that, Mr. Chairman, we welcome your comments, and your statement in full will be included in the record.
            STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE, CHAIRMAN,
        BOARD OF GOVERNORS OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM
"
Mr. Bernanke," Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.
    The U.S. economy and financial system has confronted some significant challenges thus far in 2008. The contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions. The effects of the housing contraction and of the financial head winds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation.
    Against this backdrop, economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year while inflation has remained elevated. Following a significant reduction in its policy rate over the second half of 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee eased policy considerably further through the spring to counter actual and expected weakness in economic growth and to mitigate downside risk to economic activity. In addition, the Federal Reserve expanded some of the special liquidity programs that were established last year and implemented additional facilities to support the functioning of financial markets and foster financial stability.
    Although these policy actions have had positive effects, the economy continues to face numerous difficulties, including ongoing strains on financial markets, declining house prices, a softening labor market, and rising prices of oil, food, and some other commodities.
    Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of some of these key issues.
    Developments in financial markets and their implications to the macroeconomic outlook have been a focus of monetary policymakers over the past year. In the second half of 2007, the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the United States triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type.
    In the first quarter of 2008, reports of further losses and writedowns by financial institutions intensified investor concerns and resulted in further sharp reductions in market liquidity. By March, many dealers and other institutions, even those that had relied heavily on short-term secured financing, were facing much more stringent borrowing conditions.
    In mid-March, a major investment bank, the Bear Stearns Companies Incorporated, was pushed to the brink of failure after suddenly losing access to short-term financing markets. The Federal Reserve judged that a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns would pose a serious threat to overall financial stability and would most likely have significant adverse implications for the U.S. economy. After discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in consultation with the Treasury, we invoked emergency authorities to provide special financing to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase and Company.
    In addition, the Federal Reserve used emergency authorities to establish two new facilities to provide backstop liquidity to primary dealers, with the goals of stabilizing financial conditions and increasing the availability of credit to the broader economy.
    We have also taken additional steps to address liquidity pressures in the banking system, including a further easing of the terms for bank borrowing at the discount window and increases in the amount of credit made available to banks through the Term Auction Facility.
    The FOMC also authorized expansion of its currency swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to facilitate increased dollar lending by those institutions to banks in their jurisdictions.
    These steps to address liquidity pressures, coupled with monetary easing, seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains. During the second quarter, credit spreads generally narrowed, liquidity pressures ebbed, and a number of financial institutions raised new capital. However, as events in recent weeks have demonstrated, many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy and, thus, for credit quality remains uncertain.
    In recent days, investors became particularly concerned about the financial condition of the Government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In view of this development, and given the importance of these firms to the mortgage market, the Treasury announced the legislative proposal to bolster their capital, access to liquidity, and regulatory oversight.
    As a supplement to the Treasury's existing authority to lend to the GSEs, and as a bridge to the time when the Congress decides how to proceed on these matters, the Board of Governors authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should that become necessary. Any lending would be collateralized by U.S. Government and Federal agency securities. In general, healthy economic growth depends on well-functioning financial markets. Consequently, helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the Federal Reserve.
    I turn now to current economic developments and prospects. The economy has continued to expand, but at a subdued pace. In the labor market, private payroll employment has declined this year, falling at an average pace of 94,000 jobs per month through June. Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors has been particularly hard hit, although employment declines in a number of other sectors are evident as well. The unemployment rate has risen and now stands at 5.5 percent.
    In the housing sector, activity continues to weaken. Although sales of existing homes have been unchanged this year, sales of new homes have continued to fall, and inventories of unsold new homes remain high. In response, home builders continue to scale back the pace of housing starts. Home prices are falling, particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade. The declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures. By adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale, these foreclosures have in turn intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas.
    Personal consumption expenditures have advanced at a modest pace so far this year, generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes. In particular, with the labor market softening and consumer price inflation elevated, real earnings have been stagnant so far this year. Declining values and equities in house have taken their toll on household balance sheets, credit conditions have tightened, and indicators of consumer sentiment have fallen sharply. More positively, the fiscal stimulus package is providing some timely support to household incomes. Overall, consumption spending seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters.
    In the business sector, real outlays for equipment and software were about flat in the first quarter of the year, and construction of nonresidential structures slowed appreciably. In the second quarter, the available data suggests that business fixed investment appears to have expanded moderately. Nevertheless, surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment, including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit, and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year. However, strong export growth continues to be a significant boon to many U.S. companies.
    In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and reserve bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2008 through 2010. On balance, most FOMC participants expected that, over the remainder of this year, output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate, primarily because of continued weakness in housing markets, elevated energy prices, and tight credit conditions. Growth is projected to pick up gradually over the next 2 years as residential construction bottoms out and begins a slow recovery and as credit conditions gradually improve. However, FOMC participants indicated that considerable uncertainty surrounded their outlook for economic growth, and they viewed the risks to their forecast as skewed to the downside.
    Inflation has remained high, running at nearly a 3.5-percent annual rate over the first 5 months of this year, as measured by the price index of personal consumption expenditures. And with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks, inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term. The elevated level of overall consumer inflation largely reflects a continued sharp run-up in the prices of many commodities, especially oil, but also certain crops and metals. The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil soared about 60 percent in 2007 and thus far this year has climbed an additional 50 percent or so.
    The price of oil currently stands at about 5 times its level toward the beginning of this decade. Our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets.
    Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in demand for oil. Moreover, growth has been concentrated in developed and emerging market economies, where energy consumption has been further stimulated by rapid industrialization and by government subsidies that hold down the price of energy faced by ultimate users.
    On the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years. Much of the subdued supply response reflects inadequate investment and production shortfalls in politically volatile regions where large portions of the world's oil reserves are located. Additionally, many governments have been tightening their control over oil resources, impeding foreign investment and hindering efforts to boost capacity and production. Finally, sustainable rates of production in some of the more secure and accessible oil fields, such as those in the North Sea, have been declining.
    In view of these factors, estimates of long-term oil supplies have been marked down in recent months. Long-dated oil future prices have risen along with spot prices, suggesting that market participants also see oil supply conditions remaining tight for years to come.
    The decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat to the increase in oil prices. The precise size of this effect is difficult to ascertain as the causal relationships between oil prices and the dollar are complex and run in both directions. However, the price of oil has risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that factors other than the dollar--notably, shifts in the underlying global demand for and supply of oil--have been the principal drivers of these increases in prices.
    Another concern that has been raised is that financial speculation has added markedly to upward pressure on oil prices. Certainly, investor interest in oil and other commodities has increased substantially of late. However, if financial speculation is pushing oil prices above the levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But, in fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines over the past year.
    This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of futures markets, only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term.
    Although the inflationary effect of rising oil and agricultural commodity prices is evident in the retail prices of energy and food, the extent to which the high prices of oil and other raw materials have passed through to the prices of non-energy, non-food finished goods and services seems thus far to have been limited. But with businesses facing persistently higher input prices, they may attempt to pass through such costs into prices of final goods and services more aggressively than they have done so far.
    Moreover, as the foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined, rises in import prices have put greater upward pressure on business costs and consumer prices. In their economic projections for the June FOMC meeting, monetary policymakers marked up their forecasts for inflation during 2008 as a whole. FOMC participants continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010 as slower global growth leads to a pooling of commodity markets, as pressures on resource utilization decline, and as longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. However, in light of persistent escalation of commodity prices in recent quarters, FOMC participants view the inflation outlook as unusually uncertain and cited the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise as an important risk to the inflation forecast.
    Moreover, the currently high level of inflation, if sustained, might lead the public to revise up its expectations for longer-term inflation. If that were to occur and those revised expectations were to become embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process, we could see an unwelcome rise in actual inflation over the longer term. A critical responsibility of monetary policymakers is to prevent that process from taking hold.
    At present, accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policymakers. The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions, and a still deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth. At the same time, upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pick-up in inflation, and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher.
    Given the high degree of uncertainty, monetary policymakers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth. In light of the increase in upside inflation risk, we must be particularly alert to any indications, such as erosion of longer-term inflation expectations, that the inflationary impulses from commodity prices are becoming embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process.
    I would like to conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on some of the Federal Reserve's actions in the area of consumer protection.
    At the time of our report last February, I described the Board's proposal to adopt comprehensive new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market using our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994. After reviewing more than 4,500 comment letters we received on these proposed rules, the Board approved the final rules yesterday. The new rules apply to all types of mortgage lenders and will establish lending standards aimed at curbing abuses while preserving responsible subprime lending and sustainable homeownership.
    The final rules prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments and require lenders to verify the income and assets on which they rely when making the credit decision. Also, for higher-priced loans, lenders now will be required to establish escrow accounts so that property taxes and insurance costs will be included in consumers' regular monthly payments.
    The final rules also prohibit prepayment penalties for higher-priced loans in cases in which the consumer's payment could increase during the first few years and restrict prepayment penalties on other higher-priced loans. Other measures address the coercion of appraisers' service or practices and other issues. We believe the new rules will help to restore confidence in the mortgage market.
    In May, working jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, the Board issued proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive practices for credit card accounts and overdraft protection plans. Credit cards provide a convenient source of credit for many consumers, but as the terms of credit card loans have become more complex, transparency has been reduced.
    Our consumer testing has persuaded us that disclosures alone cannot solve this problem. Thus, the Board's proposed rules will require card issuers to alter their practices in ways that will allow consumers to better understand how their own decisions and actions will affect their costs. Card issuers would be prohibited from increasing interest rates retroactively to cover prior purchases, except under very limited circumstances. For accounts having multiple interest rates, when consumers seek to pay down their balance by paying more than the minimum, card issuers would be prohibited from maximizing interest charges by applying excess payments to the lowest-rate balance first.
    The proposed rules dealing with bank overdraft services seek to give consumers greater control by ensuring that they have ample opportunity to opt out of automatic payments of overdrafts. The Board has already received more than 20,000 comment letters in response to these proposed rules.
    Thank you very much. I would be pleased to take your questions.
"
Chairman Dodd," Well, thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. And let me just briefly say I appreciate the efforts of the Fed regarding both credit cards and the things dealing with predatory lending practices. We welcome those rules, and we welcome the suggestions in the credit card areas, and a future point here, we will maybe have more discussion about that. But I wanted to at least reflect my appreciation of what the Fed has done regarding those matters, and we appreciate it very much.
    I am going to put this clock on at 5 minutes so we can give everyone a chance to raise any questions they have on the monetary policy issues. Some of the questions may overlap, and at the conclusion of that, Secretary Paulson and Chairman Cox will be here to have a broader discussion about the proposals being made by Treasury over the weekend.
    Let me, if I can, jump to the economic projections for 2009, the concerns about economic growth that you have raised in your statement here this morning. Given the fact that we have, as you point out, acknowledged the risk to your forecast for economic growth are skewed to the downside, to use your words, and given the fact that the stimulus package is about to--the effects of it are going to run out by the end of the year. The housing crisis continues, obviously, as we all know painfully. Gasoline prices, as you point out, are at record levels, costing consumers tremendously. The issues involving the weakness in the labor market are significant, 94,000 jobs lost every month for the last 6 months on a consistent basis. Inflation, as you point out, while it may abate in the coming years, it certainly is going to be with us for some time.
    What suggestions do you have for us in all of this? And I realize you may want to reserve some final judgment on the effects of the stimulus package and will not know the full effects of that until maybe toward the end of the year. But as we look down the road as policy setters here in the Congress looking at ideas, including a possibly a second stimulus package, one of the suggestions we made to increase productivity is to invest more heavily in infrastructure, the infrastructure needs of the country.
    I wonder if you might just share with us your views as to what ideas, as a menu of ideas, without necessarily embracing one or the other, but what you would be planning to do rather than just sort of waiting out the year and a new administration coming in, we will be leaving here, adjourning in late September, early October, maybe coming back, maybe not until after inauguration of the President late in January, it seems to me this would be an opportune time for us to be considering very seriously policy considerations that would provide for greater economic growth and opportunity than what we are presently looking at.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Mr. Chairman, I think that the central issue in the economic situation right now is the housing market. It is the continued uncertainty about house prices and housing activity which is creating financial stress, is affecting consumer wealth and consumer expectations and causing the stress we are seeing in the economy. So my suggestion would be in the near term to focus on issues related to housing. I understand that you have already passed a bill that would address, for example, GSE reform. We need the GSEs to continue to be active in supporting the mortgage markets, as well as FHA modernization and other steps that Congress determines would strengthen and support mortgage finance in the housing sector. I think that is the most critical central issue we face.
    On a second stimulus package, my own sense is that we are still trying to assess the effects of the first round. It appears that it does seem to be helping. But it might be a bit more time before we fully understand the extent to which additional stimulus may or may not be needed.
    If additional stimulus is, in fact, invoked, it would be important to find programs that would be, as in the first round, timely, temporary, and targeted, in particular, that would take place quickly and would put money into the economy relatively quickly.
    In the case of infrastructure, it is often well justified on its merits, but one would have to ask whether the flow of funding would go into the economy in a relatively prompt way, or would there be long delays associated with the planning process?
"
Chairman Dodd," But your objections or concerns, they are not about the effects of that in the longer term but more the near-term benefits of it.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Addressing the infrastructure issue in the United States is very important since infrastructure is a critical part of the economic underpinnings. But except for those cases where the infrastructure spending would have immediate impact on total spending, I would suggest that those projects be evaluated on their own merits in terms of their ability to contribute to the overall strength of the economy in the longer term.
"
Chairman Dodd," I have a last question for you dealing with gasoline prices, and, again, let me first of all commend you because you did something different than your predecessor. In the past, we have excluded in the consideration of inflation gasoline or energy pricing and food. And if you do not drive a car, heat your home, or put food on the table, I suppose that has some relevance here. And I understand the macroeconomic value of excluding energy and food. But for average Americans, excluding those two necessities hardly reflects real inflation. And so the fact that you are now adding those to real inflation is very welcome, and I thank you for it.
    I wonder if you might comment briefly on the notion, how is it--and I understand your points about demand in the country and around the world and supply issues. But it strikes many of us here in the speculation area, and you said the need to look at transparency issues and the like are warranted. But it seems to me in 1 year's time to go from $60 or $70 a barrel to this morning I think it is hovering around $150 a barrel has to be explained in terms other than just normal economic pressures that it created.
    Does it concern you at all about margin requirements, for instance, in the area of speculation where the margin requirements are somewhat different in the area of energy pricing than they are for other commodities that there should be some leveling of the playing field when it comes to margin requirements, as an example of what might come as a response?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I would just like to comment briefly that the Federal Reserve and the CFTC are part of a task force which is gathering data analyzing these issues and hope to bring some more explicit recommendations to you later this summer or early fall.
    Margin requirements serve two purposes. They can affect the cost of credit, but they also are a very important part of the counterparty risk management process for exchanges. And so we need to be careful in changing margin requirements that we do not interfere with these other important functions or that we do not unnecessarily reduce the liquidity in those markets. But we are certainly looking at these issues, and we hoped that they would bring to you some ideas.
"
Chairman Dodd," You will be looking at that one specifically, the margin requirement issue. Is that----
"
Mr. Bernanke," We will be looking specifically at the whole range of issues about transparency, practices, positions, and so on.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much.
    Senator Shelby.
    Senator Shelby. Mr. Chairman, I have a number of questions that I would like to submit for the record dealing with monetary policy.
"
Chairman Dodd," That will all be done, by the way. Any questions people have and they do not feel they have enough time on monetary policy, we will make sure the Chairman gets them.
    Senator Shelby. Chairman Bernanke, you are also a bank regulator, the Federal Reserve, and I know that you are not the primary regulator of IndyMac, which was the largest bank failure since 1984, Continental Illinois. Why did that bank fail? And could it have been prevented? What is your take on it? And is that just the beginning of a number of bank failures that you should be concerned with and we should be concerned with in this country?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, Senator, as you point out, we are not the primary regulator of that institution, but we were involved in it----
    Senator Shelby. Absolutely.
"
Mr. Bernanke," ----because the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco was attempting to assist in the wind down, and we certainly had extensive communication with the FDIC and the OTS about that bank.
    My assessment of IndyMac is that it was particularly weighted down with low-quality mortgages, subprime and other exotic mortgages, and those losses created a capital hole that it was unable to fill. So in that respect, I think its failure, barring acquisition by another firm, which did not occur, was inevitable. So, again, I think it was basically the asset quality of the bank that had that effect.
    Of course, all banks are being challenged by credit conditions now. The good news is that the banking system did come into this episode extremely well capitalized, extremely profitable. I do not have any forecast to make. I think Chairman Bair gave a good discussion yesterday about the pressures that banks are facing, and she discussed her list of problem banks.
    I suppose it is a bit of good news that most of the problem banks that she had is a far smaller list than we have seen in some episodes in the past, in the 1990s, for example.
    Senator Shelby. Overall, looking at our banking system, could you say today here in the Senate that you believe as Chairman of the Federal Reserve that our banking system is stable and capitally strong?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Our banking system is well capitalized. They came in with strong capital. We are watching the situation very carefully. My concerns have turned less on the solvency of these institutions and more on their ability to extend the credit that our economy needs to keep growing, because in many cases banks are deleveraging or shrinking or are reluctant to raise the extra capital needed to take advantage of business opportunities. So that is more my concern than solvency concerns.
    Senator Shelby. Let's briefly, because I have just got a couple of minutes, focus on the GSEs, and we will get into it more when the Treasury Secretary gets here and the Chairman of the SEC. Is this just a stopgap measure or is this a real approach to fundamentally reform the GSEs? A lot of us, you included, have been advocating that right here on this Committee for a long time. We did not have a lot of help from certain people, some of our friends, and Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have some of the most powerful lobbyists, believe me, in Washington. And I do not believe that they are going to like some of the things that I believe we have to come forth with now. But is this just a piecemeal deal? Because we have got systemic risk here. Where do we go? Will this do it, in other words, or will this just be postponing the inevitable?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, Senator, our goals at this point should be to protect the financial system, to protect the taxpayer, and to strengthen and support the housing market. There are a number of steps that we need, but I think a critical step would be----
    Senator Shelby. What are the three most important steps?
"
Mr. Bernanke," The most important step will be to get a strong, bank-like, world-class regulator that will be able to provide assurance to the public, to the taxpayer, and to the investors that these firms will be well capitalized and able to maintain and support their core mission, which is to support mortgage financing in the United States. So I would say that is job one.
    Then we need to think about what else is needed to make sure that they are, in fact, strong enough financially and there is enough confidence that they can, in fact, carry out their mission. And, again, the taxpayers' interest must be protected.
    Senator Shelby. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you.
    Senator Menendez.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke, for your testimony and your successful.
    I want to visit with you on the housing issue. In March of 2007, you said that, ``The impact on the broader economy and financial markets of the subprime market seems likely to be contained.'' And I assume you would want to change that statement today somewhat, amend it, with the ability of 20/20 hindsight.
    What do you think in the housing crisis, do you see it hitting rock bottom this year? A year from now? Because this is one of the significant challenges within the economy. What do you see on the horizon?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, first, of course, I would like to revise and extend my remarks from March of 2007. The issue was that the subprime crisis triggered a much broader retreat from credit and risk taking, which has affected not just subprime lending but a wide variety of credit instruments. And that is why it has become a much bigger element in the situation than, frankly, I anticipated at that time.
    The housing market is still under considerable stress and construction is still declining. I do believe that we will start to see stabilization in the construction of new homes sometime later this year or the beginning of next year, and that will be a benefit because the slowing construction pattern has been subtracting about 1 percentage point from the growth of the GDP going back now for some time. So that will be a benefit.
    House prices may continue to fall longer than that because of the large inventories of unsold homes that we still face. And then I would have to say that there is uncertainty about exactly what the equilibrium level that house prices will reach is. Unfortunately, it is that uncertainty, which is generating a lot of the stress and risk aversion we are seeing in financial markets.
    It is for that reason--the need to find a footing, to find stability in the housing market--that I do think that action by this Congress to support the housing market through strengthening the GSEs and FHA and so on is of vital importance.
    Senator Menendez. Let me talk about the other major driver, then, of what is happening to our economy, and that is the whole question of energy prices and oil. You know, I appreciate in your answer to the Chairman and in your testimony, because we have had testimony before the Congress by all executives who say that the difference between supply and demand over the last 2 years would largely lead us to a concern that, in fact, speculation may have driven the price of oil up an additional $50 a barrel. You have the view that that may not be the most significant thing in prices, but you do take the view that useful steps can be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of future markets.
    Are you ready to say to the Committee today what some of those useful steps are? Or are you still depending upon that Committee that you are meeting with to look at that? Because we do not have a lot of time here.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Senator, this is really the CFTC's function and responsibility. We are trying to assist them, and we are trying to work as quickly as possible to gather information and try to make some useful recommendations.
    Senator Menendez. Well, many of us believe we need to pursue market speculation now as a critical element of helping to drive down particularly gas prices. Let me ask you this: There is one thing squarely within your realm, and that is the question of a weaker dollar.
    In 2000, we ran a budget surplus. Ever since then, the Federal Government has been running up larger budget deficits. We added to that a $1.6 trillion tax cut and a $700 billion war that would generally contribute to a larger budget deficit. And if you look at that and you look at the twin deficits of both trade and the budget in combination, you have a low--with a low domestic savings rate, you have all of the makings of a weakening dollar.
    In 2002, the barrel of oil cost $23 and 23 euros. Now it costs--well, the Chairman had even a higher figure than I had. I had $145 and 90 euros. I am sure it just changed overnight.
    Do you agree with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and others that the weakening dollar has contributed to the higher price of oil as an elemental part of our challenge?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I do agree, and I said so in my testimony. It should be noted that the decline in the dollar from 2002 reversed an appreciation of the dollar that had taken place from the early 1990s until that point. And it is related to the dynamics of our trade deficit, as you alluded to.
    In the late 1990s and early 2000s, strong capital inflows drove the dollar up, but that made up less competitive and created a trade deficit. Some of that has to be unwound to bring us back toward a better balance of trade, and, in fact, we had been seeing considerable improvement in our balance of trade as the dollar reversed that increase. But we also import a lot of oil, and because we import it, when oil prices rise, that also works in the other direction. It tends to hurt the dollar. So there is really causality going in both directions.
    Senator Menendez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Senator Bennett.
    Senator Bennett. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Welcome, Chairman Bernanke. I have the same kinds of questions everybody has with respect to the deal made over the weekend for Fannie and Freddie, but I will save those for the next panel.
    Let's talk about your forecast. The GDP for the first quarter was originally forecast at six-tenths of 1 percent and then nine-tenths of 1 percent and then at 1-percent growth. It has always been raised as the data come in. We have had a bear signal on the Dow theory. I don't know whether you follow that or not, but there has been a lot of that in the newspapers, which I know you do follow that. Whether you believe the Dow theory or not, you follow it. I don't know whether you believe it or not. That is a separate issue. But, nonetheless, we have got a bear signal that says we are now in a bear market, which historically lasts for anywhere from 18 to 24, 30 months, something of that kind.
    The blue chip forecast for the second half has always been for growth--slow to be sure, relatively low to be sure, but for growth. And in your previous appearances before the Committee in this kind of a context, you have pretty much been in that same territory. Are you still there?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, as your point about the first quarter makes clear, even after the fact, it is sometimes hard to know exactly how much growth there was. Yes, our forecast calls for growth in the second half, but relatively weak. Part of what seems to have happened is that perhaps the fiscal stimulus or other factors--some of the growth that we anticipated--has been pulled forward into the second quarter, which looks to be doing somewhat better, frankly, than we anticipated. So our forecast----
    Senator Bennett. You mean pulled forward into the first quarter?
"
Mr. Bernanke," No. To the second quarter, the current--the quarter that just ended.
    Senator Bennett. Oh, yes. All right. I am second half so that is--OK. Right.
"
Mr. Bernanke," So the second quarter appears to be actually better than expected, and, therefore, our forecast for the entire year might actually be stronger than it was earlier. But with that strength having been brought forward to some extent into the second quarter, we are looking at the remainder of the year as being probably positive growth, but certainly not robust growth.
    Senator Bennett. The one thing the markets hate more than anything else is uncertainty, and I have the feeling that that is part of the problem with respect to oil prices and part of the problem with respect to the housing market.
    Now, you have suggested that the housing market might stabilize over the next 6 to 12 months so that people will begin to say, OK, we have now reached bottom and we are starting to build back up again. Do you feel that the deal that was made over the weekend with Fannie and Freddie can help eliminate some of the uncertainty and cause people to have a greater degree of confidence that the timeframe that we have been talking about will indeed come to pass?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, Senator, no deal was made. All that was done was a proposal was made to bring to Congress----
    Senator Bennett. I am using newspaper talk. I realize that is always a mistake.
"
Mr. Bernanke," But as I said earlier, I think the housing sector, together to some extent with oil, is at the heart of the current uncertainty, the current situation. I think were it to happen that there would become a general view that the housing situation had stabilized, you would see actually a very strong bounce-back in the economy and the financial markets, and it is the uncertainty about when that happens that remains a problem.
    Again, it is the Congress' prerogative to decide what to do about the GSEs and other housing-related legislation. But as I tried to indicate before, I think the best thing that we can do to remove this uncertainty and to speed the recovery is to make sure that the housing market and the mortgage finance markets are functioning as well as possible.
    Senator Bennett. Yes, but very specifically, taking away the word ``deal''--and I agree with you that even though that is the word we have seen in the press, that is probably not the right word. But the structure that you have agreed to in terms of some kind of a back-up for the GSEs, should they get in trouble, do you have the feeling that the announcement of the terms of that structure should remove some of the uncertainty with respect to their future?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Yes. I think right now that, in fact, part of the reaction in markets has to do with the uncertainty about exactly what the deal, as you call it, might look like. So if there is clarity which provides assurances that the GSEs will have the financial strength they need to support the mortgage market, and, second, as Senator Shelby emphasized, there is also a very strong regulator that will protect the system and protect the taxpayer, the combination of those two things would be very constructive.
    Senator Bennett. I think we know about the regulator. It is the other thing that people are waiting to find out about.
"
Mr. Bernanke," I think so, Senator, because right now the GSEs are a very big part of the U.S. mortgage market.
    Senator Bennett. Thank you very much.
"
Chairman Dodd," Senator Casey.
    Senator Casey. Mr. Chairman, thank you very much, and, Chairman Bernanke, I want to thank you for your presence here today and for your testimony.
    We have had the opportunity to question you on a number of occasions, I probably more than most because not only am I Member of this Committee but I am also a Member of the Joint Economic Committee, and we are grateful, again, for your testimony today.
    I wanted to review just some of the basic data, some of which you were kind enough to put in your statement today in terms of where we are economically in this country. It is, to use an old expression from the 1970s, a ``misery index,'' a ``tale of woe,'' but I think it is important to remind all of us kind of where we are.
    You cited on page 3, I guess, of your testimony the average pace of 94,000 jobs per month lost through June. If you look at it another way, just in terms of real GDP, the growth rate over the last couple of years--I had not seen these numbers until recently--2005, 3.1-percent growth, ``only'' I should say; 2006, 2.9; 2007, 2.2; and then the first quarter of 2008, as was cited earlier, 1 percent. The total job loss the last 6 months, 438,000. You look at the trade deficit just with China alone, that went up even though the overall trade deficit went down. Foreclosures, 8,400 to 8,500 families per day, if you look at just weekdays, entering foreclosure. The projection by Treasury for foreclosures for 2008 is at some 2.5 million. The prices report--there is a story today, a brief story in the New York Times, I guess online, sales of retail goods and food grew just 0.1 percent in June. Consumers spent a large amount of money on one product. Of course, gasoline we know, have heard an awful lot about that. But outside of fuel, sales actually dropped last month by 0.5 percent.
    All of that is background, of course, to two basic questions I wanted to ask you, one of which I have asked and you have answered over the course of many months in your appearances here.
    The first question pertains to the difference between the real world of the impact of this economic crisis on families versus the economist's definition of ``recession.'' And I think, frankly, the old definition or the textbook definition of ``recession'' does not apply when it comes to what families are up against.
    And I think it was probably said best, not by a set of the data points I just read and not by any economist, recently in a story in the Centre Daily Times in Pennsylvania, in Centre County, Pennsylvania, ``Tammy May, a single mother of two in Pleasant Gap, Pennsylvania, probably said it best in just one line''--and I am quoting her. She is a single mother of two. ``Pretty much we have reprioritized. The house payment is first, then day care, then we worry about gas, then food.'' Food is number four.
    So I would ask you, in light of that economic misery that I have just highlighted, and in light of your own testimony, your own work, and I think your own sensitivity to these issues, how do we deal with this question of what is a recession and what it isn't, and do we need some new definitions and some new terminology to better define what is happening to real families and real people?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, there is a technical definition of recession which has to do with behavior of employment and investor production and other things, and that is a determination that is made by some economists after the fact. I don't know whether they will determine we have been in a recession or not according to these technical definitions, but I agree with you entirely that whether it is a technical recession or not, the combination of declining wealth, weak job market, rising food and energy prices, foreclosures, tight credit--all those things are putting tremendous pressure on families and explain why consumer sentiment is very low. People are very worried.
    So I certainly would never make the claim that even if we were not in a technical recession that it was not a serious situation. And I just want to assure you that everything the Federal Reserve does is intended to try to promote the welfare of the average American, and that is our objective.
    Senator Casey. Thank you. I think I am out of time. I will go to the next question on the second round.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," I think Senator Bunning, I believe--no, excuse me. Senator Allard. I apologize.
    Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Welcome to the Committee. I always look forward to hearing your comments, Chairman Bernanke. Business lending has--I want to talk about that a little bit, and a big aspect of business lending historically, I am told, has been that business plans and their ability to execute those business plans has been a big factor in assessing credit and whether they get a loan or not. I am told that in recent history that has been minimized considerably.
    First of all, I would like to know if that is true. And the other question, if it is true, do you think we could help confidence if we had provisions that somehow or the other brought more accountability to the business plan aspect when you apply for a loan?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, there is a general tightening in credit and tightening in underwriting standards, you know, related to this pullback from credit risk in general. It has affected different groups differentially. For example, prime corporate borrowers are still able to access the bond market and the loan market pretty effectively. Riskier firms, smaller firms, are having more difficulty accessing credit.
    I think that I would encourage banks to continue to make sound loans, and we at the Federal Reserve will not penalize banks that are making sound loans. We want them to extend credit. In assessing how to make a good loan to a business, certainly there are many factors, including financials and personal relationships and many other things, but the business plan is certainly an important part and one that a good bank lender would look at.
    Senator Allard. You have assumed, meaning the Fed has assumed, a great regulatory oversight authority recently here. Are you comfortable with that? And do you anticipate that you may even take on a greater regulatory role?
"
Mr. Bernanke," We have begun to work with, as you know, the Securities and Exchange Commission, who are the primary regulator. We have been working with them to help evaluate and oversee the four large investment banks and the other primary dealers. That is because of the lending facility that we opened up after Bear Stearns. We have a responsibility to protect our loans, and I believe that the SEC views our participation as helpful in trying to make sure that these firms are sufficiently strong.
    It remains to be seen how the Congress would like to think through regulation going forward. I do think that the investment banks need a consolidated supervisor, but have not proposed a particular agency to do that. The key issue is that they have strong consolidated supervision. The only area in which I have raised the possibility of additional powers for the Federal Reserve--in my testimony and in speeches--is in payment systems, which are systemically important and where in most countries central banks have considerable oversight responsibility.
    I think it would be useful for the Congress to review how payment and settlement systems are overseen and to ask whether, from a systemic point of view, they are adequately regulated and whether the Fed should have some additional role in that area. Otherwise, we are going to have to do a lot of thinking, all of us, and certainly the Congress, about how, if at all, the regulatory structure should change based on what we have learned in the last year.
    Senator Allard. Some of the discussions I have been involved in have said that if the Fed assumes a greater regulatory role, it could affect your independence. And I would like to hear you comment on that as acting in your current role.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, the way Congress wants to organize the regulatory structure is an important question that needs to be worked out, and I am not asking for any change at this moment. However, the Federal Reserve has a wide range of responsibilities, including not only regulatory oversight but also consumer protection, payment systems, and other things. The independence, which is critical, is the independence vis-a-vis monetary policy. And I think we have been able to keep a good separation between monetary policy and these other areas. In these other areas, we are an independent agency, but we have no stronger claimed independence than, say, the OCC would. It is only in monetary policy where we need to maintain a strict independence, you know, in order to make the right decisions.
    Senator Allard. I noticed on some of the projections into 2009 that they seem pretty positive--that they are better than what we are looking at this year, generally. What part of the economic sector do you see will continue to struggle? And where do you see that growth to improve our economy as we move into 2009?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, first of all, there are some factors which have been positive and continue to be positive. Foreign trade exports have been a very positive factor and have contributed significantly to our growth, and as that continues, that will be a basis to build on.
    I mentioned already the home-building sector. That has already declined quite substantially. It is very likely going to begin to level out somewhere around the end of the year. That leveling out will also provide additional strengths, at least in the sense of not subtracting from the GDP growth.
    As the situation begins to stabilize and credit markets begin to stabilize, then I think confidence will return to consumers, and we will see the beginnings of a recovery. But as I noted and as everyone has made allusion to, the uncertainties of the exact timing of this are still great.
    Senator Allard. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you.
    Senator Tester.
    Senator Tester. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you, Chairman Bernanke.
    In your statement, you said the world economy was growing at the fastest pace in decades. I believe that is what you said. Do you anticipate that to continue or to decline?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I think that this year and going into next year, we probably will see some moderation but still healthy growth.
    Senator Tester. So do you think that those impacts, if it backs off some, will have positive or negative or no effect on our financial situation?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, it cuts two ways. On the one hand, it might weaken to some extent the contribution of exports and trade to our growth. But, on the other hand, if these other economies cool down, it might reduce commodity prices or flatten out commodity prices, which would be very beneficial.
    Senator Tester. Do you anticipate overall negative, positive, or pretty static in its effect?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Sorry?
    Senator Tester. I know it is a two-edged sword, but do you anticipate it will be positive, negative, or negligible?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I think it will be probably positive if it contributes to a slowing in commodity prices.
    Senator Tester. You talked about the long-term oil supplies are down. I believe that is what you said.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, not rising.
    Senator Tester. Is that domestically, worldwide, or both?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, certainly oil supplies are declining in the United States. Worldwide, they have been relatively flat.
    Senator Tester. OK. Senator Menendez talked about the dollar and the value it has on oil. Does the budget deficit have any effect on the value of the dollar?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Perhaps a weak effect, but I don't think it is a first-order effect. The linkage between the budget deficit and the trade deficit is there because the trade deficit does reflect our national savings and investment imbalance. But, empirically, the effect is relatively weak under most circumstances.
    Senator Tester. And the value of the dollar has devaluated by about 40 percent--is that correct?--over the last 4 or 5 years.
"
Mr. Bernanke," No. I think it is more like 25 percent. And, again, it has reversed a considerable appreciation prior to that peak in 2002.
    Senator Tester. Are you comfortable with where the dollar's value is now?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I am looking for the economy to strengthen next year, and as it does, I think that will support a strong dollar going forward.
    Senator Tester. Do you anticipate it--OK. That is fine.
    Is there anything that you see on the horizon that could impact the credit rating for the Treasury?
"
Mr. Bernanke," No, I don't. In the very long term, or even the medium term, we need to address these large issues of entitlements and the aging population, and there are tremendous challenges involved there. I don't think anything in the next short period of time, including issues related to the GSEs, for example, would affect the credit rating. That is my understanding, for example, based on statements that some credit raters have made.
    Senator Tester. And we will get into this in the next panel, but what you are saying is that even if we don't do anything with the bill that is being proposed on the GSEs, you don't think that could have any negative impact on the credit rating?
"
Mr. Bernanke," If we don't do anything?
    Senator Tester. If we don't do anything, if we just let it play out.
"
Mr. Bernanke," No, I don't think so. I don't think it would, no.
    Senator Tester. OK. You stated earlier in your testimony that the housing is really kind of the root of what we are seeing, the housing contraction. From my perspective, we have kind of gone into a credit economy. Do you see that as being another part of this equation that is kind of a boat anchor on our economy, that we are making adjustments out of this? Or do you anticipate we are going to be in this, what I would say is a credit economy, from now on?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, a part of what has been happening--and this goes back to Senator Menendez's question about the role of the subprime crisis and so on--is that there was, if you will, a credit boom or a credit bubble where there was an overextension of credit in a lot of areas. There has been a big reversal of attitudes. Banks and other financial institutions are scaling back on their credit risk. They are deleveraging. They are raising capital. And that adjustment process is part of what is happening now that is creating the drag on economic growth. So it is harder to get a mortgage, it is harder to get a business loan. And until we come to a more stable situation where banks are comfortable with their credit standards and their balance sheets, the leveraging process is going to continue and is part of what we are seeing here.
    Senator Tester. And very quickly, because my time is over, do you--I mean, we have heard figures of 150 banks potentially going down because, I assume, of this adjustment that you just talked about. Do you guys have any projections on what kind of impact banking institutions going down, how many there potentially could be in the next year or do you not want to comment on that?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I think I would just refer you to Chairman Bair's list and discussion from the last couple of days. We don't have a projection.
    Senator Tester. How many are on that list?
"
Mr. Bernanke," About 95, as I recall. As I said, I think the banking system came into this episode with good capital basis and with strong earnings.
    Senator Tester. OK. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate that. Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much.
    Senator Bunning.
    Senator Bunning. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Since I did not give an opening statement, I want to give an opening statement in all deference to Chairman Bernanke. I know we have a lot of ground to cover today, but I want to say a few things on the topic of this hearing and the next.
    First, on monetary policy, I am deeply concerned about what the Fed has done in the last year and in the last decade: Chairman Greenspan's easy money in the late 1990s and then followed the tech bust, inflated the housing bubble, and created the mess we are in today. Chairman Bernanke's easy money in the last year has undermined the dollar and sent oil prices to a new high every day, and an almost doubling since the rate cuts started. Inflation is here and hurting us and the average American, and it was brought out very clearly by the Senator from Pennsylvania.
    Second, the Fed is asking for more power, but the Fed has proven they cannot be trusted with the power they have. They get it wrong, do not use it, or stretch it farther than it was ever supposed to go in the first place. As I said a moment ago, their monetary policy is the leading cause of the mess we are in. As regulators, it took until yesterday to use the power we gave them in 1994 to regulate all mortgage lenders. Then they stretched their authority by buying $29 billion worth of Bear Stearns assets so JPMorgan could buy Bear Stearns at a deep discount.
    Now the Fed wants to be a systemic risk regulator, but the Fed is a systemic risk. Giving the Fed more power is like giving a neighborhood kid who broke a window playing baseball in the street a bigger bat and thinking that will fix the problem.
    I am not going to go along with that, and I will use every power in my arsenal as a Senator to stop any new powers going to the Fed. Instead, we should give them less to do so they can get it right, either by taking their monetary responsibility away or by requiring them to focus only on inflation.
    Third, and finally, since I expect we will try to get it right to question the next hearing, let me say a few words about the GSE bailout plan. When I picked up my newspaper yesterday, I thought I woke up in France. But, no, it turned out it was socialism here in the United States of America, and very well, going well. The Treasury Secretary is now asking for a blank check to buy as much Fannie and Freddie debt or equity as he wants. The Fed purchase of Bear Stearns assets was amateur socialism compared to this. And for this unprecedented intervention in our free markets, what assurance do we get that it will not happen again? Absolutely none.
    We are in the process of passing a strong regulator for the GSEs, and that is important. But it allows them to continue in the current form. If they really do fail, we should let them go back to what they were doing before? I doubt it.
    I close with this question, Mr. Chairman. Given what the Fed and Treasury did with Bear Stearns, and given what we are talking about here today, I have to wonder what the next Government intervention into the private enterprise will be. More importantly, where does it all stop?
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," Do you want to respond to that, Mr. Chairman?
    [Laughter.]
"
Chairman Dodd," Senator Bunning just does not have any strong views on these matters. I wish he would be more clear in the future when he speaks.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, I think some of the problems with the GSEs that you allude to were pre-existing. I mean, the moral hazard issue, the Government implicit guarantee, those----
    Senator Bunning. We tried to pass a bill. We could not get it----
"
Mr. Bernanke," And I agreed with----
    Senator Bunning. We passed it here.
"
Mr. Bernanke," And I agree with you.
    Senator Bunning. And it got stuck between here and the floor of the Senate.
"
Mr. Bernanke," And I agree with you on that. As far as powers are concerned, as I mentioned earlier, I think we ought to review the payment system issue which is something that other central banks have. But I have not asked for any other powers.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," Very good.
    Senator Reed.
    Senator Reed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    You indicated in your opening statement that in this economic turmoil the banking system is approaching it with good capital levels. Your estimate is based upon not just their balance sheet, but their off-balance-sheet arrangements. I understand there are new anything rules that will shortly be enacted that will require much more recognition of off-balance-sheet activities. Have you looked at the fully diluted value of the balance sheets? And can you still make that assessment?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I don't think we have done a full assessment. Those rules are yet to be clarified, and I think it may well be some time before they are enacted. At such time we will obviously think hard about how it affects those ratios.
    Senator Reed. But you are beginning to consider much more, I hope, focus on some of these off-balance-sheet----
"
Mr. Bernanke," Oh, certainly. For a long time we have been aware of those off-balance-sheet vehicles. There were some things we did not appreciate. I think one of the issues we did not fully appreciate was what is referred to sometimes as the moral recourse issue, which is that off-balance-sheet vehicles, which are not technically owned by the bank, nevertheless the bank feels for reputational reasons it needs to assume them in a difficult period. We have been thinking about the capital requirements in those kinds of contexts. But we have certainly been quite attentive to off-balance-sheet vehicles, very attentive in particular since this crisis began in August.
    Senator Reed. Let me refer to another issue in your statement. You indicated that one of the contributing factors to the present increase in oil prices is the lack of investment over the last several years. Now with oil at extraordinarily high prices, one would think in a simple market model that investment would be accelerating rapidly.
    Is investment in new drilling and new production and new refining, is that taking place?
"
Mr. Bernanke," In some places, but not to the extent you might think. Part of it is bottlenecks in the materials and manpower and expertise that goes into drilling and development. Part of it is the fact that a large share of the world's oil is controlled by national governments who may not have the same immediate profit motives as a private driller might have. In particular, some countries prohibit foreign technology or foreign investment in their oil production. So there are these political constraints as well that have been affecting the supply as well as economic bottlenecks and other problems.
    Senator Reed. Is there a lack of adequate fields to exploit worldwide? Is that one of the significant factors?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, experts have some disagreement over this, but in terms of proved reserves, there seems to be adequate oil in the ground. It is really a question of exploiting it.
    Senator Reed. You indicated that in terms of speculation, that was not a significant factor, but you are, with the CFTC, looking into the issue of possible speculation. And I am getting into dangerous ground. You are an economist and I am not. But it would seem to me this is a market that would be ripe for speculation. Demand is highly inelastic. Price signals are blunted in many countries because of subsidies. Is that your understanding of the market, that there is an opportunity at least for speculation in this particular market for oil?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, there is speculation, but speculation under most circumstances is a positive thing. It provides liquidity and allows people to hedge their risks. It provides price discovery. It can help allocate oil availability over time, depending on the pattern of futures prices and so on.
    What is really a concern--what the CFTC, for example, is concerned with would be manipulation as opposed to speculation.
    Senator Reed. Well, I will use the term ``manipulation'' in the same situation.
"
Mr. Bernanke," And as I said, you know, transparency and data collection are important aspects of assuring there is no manipulation. But given the enormous size of this market, it is quite a difficult market--would be quite a difficult market, I would think, to corner.
    Senator Reed. Thank you. My time is about to expire.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much, Senator.
    Senator Dole.
    Senator Dole. Chairman Bernanke, in December of last year----
"
Chairman Dodd," Senator, would you just postpone for 1 second? What I am going to do here with Members, by the way, is several Members who have already asked questions have gone to vote, and they will come right back. And this way we will try and keep going. If there is going to be a minute or two before you get to question, I suggest you go vote and come back. We are not going to interrupt. I want to give everyone a chance to get one round in on this before we move to our larger panel.
    Senator Dole, please.
    Senator Dole. In December of last year, Attorney General Cuomo of New York entered into an agreement with Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and OFHEO to create a mortgage appraiser code of conduct. While everyone appreciates the goals of this agreement, the code leans heavily toward inconsistent and potentially counterproductive regulation of the lending industry and, if implemented poorly, could actually increase costs of obtaining appraisals and slow down the process of obtaining appraisals.
    Recognizing that the current settlement recommendations are inconsistent with current appraisal regulations and guidelines issued by the FFIEC Subcommittee on Appraisals, what are you doing to ensure that implementation of the code of conduct does not further disrupt the current housing and mortgage crises on federally regulated banking institutions? What can you do?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Senator, as I understand, the agreement requires acceptance by the FFIEC, by the bank regulators, and so we are currently looking at it, and we do want to make sure that it does not prevent banks, for example, from using their own appraisers in situations where they need that information to make a good appraisal. And we want to make sure it does not impose excessive costs--there are already guidances by the regulators about how to do appraisals which already exist for banks. And we think those are pretty good, and we want to make sure there is no inconsistency. So we are looking at that, but we want to be particularly careful about some of the issues that you have just raised.
    Senator Dole. As you are aware, the FDIC gathers and monitors various bank performance data for its member institutions as part of its regulatory oversight, and this is on a quarterly basis, of course. Ending with this most recent data collection period, the end of the first quarter of 2008, the FDIC's data indicates that banks in North Carolina are on fairly good footing relative to its peer group nationally. But the report did show the number of unprofitable financial institutions with a market cap under $1 billion in my home State increased from the previous quarter, while the national numbers actually improved.
    My question for you is whether the Fed currently reviews the performance of smaller financial institutions such as community banks as a proxy for the health of the local economy in which they served. And if so, how does this information factor into Fed policy?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Senator, we absolutely do look at community banks. We have a regulatory responsibility for State member banks, which include many, many small banks that we oversee in conjunction with the State regulator or with the FDIC. There are many benefits of our regulation of those banks in terms of what we learn, but, in particular, as you point out, small banks have their fingers on the pulse of the local economy, and they can provide us a lot of useful information about what is happening. And for the same reason, we are required to have bankers on the boards of the reserve banks around the country so that we can gather information from them and benefit from their insights.
    Senator Dole. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you, Senator Dole.
    Senator Brown.
    Senator Brown. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, thank you. Nice to see you again, and thank you for your public service.
    I appreciate the Fed has finalized its regulation for some prime mortgage lending. In my view, as you know, this comes, especially in a place like Ohio, several years too late. Hindsight, of course, is near perfect, but there were lots of voices and warning signals trying to get the Fed to act both here in Washington, also at places like the Cleveland Fed and elsewhere.
    First of all, I appreciate the refreshingly different approach you have to this job and to this issue than that of your predecessor. I think that is very good for our country. But there is a certain cynicism in the public at large how, when Bear Stearns gets in trouble, when Fannie and Freddie get in trouble, that you act, that Congress acts, the Treasury Department acts, but we do not act so quickly, neither the regulatory system, the Fed, the Congress act so quickly in protecting the public and the issues that Senator Casey, the story Senator Casey brought up.
    Tell me what steps we need to take, and you need to take especially, to get the same rapid response for consumers, for consumer protection, that we have achieved, if you will, with Bear Stearns and with Fannie and Freddie.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, Senator, first, although I know it is not always easy to explain, our actions, as I said earlier, with respect to Bear Stearns, with respect to Fannie and Freddie, with respect to the financial system in general are based on our view that financial stability is critical to economic stability. I think the benefit is more obvious to the average person from Fannie and Freddie because they, after all, are providing liquidity for mortgages, and people want to be able to have access to mortgages. So I just do not accept the distinction between helping Wall Street and helping Main Street. The actions we have taken are aimed at supporting the overall economy and helping the average American.
    With respect to your question, I agree that there was a delay in recognition of this issue. Once we undertook it, though, we had to go through a regulatory process that involves developing regulations, putting them out for comment, re-evaluating them and so on. There is a natural period of time. I think that is probably a good thing in the sense that we want regulations to be well thought out and so on. But to the extent that Congress wants to act more quickly or is concerned about the constraints on the agency's powers given to them by their enabling legislation, Congress, of course, can act very quickly if they need to.
    Senator Brown. While I do not oppose your actions on what we are going to try to do with Fannie and Freddie, and I think we did what we had to do with Bear Stearns, I think there is a perception, and probably a reasonable perception, a deserved perception, that our Government, whether it is regulatory process or the Congress, is much more apt to move quickly on Wall Street when we do not move so quickly on Main Street. Granted, you had to go through a process, and as I say, I think you are refreshingly different from your predecessor. But what can you do to speed that up so the public really can be assured that while it does make sense for the economy as a whole, which helps everyone on Main Street, too, doing the right thing with Wall Street, but it is pretty clear that when--and the Bush administration really did not seem to think there was a subprime crisis until it spread to Wall Street. When it was just Main Street, Mansfield, and Main Street, Zanesville, it did not seem to be much of a problem.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, we just have to do a better job, first of all, monitoring what is going on. The Treasury Secretary had an interesting idea. The mortgage origination commission, I think it was called, would be evaluating the quality of the State regulators to make sure that State-regulated institutions were being adequately supervised. So that is one possible suggestion. But in a way of keeping better tabs on what is going on, we need to be more vigilant, and we need to be as effective and rapid as possible in promulgating good regulations. But, again, the legal process and our responsibility to do a good job means that we cannot produce the regulations in a month. It really does take some time for us to do all the work, including one thing we have done at the Fed, which is a lot of consumer testing, to make sure that people understand disclosures, for example. We think we get more effective regulation that way.
    Senator Brown. Does the Fed have a mechanism to listen better to the regional--when the Cleveland Fed feeds you information about a problem that may come to Cleveland before it comes to New York or before it comes to Chicago or Los Angeles, do you feel like the Fed here is listening to places like Cleveland the way that you should?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Absolutely. The 12 reserve banks around the country were created to make sure that the Fed always had a national constituency, that it always listened to the concerns of the whole country and not just the financial sector, and that works very effectively. We do have a lot of input from reserve banks and their boards, their advisory councils, their contacts. And related to my reply to Senator Dole, those kinds of contacts are useful in a macroeconomic monetary sense, but also in a regulatory sense as well.
    Senator Carper [presiding]. The Senator's time has expired. When Senator Martinez returns, it will be his time to ask questions, but until he does, I am going to ask a few of my own. Welcome, Mr. Chairman.
    I was reflecting. How long have you been Federal Reserve Chairman now?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Two-and-a-half years.
    Senator Carper. Does it seem that long?
    [Laughter.]
"
Mr. Bernanke," About that long.
    Senator Carper. Did you ever imagine in your wildest dreams that the Federal Reserve would end up being called upon to do the kinds of things you have done in recent months? I remember when you were going through your confirmation hearing, we focused, as I recall, on just what should be the right rate of inflation, kind of, if you will, the window or the limits for the rate of inflation. I do not think we ever asked you whether or not the discount window should be made available to investment banks. I do not think we ever asked you if the discount window should be made available to Fannie or to Freddie. I do not think we ever asked you about trying to arrange the marriage, if you will, of JPMorgan Chase with Bear Stearns.
    All that stuff has just come along, and I want to commend you and those with whom you serve, those who you lead, for the way you have responded, and quickly, thinking outside the Box, and trying to help us through all of this. I thought you said a great truth in terms of where we want to position ourselves as we come out of this fall. We have seen this drop in housing values, and I think part of what is going on here in our economy today is the loss of confidence you have alluded to. We have seen a loss of home equity, and a lot of us in this country have treated the equity in our home as a piggy bank, and the wealth effect that we derive from that, and couple that with going up to the gas pump and spending $80 or $90 to fill up the tank of our vehicles--I think the two of those together has a dramatic negative effect on our confidence in this country and has sort of led to it.
    One of the questions you were asked earlier--and I want to follow up on it--was: Where do we want to be when we bottom out? Eventually, we will bottom out. There are a lot of people who are renting today that are not buying, but eventually they are going to want to get in. They are going to want to be homeowners. What are the things that we need to be doing to make sure that when they are ready to move, when they think that we have come to the bottom and prices are starting to go back up? Just say again, how do we want to plow the field, how do we want to prepare the field in terms of a mortgage market and in terms of housing markets? And you have said some of this already. I just want you to re-emphasize it, please?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, of course, fundamentally the market will do it. The free market will do it. But there are things that we can do. The Federal Reserve has already tried to address, some of the regulatory aspects of high-cost mortgage lending. We and our fellow regulators are also looking at the treatment of mortgages by banks and other lenders in terms of their capital and how they manage that. I think the banks and the private sector themselves are rethinking the standards, the underwriting standards, the loan-to-value ratios, those sorts of things as they go forward.
    So, I anticipate that we will have a healthy recovery in the housing market once we have gone through this necessary process. But it will probably be less exuberant than we saw earlier with somewhat tougher underwriting standards, more investment due diligence, probably less use of securitization or complex securitized products. But I am confident that, with the appropriate background--I probably include here the GSEs and FHA--the housing market will recover, and it will help be part of the economy's return to growth.
    Senator Carper. One of my colleagues asked you earlier about the drop in the value of the dollar and asked you quantify that. I will not ask you to do that again. But we have seen the dollar drop, whether it is 20 percent or 30 percent or some other number. We have seen exports, conversely, rise, but yet we have seen a continued loss in manufacturing jobs in this country. I think the last month I noticed maybe 30,000 or 40,000 additional manufacturing jobs had been lost.
    When do we see that turn around? And what do we need to do to turn it around, the loss of manufacturing jobs, that is?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, there has been an ongoing loss of manufacturing jobs even during periods of growth in production because the U.S. manufacturing sector is enormously productive and its productivity has been growing more quickly than the rest of the economy. And so even when output is growing--and we have some of the best growth and the highest productivity growth in manufacturing of any industrialized country--because of the high productivity growth, you need fewer workers to make the same amount of output.
    Now, one thing that has certainly been clear, and we have seen in the U.S. manufacturing over the last few years, is an increasing emphasis on sophisticated high-tech exports, including capital goods and so on. And what I hear from manufacturers is that they have plenty of low-skilled workers, but what they need are workers with high skills--not necessarily a college degree, but with skills, like welding and machine work and so on. And, in fact, the number of skilled manufacturing workers has actually been rising, not falling.
    So I think the future for us is to continue to go to more and more sophisticated manufacturing products, but to support that and to make sure there are good jobs associated with it, we need to have the training and education that will provide the workforce that is consistent with that.
    Senator Carper. The last question that I have deals with just to follow up on the drop in the value of the dollar. The hearings that we have had in this Committee and other committees that I have participated in suggest there are three major factors driving up the cost of oil. One of those is the laws of supply and demand. Nations are pretty much holding their output level. Demand is rising. There has been--we discussed the drop in the value of the dollar and the effect that that has had. The third factor that we keep coming back to is the role that speculation is playing. We touched on this at least indirectly here today. Just give us some advice. I think we are going to debate, seriously debate, probably before the beginning of next month, legislation dealing with speculation to try to curb the excesses that may be occurring there. If you could give us some advice, it would be timely and much appreciated.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, as I said, based on the evidence that is available, I would not estimate that speculation or particularly manipulation is a significant part of the rise in oil prices.
    That said, the CFTC and others are looking at the data and trying to evaluate that. These are very difficult matters. We do not want to do anything that will stop the futures markets from legitimate functions like providing liquidity and hedging. So, my advice would be to go slow and carefully and to take the insights that you get from the CFTC and others who are associated directly overseeing these activities.
    Despite the concerns--and I fully understand the concerns about high gas prices--I don't think it is likely that you can have a big effect on gas prices with short-term moves in the futures markets. And I would urge careful and deliberate action in this area.
    Senator Carper. All right. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Senator Martinez is next, and then followed by Senator Akaka.
    Senator Martinez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
    Mr. Chairman, thank you very much for being with us today. I wanted to focus on a couple of areas. One was your remarks during your testimony regarding the fundamental issue in the energy situation which you identify one of supply and demand, which makes sense to me. I wonder if you might dwell just for a moment on the speculation side as to why you do not see that as a fundamental part of the problem, but then also what we could do to be more helpful in the area of transparency and oversight.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, there are a number of pieces of evidence against the view that speculation is a primary force. I mentioned in my testimony the absence of hoarding or inventories that you would expect to see if speculation was driving prices above the supply demand equilibrium. There are a number of studies which show that there is little or no connection between the open interest taken by non-commercial traders in futures markets and the subsequent movements in prices.
    It is also interesting to note that there are many commodities--or at least some commodities--that are not even traded on futures markets, like iron ore, for example, which have had very large increases in prices. So I think the evidence is fairly weak.
    That said, I think that transparency in futures markets, information available to the overseer, the CFTC, is a positive thing. And I expect that the CFTC will come forward with some suggestions in that regard. But I just do not think it is going to be a magic bullet to address this very difficult problem of high oil and commodity prices.
    Senator Martinez. In other words, well, it might be helpful and useful to have more transparency ultimately. The supply and demand equilibrium is only going to be impacted by more supply or less demand.
"
Mr. Bernanke," I believe that to be true, yes.
    Senator Martinez. I want to commend you for the work you have done in consumer protection. I noted in your testimony in a couple of areas that I think are particularly important. I think that it is terrific to prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for a consumer's ability to make the scheduled payments. And I also think it is great to also include the escrowing of property taxes and insurance as an integral part of what we need to do in order to keep homeowners in their home.
    And, last, the area of credit cards as well, I think all those are very, very good things for consumers, and particularly at stressful times like this, it is good to have a reckoning of where we are and where we are going and include that in that help to consumers.
    I know in the next panel we will talk more about the GSE situation. I want to talk about regulatory reform, if I could. Your predecessor and I had an opportunity to discuss this when I was Secretary of HUD, and I recall also coming before this Committee and testifying with Secretary Snow at that time, proposing a new regulatory framework for the GSEs. That was in 2003. I wish we might have done that. But at the same time, we are where we are today.
    We do have a piece of legislation moving its way through the Congress, which includes the creation of a new affordable housing trust fund. This affordable housing trust fund is funded by a fee on the GSEs' new business purchases. So, in other words, as they increase their book of business, this fund would grow at a percentage of that.
    I wondered if you have a concern, which I certainly have, about this provision. particularly at a time when the GSEs are suffering such substantial losses and when we are, in fact, taking other Government action in order to ensure their sustainability.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Senator, I think that is really a congressional prerogative. I really have not gotten into that particular issue. I think the really critical issue, as you alluded to, is that we have a strong and robust regulator that will restore confidence in the markets and will allow Fannie and Freddie to support the mortgage market in the way they are intended to do. That would be my emphasis.
    Senator Martinez. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you, Senator.
    Senator Akaka.
    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Let me add my welcome to Chairman Bernanke for being here, and my concerns in our country is to educate the people of America as well as to protect them and empower them in our financial system.
    Given the recent failures, I am concerned by the increasing lack of trust that individuals have in the banking system. When large numbers of depositors lose trust in their financial institution and demand their money back, the bank can fail as a result, and we know that.
    In addition, distrust of the banking system causes many immigrants to miss out on savings, borrowing, and low-cost remittance opportunities found at banks and credit unions.
    My question to you is: What must be done to increase trust in the banking system among depositors as well as among the unbanked?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, Senator, you point to a legitimate question, which is that there are still many people, disproportionately immigrants, who do not have a checking account, do not have a savings account, and these are the ``unbanked,'' as the term goes. In not all but in many cases, those people would be better off with a banking relationship. They might be able to avoid high fees for remittances, for example, or high fees for check cashing if they were associated with a bank. To some extent, it is a cultural element. We encourage banks to reach out to communities, to have people who speak the appropriate language.
    On the other side, as you know--and this is one of your important issues that you have been a leader on--is to promote financial literacy and to get folks to understand, how to manage their finances and how important having the right relationships with financial institutions can be.
    So I think it is really on both sides. We have to get the banks to reach out. We have to get the public to understand and reach out. Where necessary, as in the case of home mortgages, disclosures and regulation may be necessary to keep the contracts, clear enough that the public can make use of them. And in that respect, I hope that, for example, our actions on mortgage lending will restore some confidence where there are people who feel that they got burned taking out a subprime mortgage. Perhaps in the future, they will see more clearly what the contract entails, and they will be more confident in taking out a mortgage.
    So it is a very important issue, and we can address it, I think, from a number of different directions.
    Senator Akaka. Thank you. Working families, as you know, are having trouble paying for increases today in gasoline, groceries, and other daily living expenses while wages are not increasing fast enough and affordable credit is becoming harder to obtain. I am deeply concerned that too many working families are being exploited by the unscrupulous lenders who give payday loans, and this is where protection, I think, is needed.
    I have been impressed by the work of the National Credit Union Administration, NCUA, due to a NCUA grant on the windward side of the island of Oahu in Hawaii at the Community Federal Credit Union at Kailua, and it has developed an affordable alternative to payday loans to help U.S. Marines and other members they serve. We must further encourage the development of these alternatives so that working families have access to affordable small loans.
    My question to you is: What must be done to protect consumers from high-cost payday loans and encourage the development of affordable payday loan alternatives?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, again, I think that competition is the best solution, and I give particular credit to credit unions. They have done some especially good work in terms of providing remittance services to allow people to get money back to their families without exorbitant cost. But I think we should continue to urge banks and other financial institutions to reach out into underserved neighborhoods. That is, in fact, part of the Community Reinvestment Act to try to do that to give people the alternative rather than the storefront in their neighborhood.
    So I think that is a desirable goal, and through financial literacy education and working with banks and community development experts, I think we can make progress in that direction, and I would very much like to support that.
    Senator Akaka. Thank you very much for your responses.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much.
    Senator Crapo, you are next, then Senator Bayh, and then I believe we are prepared to move to the additional panel members here. So Senator Crapo.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.
    I want to return for just a moment--I know you have gone over this a lot already--to the question of speculation and the issue of prohibiting or aggressively regulating the over-the-counter derivatives. And, you know, I understand that measures to enhance the transparency in our energy markets are a very appropriate response to today's global markets. I am concerned, however, that overly restrictive limitations on the number of speculative positions that can be held by individuals or other entities could have significant impacts on liquidity in those markets and naturally have the opposite impact that we would intend by those actions, namely, to reduce liquidity and actually drive the price of fuel up or petroleum up.
    Could you comment on that?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Certainly. First of all, OTC derivatives are not really unregulated in that the dealers and the banks who make these transactions are, of course, regulated in one way or another, and one of the things that the oversight regulators do is make sure that they are taking adequate precautions of a counterparty risk, that they are managing their positions in a safe way.
    In general, I think there is some reason to look for more standardization where possible so that we could begin to use particular exchanges as ways of improving liquidity and management of counterparty risk. But I think there is always going to be some scope for over-the-counter products because they are the ones that customize to the particular needs of the other party.
    So I think it is important for us to maintain our oversight of the dealers and the banks. We need to continue to work to make sure that the clearing and settlement process works efficiently so there is no confusion or delay. There is some scope for working toward standardization in order to move toward essential counterparties or exchanges. But I think we are always going to have over-the-counter derivatives. They serve a useful function. They help with risk sharing. They provide liquidity to hedgers. And so, I am not advocating any major change in the way we look at those particular instruments other than making sure we clear them and settle them properly.
    Senator Crapo. If you take, say, futures trading in petroleum as an example, isn't it correct that for every transaction, there is a counterparty? In other words, every time there is a buyer, there is also a seller.
"
Mr. Bernanke," Yes, of course. With almost no exceptions, speculators in commodities never take delivery. They have to sell their position when it comes due, and so they are not in any way using up the physical resource that underlies the contract. So there has always to be two sides to every transaction.
    Senator Crapo. And the liquidity that we are talking about, am I correct, is primarily being provided for those who are not actual users of petroleum. This liquidity is primarily coming from pension funds. Is that not correct?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, it depends which side of the transaction you are on. You have people on both sides who are trying to make a bet essentially on whether oil prices will go up or down. But, clearly, one of the major economic functions of futures markets is to allow those who want to lay off their risk, like an airline, the opportunity to sell or to buy forward the fuel so that they will not be subject to the risk of price fluctuations. And it is the activities of speculators in those markets that provides the other side of that transaction and makes those markets liquid and allows them to serve that function.
    Senator Crapo. The airlines are a good example. As you know, a number of the CEOs of a number of airlines have maintained that the price of their jet fuel is being forced unnaturally high because of market speculation in the futures market. Do you believe that they are correct in that?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, as I have indicated, I think that it is worthwhile making sure that, there is some transparency, that we are doing all we can to make sure these markets are as liquid and as efficient as possible. CFTC has the primary responsibility for that. We are happy to work with them and try to support that.
    So I am not saying there cannot be improvements made in these markets, but my best guess, as I have indicated a few times now, is that I do not think that speculative activity per se, or particularly manipulation, is the principal cause of the increases in energy and other commodity prices that we have been seeing.
    Senator Crapo. Thank you.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you, Senator, very much.
    Senator Bayh.
    Senator Bayh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and given the nature of our having to leave to vote and then come back, I hope that my questions are not redundant. It is an occupational hazard.
    You mentioned that the housing turmoil is sort of the crux of many of the challenges that we are currently facing. Have there been any analogous episodes in other countries previously or in our own that might give some guidance as to--or further guidance as to when this might bottom out?
"
Mr. Bernanke," There have been similar episodes in the U.K. and Australia, for example. But it is hard to draw strict analogies. One reason is that the financing systems are different in the different countries. Clearly, in this case, the high loan-to-value subprime adjustable rate mortgages, those sorts of instruments were particularly sensitive to the decline in house prices that we saw, and the effects, therefore, on credit quality and on bank balance sheets were stronger. So there are other examples, and we have looked at those. Most of them suggest, which is something which I am sure we are all happy to hear, that eventually the new equilibriums is established, the housing market comes back into balance, and the negative effects of that are ended, and you begin to see more stable growth again. I am sure that will happen here, but there is not an exact analogy.
    Senator Bayh. Well, along those lines--and I know you are reluctant to offer advice to the legislative branch of Government, but I am sure you have followed the bill that passed out of the Senate last week. Going over to the House, there may be some marginal adjustments, but probably not more than that. Is there anything else we should be looking at doing here in a timely fashion to address the housing challenge that has not been included in this legislation?
"
Mr. Bernanke," No, I do not think so. Not that I can think of. Again, as this next hearing will reveal, of course, you now have a set of issues and questions to answer relating to the GSEs, and, of course, that fits directly with the elements of the bill that already include a stronger regulator. So I think that is going to be a very, very important issue in the next weeks and months for the----
    Senator Bayh. And that is going to raise the topic of borrowing from the discount window, which I would like to ask you about. What currently is the amount that has been let from the window as we gather here today?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, the loans are short-term loans, and they are rolled over. So I could not give you----
    Senator Bayh. We do not know the----
"
Mr. Bernanke," Several hundred billion dollars outstanding at any given time. But I----
    Senator Bayh. Several hundred billion at a time?
"
Mr. Bernanke," At a given time, yes.
    Senator Bayh. Is there any limit to the amount that can be utilized through that mechanism, any practical limit? We have the investment banks partaking. If we get the GSEs partaking, I am just wondering how much more there is to be had from that mechanism.
"
Mr. Bernanke," I think the Federal Reserve's balance sheet is about $900 billion, and even if we reached that level, which I have no expectation we would, there are other things we could do to address that.
    Senator Bayh. I read here recently--I think it was the Economist. I cannot recall the source of the data, but it caught my eye, and I would like your reaction to it. The assertion was by some analysts that of the stimulus checks that had been sent, 90 percent of the amount had been saved. Do you have a reaction to that?
"
Mr. Bernanke," I do not know how they would know that. The historical experience, based, for example, on the checks that were sent in 2001, suggests that people spent something on the order of 40 to 50 percent of their check within a few quarters. The relatively strong consumer spending number, as we saw recently, could be due to even a higher propensity to spend out of those checks. So to my way of thinking, so far it seems that they are having an effect, but we will not really know for sure until we see how things play out over the next two quarters.
    Senator Bayh. Just two final questions, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Dodd asked you about the prospects of a second stimulus package moving through. My question is: If we are really looking at trying to buttress the consumer at this fragile time, doesn't income and wealth level, don't those affect the marginal propensity to consume? Is that an accurate statement?
"
Mr. Bernanke," That is generally thought to be the case.
    Senator Bayh. And should that not lead us to focus on those who are more likely to consumer, you know, the more middle-class, lower-middle-class level, if propping up the consumer is our aim?
"
Mr. Bernanke," As I said when we were discussing the first stimulus package, one of the criteria was to be targeted, which means to go to people who would be more likely to spend in the short term, and, generally speaking though it is not uniform, there tends to be a higher spending propensity from people of lower income and lower wealth
    Senator Bayh. My final question here as my time expires: There has been a recent increase in the price of credit default swaps on U.S. Treasurys. What do you think accounts for that? And should that be a matter of some concern in the message the market seems to be sending about their confidence?
"
Mr. Bernanke," There has been a lot of movement in a variety of spreads, for example, the spreads between newly issued and previously issued bonds and so on. I would not read too much into that. It is a very small change. I think it has more to do with liquidity in markets and other risk aversion--other types of behavior rather than any sense that there is a default risk. That would be my guess.
    Senator Bayh. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much, Senator.
    We have one additional question from Senator Schumer.
    Senator Schumer. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you for being here. I had two.
    One is not about the Fannie and Freddie rescue per se, but just about the criteria. There is tremendous focus on the stock price, which we all know has sunk a great deal. But it seems to me that of much greater importance to the economy and to the markets and even to the stability of Fannie and Freddie is the differential that Fannie and Freddie have to pay for their bonds and, say, the U.S. Government has to pay for Treasury's. Do you agree with that, and could you give us some indication of how the bond spread is going? And how does it measures in terms of Fannie and Freddie's stability?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, that bond spread opened up last week. It has generally come in since Paulson announced these actions. I think that is very important, both because Fannie and Freddie obligations, both MBS and corporate debt, are held all over the world, including large amounts by banks, so that is very important. And, second, that determines their marginal cost of finance for mortgages, which ultimately we want to make sure that mortgages are available at a reasonable price.
    So the announcements have been generally good for the debt because of the sense that the Government is going to become involved in these agencies. The stock prices are also important because they affect the ability of Fannie and Freddie to raise capital. And I think at this point, there is probably a lot of uncertainty for shareholders as to exactly what is going to happen and to what extent that will affect the value of their shares.
    Senator Schumer. One final question. There has been a lot of talk now about somehow limiting short selling, particularly in financial companies, because of all the problems. Now, a while ago we had something called the uptick rule, which provided some measure of restraint on short sellers. When we changed from selling stocks from eighths to hundredths, an uptick of one one-hundredth does not mean much. But I have heard some ideas recently--I have been toying with it--of recommending that we go back to the uptick rule and say you don't need a one one-hundredth uptick, but you need 12 upticks, and you get back to the one-eighth.
    Do you have any thoughts, preliminary thoughts, on whether that would be a good idea and, in general, your view on short selling as it affects the markets here?
"
Mr. Bernanke," Well, I think you do not want to rule out short selling as a general matter. That is a way for markets to be efficient and for people to take a view on where a stock price ought to be. There are already limits on so-called naked shorts without owning the stock, and certainly we want to be very careful about situations in which a potential short seller spreads unverified rumors and so on.
    I think I am in an excellent position here to answer your question because Chairman Cox is going to be sitting next to me in a few minutes, and I think he could give you a much better sense of where they are at the SEC on this issue. But my short answer is that some limits on short selling are probably appropriate, but we want to make sure that legitimate short selling remains part of the market.
    Senator Schumer. I agree with both.
    Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
"
Chairman Dodd," Thank you very much, Senator, and with that, we are going to take a couple minutes' break, give the Chairman an opportunity to take a few minutes, and we will invite Secretary Paulson and Chairman Cox to come into the room, and we will begin the second phase of this hearing. So we will take about 5 minutes here.
    [Whereupon, at 12:09 p.m., the hearing was adjourned.]

                 PREPARED STATEMENT OF BEN S. BERNANKE
                               Chairman,
            Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
                             July 15, 2008
    Chairman Dodd, Senator Shelby, and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress.
    The U.S. economy and financial system have confronted some significant challenges thus far in 2008. The contraction in housing activity that began in 2006 and the associated deterioration in mortgage markets that became evident last year have led to sizable losses at financial institutions and a sharp tightening in overall credit conditions. The effects of the housing contraction and of the financial headwinds on spending and economic activity have been compounded by rapid increases in the prices of energy and other commodities, which have sapped household purchasing power even as they have boosted inflation. Against this backdrop, economic activity has advanced at a sluggish pace during the first half of this year, while inflation has remained elevated.
    Following a significant reduction in its policy rate over the second half of 2007, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) eased policy considerably further through the spring to counter actual and expected weakness in economic growth and to mitigate downside risks to economic activity. In addition, the Federal Reserve expanded some of the special liquidity programs that were established last year and implemented additional facilities to support the functioning of financial markets and foster financial stability. Although these policy actions have had positive effects, the economy continues to face numerous difficulties, including ongoing strains in financial markets, declining house prices, a softening labor market, and rising prices of oil, food, and some other commodities. Let me now turn to a more detailed discussion of some of these key issues.
    Developments in financial markets and their implications for the macroeconomic outlook have been a focus of monetary policymakers over the past year. In the second half of 2007, the deteriorating performance of subprime mortgages in the United States triggered turbulence in domestic and international financial markets as investors became markedly less willing to bear credit risks of any type. In the first quarter of 2008, reports of further losses and write-downs at financial institutions intensified investor concerns and resulted in further sharp reductions in market liquidity. By March, many dealers and other institutions, even those that had relied heavily on short-term secured financing, were facing much more stringent borrowing conditions.
    In mid-March, a major investment bank, The Bear Stearns Companies, Inc., was pushed to the brink of failure after suddenly losing access to short-term financing markets. The Federal Reserve judged that a disorderly failure of Bear Stearns would pose a serious threat to overall financial stability and would most likely have significant adverse implications for the U.S. economy. After discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and in consultation with the Treasury, we invoked emergency authorities to provide special financing to facilitate the acquisition of Bear Stearns by JPMorgan Chase & Co. In addition, the Federal Reserve used emergency authorities to establish two new facilities to provide backstop liquidity to primary dealers, with the goals of stabilizing financial conditions and increasing the availability of credit to the broader economy. \1\ We have also taken additional steps to address liquidity pressures in the banking system, including a further easing of the terms for bank borrowing at the discount window and increases in the amount of credit made available to banks through the Term Auction Facility. The FOMC also authorized expansions of its currency swap arrangements with the European Central Bank and the Swiss National Bank to facilitate increased dollar lending by those institutions to banks in their jurisdictions.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \1\ Primary dealers are financial institutions that trade in U.S. government securities with the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. On behalf of the Federal Reserve System, the New York Fed's Open Market Desk engages in the trades to implement monetary policy.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    These steps to address liquidity pressures coupled with monetary easing seem to have been helpful in mitigating some market strains. During the second quarter, credit spreads generally narrowed, liquidity pressures ebbed, and a number of financial institutions raised new capital. However, as events in recent weeks have demonstrated, many financial markets and institutions remain under considerable stress, in part because the outlook for the economy, and thus for credit quality, remains uncertain. In recent days, investors became particularly concerned about the financial condition of the government-sponsored enterprises (GSEs), Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. In view of this development, and given the importance of these firms to the mortgage market, the Treasury announced a legislative proposal to bolster their capital, access to liquidity, and regulatory oversight. As a supplement to the Treasury's existing authority to lend to the GSEs and as a bridge to the time when the Congress decides how to proceed on these matters, the Board of Governors authorized the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to lend to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, should that become necessary. Any lending would be collateralized by U.S. government and Federal agency securities. In general, healthy economic growth depends on well-functioning financial markets. Consequently, helping the financial markets to return to more normal functioning will continue to be a top priority of the Federal Reserve.
    I turn now to current economic developments and prospects. The economy has continued to expand, but at a subdued pace. In the labor market, private payroll employment has declined this year, falling at an average pace of 94,000 jobs per month through June. Employment in the construction and manufacturing sectors has been particularly hard hit, although employment declines in a number of other sectors are evident as well. The unemployment rate has risen and now stands at 5\1/2\ percent.
    In the housing sector, activity continues to weaken. Although sales of existing homes have been about unchanged this year, sales of new homes have continued to fall, and inventories of unsold new homes remain high. In response, homebuilders continue to scale back the pace of housing starts. Home prices are falling, particularly in regions that experienced the largest price increases earlier this decade. The declines in home prices have contributed to the rising tide of foreclosures; by adding to the stock of vacant homes for sale, these foreclosures have, in turn, intensified the downward pressure on home prices in some areas.
    Personal consumption expenditures have advanced at a modest pace so far this year, generally holding up somewhat better than might have been expected given the array of forces weighing on household finances and attitudes. In particular, with the labor market softening and consumer price inflation elevated, real earnings have been stagnant so far this year; declining values of equities and houses have taken their toll on household balance sheets; credit conditions have tightened; and indicators of consumer sentiment have fallen sharply. More positively, the fiscal stimulus package is providing some timely support to household incomes. Overall, consumption spending seems likely to be restrained over coming quarters.
    In the business sector, real outlays for equipment and software were about flat in the first quarter of the year, and construction of nonresidential structures slowed appreciably. In the second quarter, the available data suggest that business fixed investment appears to have expanded moderately. Nevertheless, surveys of capital spending plans indicate that firms remain concerned about the economic and financial environment, including sharply rising costs of inputs and indications of tightening credit, and they are likely to be cautious with spending in the second half of the year. However, strong export growth continues to be a significant boon to many U.S. companies.
    In conjunction with the June FOMC meeting, Board members and Reserve Bank presidents prepared economic projections covering the years 2008 through 2010. On balance, most FOMC participants expected that, over the remainder of this year, output would expand at a pace appreciably below its trend rate, primarily because of continued weakness in housing markets, elevated energy prices, and tight credit conditions. Growth is projected to pick up gradually over the next 2 years as residential construction bottoms out and begins a slow recovery and as credit conditions gradually improve. However, FOMC participants indicated that considerable uncertainty surrounded their outlook for economic growth and viewed the risks to their forecasts as skewed to the downside.
    Inflation has remained high, running at nearly a 3\1/2\ percent annual rate over the first 5 months of this year as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures. And, with gasoline and other consumer energy prices rising in recent weeks, inflation seems likely to move temporarily higher in the near term.
    The elevated level of overall consumer inflation largely reflects a continued sharp run-up in the prices of many commodities, especially oil but also certain crops and metals. \2\ The spot price of West Texas intermediate crude oil soared about 60 percent in 2007 and, thus far this year, has climbed an additional 50 percent or so. The price of oil currently stands at about five times its level toward the beginning of this decade. Our best judgment is that this surge in prices has been driven predominantly by strong growth in underlying demand and tight supply conditions in global oil markets. Over the past several years, the world economy has expanded at its fastest pace in decades, leading to substantial increases in the demand for oil. Moreover, growth has been concentrated in developing and emerging market economies, where energy consumption has been further stimulated by rapid industrialization and by government subsidies that hold down the price of energy faced by ultimate users.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
     \2\ The dominant role of commodity prices in driving the recent increase in inflation can be seen by contrasting the overall inflation rate with the so-called core measure of inflation, which excludes food and energy prices. Core inflation has been fairly steady this year at an annual rate of about 2 percent.---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    On the supply side, despite sharp increases in prices, the production of oil has risen only slightly in the past few years. Much of the subdued supply response reflects inadequate investment and production shortfalls in politically volatile regions where large portions of the world's oil reserves are located. Additionally, many governments have been tightening their control over oil resources, impeding foreign investment and hindering efforts to boost capacity and production. Finally, sustainable rates of production in some of the more secure and accessible oil fields, such as those in the North Sea, have been declining. In view of these factors, estimates of long-term oil supplies have been marked down in recent months. Longdated oil futures prices have risen along with spot prices, suggesting that market participants also see oil supply conditions remaining tight for years to come.
    The decline in the foreign exchange value of the dollar has also contributed somewhat to the increase in oil prices. The precise size of this effect is difficult to ascertain, as the causal relationships between oil prices and the dollar are complex and run in both directions. However, the price of oil has risen significantly in terms of all major currencies, suggesting that factors other than the dollar, notably shifts in the underlying global demand for and supply of oil, have been the principal drivers of the increase in prices.
    Another concern that has been raised is that financial speculation has added markedly to upward pressures on oil prices. Certainly, investor interest in oil and other commodities has increased substantially of late. However, if financial speculation were pushing oil prices above the levels consistent with the fundamentals of supply and demand, we would expect inventories of crude oil and petroleum products to increase as supply rose and demand fell. But in fact, available data on oil inventories show notable declines over the past year. This is not to say that useful steps could not be taken to improve the transparency and functioning of futures markets, only that such steps are unlikely to substantially affect the prices of oil or other commodities in the longer term.
    Although the inflationary effect of rising oil and agricultural commodity prices is evident in the retail prices of energy and food, the extent to which the high prices of oil and other raw materials have been passed through to the prices of non-energy, non-food finished goods and services seems thus far to have been limited. But with businesses facing persistently higher input prices, they may attempt to pass through such costs into prices of final goods and services more aggressively than they have so far. Moreover, as the foreign exchange value of the dollar has declined, rises in import prices have put greater upward pressure on business costs and consumer prices. In their economic projections for the June FOMC meeting, monetary policymakers marked up their forecasts for inflation during 2008 as a whole. FOMC participants continue to expect inflation to moderate in 2009 and 2010, as slower global growth leads to a cooling of commodity markets, as pressures on resource utilization decline, and as longer-term inflation expectations remain reasonably well anchored. However, in light of the persistent escalation of commodity prices in recent quarters, FOMC participants viewed the inflation outlook as unusually uncertain and cited the possibility that commodity prices will continue to rise as an important risk to the inflation forecast. Moreover, the currently high level of inflation, if sustained, might lead the public to revise up its expectations for longer-term inflation. If that were to occur, and those revised expectations were to become embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process, we could see an unwelcome rise in actual inflation over the longer term. A critical responsibility of monetary policymakers is to prevent that process from taking hold.
    At present, accurately assessing and appropriately balancing the risks to the outlook for growth and inflation is a significant challenge for monetary policymakers. The possibility of higher energy prices, tighter credit conditions, and a still-deeper contraction in housing markets all represent significant downside risks to the outlook for growth. At the same time, upside risks to the inflation outlook have intensified lately, as the rising prices of energy and some other commodities have led to a sharp pickup in inflation and some measures of inflation expectations have moved higher. Given the high degree of uncertainty, monetary policymakers will need to carefully assess incoming information bearing on the outlook for both inflation and growth. In light of the increase in upside inflation risk, we must be particularly alert to any indications, such as an erosion of longer-term inflation expectations, that the inflationary impulses from commodity prices are becoming embedded in the domestic wage- and price-setting process.
    I would like to conclude my remarks by providing a brief update on some of the Federal Reserve's actions in the area of consumer protection. At the time of our report last February, I described the Board's proposal to adopt comprehensive new regulations to prohibit unfair or deceptive practices in the mortgage market, using our authority under the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994. After reviewing the more than 4,500 comment letters we received on the proposed rules, the Board approved the final rules yesterday.
    The new rules apply to all types of mortgage lenders and will establish lending standards aimed at curbing abuses while preserving responsible subprime lending and sustainable homeownership. The final rules prohibit lenders from making higher-priced loans without due regard for consumers' ability to make the scheduled payments and require lenders to verify the income and assets on which they rely when making the credit decision. Also, for higher-priced loans, lenders now will be required to establish escrow accounts so that property taxes and insurance costs will be included in consumers' regular monthly payments. The final rules also prohibit prepayment penalties for higher-priced loans in cases in which the consumer's payment can increase during the first few years and restrict prepayment penalties on other higher-priced loans Other measures address the coercion of appraisers, servicer practices, and other issues. We believe the new rules will help to restore confidence in the mortgage market.
    In May, working jointly with the Office of Thrift Supervision and the National Credit Union Administration, the Board issued proposed rules under the Federal Trade Commission Act to address unfair or deceptive practices for credit card accounts and overdraft protection plans. Credit cards provide a convenient source of credit for many consumers, but the terms of credit card loans have become more complex, which has reduced transparency. Our consumer testing has persuaded us that disclosures alone cannot solve this problem. Thus, the Board's proposed rules would require card issuers to alter their practices in ways that will allow consumers to better understand how their own decisions and actions will affect their costs. Card issuers would be prohibited from increasing interest rates retroactively to cover prior purchases except under very limited circumstances. For accounts having multiple interest rates, when consumers seek to pay down their balance by paying more than the minimum, card issuers would be prohibited from maximizing interest charges by applying excess payments to the lowest rate balance first. The proposed rules dealing with bank overdraft services seek to give consumers greater control by ensuring that they have ample opportunity to opt out of automatic payments of overdrafts. The Board has already received more than 20,000 comment letters in response to the proposed rules.
    Thank you. I would be pleased to take your questions.
        RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR SHELBY
                      FROM BEN S. BERNANKEQ.1. Inflation: Mr. Chairman, I have great concerns about inflation. Inflation degrades consumer's purchasing power and reduces the value of many investments, including people's homes. Additionally, continued food and energy price increases can have negative effects on consumer confidence and potentially unhinge inflation expectations.
    How large of a shift in expectations would the FOMC have to see before it began to tighten the target for the Federal Funds rate?
    Please comment on whether you have observed a pass-through of higher input prices for commodities and energy in the form of higher prices for finished goods?A.1. The inflationary effects of the sharp increases in oil and agricultural commodity prices earlier this year are clearly evident in the retail prices of energy and food. In particular, the PCE price index for food and beverages increased almost 6 percent over the 12 months ending in August 2008, while the PCE price index for energy moved up 28 percent over that same period. The acceleration in the price indexes for these two components of spending accounted for much of the pickup in the 12-month change in the overall PCE price index to 4.5 percent in August 2008 from 2 percent over the 12 months ending in August 2007.
    It appears that, to some extent, the earlier increases in the prices of oil and other raw materials have been passed through to the prices of non-energy, non-food finished goods and services. Prices for consumer items that have a high energy content--such as airfares and other transportation services, housekeeping supplies, and household operations--have moved up noticeably this year; moreover, energy and other basic input costs could well have pushed up prices for a range of other items for which the direct effect of commodity prices is more difficult to identify. In the aggregate, the PCE price index excluding food and energy rose at an annual rate of 2.6 percent over the 12 months ending in August 2008, about one-half percentage point faster than over the 12 months ending in August 2007.
    Thus far, however, we have not seen the sort of run up in labor compensation and inflation expectations that could lead to a deterioration in the longer term outlook for inflation. In particular, although some indicators of inflation expectations have increased, long-term inflation expectations still appear to be reasonably well anchored. Indeed, given the recent sharp declines in the prices for crude oil and other commodities and the weakening in economic conditions, the FOMC believes that inflation is likely to moderate later this year and in 2009. Of course, the Committee will continue to monitor the incoming information on inflation and inflation expectations carefully.Q.2. Update on Bear Stearns: Chairman Bernanke, the Federal Reserve created a limited liability corporation (Maiden Lane LLC) to acquire and manage certain assets from Bear Stearns, with the goal of maximizing repayment of the original loan back to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. We all hope that this loan will be repaid in its entirety through the sale of these assets over time.
    How has the value of the Bear Stearns portfolio changed over time?
    In the few months since this transaction occurred, has anything changed that would lead to a reassessment of potential losses?A.2. As indicated in the Federal Reserve's weekly H.4.1 statistical releases, the fair value of the net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC was $29.816 billion as of March 14, 2008, $28.893 billion as of June 26, 2008, and $29.018 billion as of June 30, 2008. The Federal Reserve will publish in the H.4.1 statistical release an updated fair value of the net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC as of the end of each calendar quarter. The fair value of the net portfolio holdings of Maiden Lane LLC was $26.979 billion as of November 26, 2008, which reflects valuations as of September 30, 2008.
    As more fully explained in my testimony before the Committee on April 3, 2008, the Federal Reserve decided to finance a portion of Bear Stearns' assets to facilitate the acquisition of the firm by JPMorgan Chase to address the severe consequences that likely would have resulted from a disorderly liquidation of the firm in the unusually fragile circumstances that then prevailed. In taking this action, the Federal Reserve consulted closely with the Treasury Department.
    In order to maximize the returns to the Federal Reserve and the taxpayer, the Federal Reserve has engaged an independent portfolio management firm to professionally manage the assets held by Maiden Lane LLC. The assets will be managed with a long-term time horizon of at least 10 years. Although the value of the portfolio declined between March 14, 2008, and June 30, 2008, given the long-term time horizon for the portfolio it is too early to estimate what, if any, net losses might result from the eventual liquidation of the portfolio. Importantly, as previously announced, JPMorgan Chase will bear the first $1 billion of any losses on the collateral pool.Q.3. Negative Real Interest Rates: Chairman Bernanke, real interest rates appear to be negative at present, since the nominal short-term rate is lower than inflation.
    Does having a negative real rate of interest during a period of increased inflation harm the Fed's ability to work towards maintaining price stability?
    For how long can the Fed run a negative real interest rate before inflation pressures grow to dangerous levels?A.3. The FOMC has judged the current level of short-term interest rates as appropriate in light of its statutory objectives of maximum employment and price stability. Relatively low real short-term interest rates are currently necessary to counter the adverse effects of the broad range of factors restraining aggregate spending and output. Such factors include severe strains on financial markets and institutions, tight credit conditions, the ongoing housing correction, and elevated energy prices, which reduce households' discretionary income. As such, we do not believe that the current low level of real short-term interest rates is likely to have an adverse effect on the economy. Clearly, the highly accommodative stance of monetary policy cannot be maintained indefinitely. But, in view of the expectation for inflation to decline, such a stance is appropriate for a time to help foster moderate economic growth in the face of the range of factors that is restraining growth. The Committee believes that inflation is likely to moderate later this year and during 2009 as the effect of recent sharp drops in the prices of energy and other commodity prices shows through to broad price indexes and as slack in the economy resulting from slower economic growth reduces pressure on resources.Q.4. FOMC Statement Bias: Mr. Chairman, in the FOMC's most recent statement, the Committee seemed to shift its bias away from concerns over slower growth, towards concern about inflation and inflation expectations.
    Would you elaborate on what this shift means for future policy decisions?
    Additionally, how long would inflation rates have to stay elevated for the Committee to display unambiguous bias towards alleviating inflation concerns?A.4. In conducting monetary policy, the Committee carefully monitors ongoing developments in the economy and financial markets that influence the outlook for the economy and inflation. From time to time, the Federal Reserve adjusts its policy stance in view of the evolving economic outlook and risks to the outlook. After each meeting, the Committee issues a statement that explains any adjustment to its policy stance and characterizes the outlook for economic growth and inflation. In the period before the June meeting, incoming economic data had indicated that economic growth in the second quarter was stronger than had been expected. Also, financial market conditions appeared to have improved somewhat, although markets clearly remained under stress. Meanwhile, oil prices had increased further. In these circumstances, the Committee judged at its June meeting that the downside risks to growth diminished and the upside risks to inflation had increased.
    An important uncertainty in the outlook for inflation is whether the current elevated level of total inflation may lead to upward pressure on longer-term inflation expectations. At present, although some indicators of inflation expectations have increased, long-term inflation expectations still appear to be reasonably well anchored. However, the Committee is monitoring inflation and inflation expectations very carefully.
                                ------                                
        RESPONSE TO WRITTEN QUESTIONS OF SENATOR BUNNING
                      FROM BEN S. BERNANKEQ.1. The number and severity of credit rating downgrades from credit rating agencies in the last year casts doubt on the reliability of such ratings. What is the Fed doing to verify the credit rating of the collateral you are accepting at the various Fed facilities?A.1. The Federal Reserve regularly updates the credit ratings of assets pledged as collateral and uses multiple ratings rather than just one. Assets are regularly marked to market and haircuts are applied to provide adequate protection against market, liquidity, and credit risks. In cases where ratings are less reliable, we require a higher rating than we would otherwise. It should be noted that the entire pool of collateral pledged by a depository institution secures any loans to that institution; moreover, the Federal Reserve has recourse to the borrower under all of its lending facilities beyond the specific collateral pledged.
    Although credit ratings are one determinant of the eligibility of collateral pledged to Federal Reserve liquidity facilities, Reserve Banks also perform independent credit analysis when receiving collateral and especially when extending a loan to a depository institution. That analysis is based on publicly available information as well as on supervisory information on both the quality of the collateral and on the financial condition of the pledging institution.Q.2. In 2006, Congress passed the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act, which created a formal process for recognizing and examining credit rating agencies with a goal of increasing competition and rating quality. Under that law, the SEC has now recognized 10 National Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations. However, the Fed only accepts credit ratings from the three largest rating agencies for collateral taken at the various Fed facilities. Why does the Fed not accept ratings from the other approved agencies? Are there any plans to revisit that prohibition?A.2. The Federal Reserve accepts a very large volume of collateral, and it is critically important to be able to access credit ratings and other information on a timely basis in a fully automated fashion. The Federal Reserve is open to utilizing credit ratings of all NRSROs consistent with this basic requirement.Q.3. Given the concerns about the government-sponsored entities that led the Fed to grant them access to a lending facility and the Treasury Department to ask for rescue legislation, has the Fed changed its practices on accepting GSE-backed securities as collateral at the Fed facilities? Have you increased the collateral required when GSE-backed collateral is posted?A.3. Securities issued or guaranteed by the GSEs remain eligible collateral at the Federal Reserve's various liquidity support facilities. The market prices of GSE securities pledged as collateral are regularly updated and the haircuts are determined to provide the Federal Reserve with adequate protection against market, liquidity, and credit risk. The haircuts applied to collateral pledged by depository institutions to the discount window are regularly recalibrated by the Federal Reserve, and it has not been necessary to change those applied to GSE-related securities. Haircuts applied to securities pledged by primary dealers for repurchase agreements, the primary dealer credit facility, and the term securities lending facility are chosen to be consistent with, but slightly more conservative than, market practice.[GRAPHIC(S) NOT AVAILABLE IN TIFF FORMAT]"
