"Chairman Shelby","The hearing will come to order. We are very pleased this morning to welcome Chairman Bernanke before the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to provide his first testimony on the Federal Reserve Semiannual Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. On behalf of this Committee, I want to congratulate Dr. Bernanke on becoming only the 14th Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. This Committee has had the opportunity to work with you in your previous tenure as Board Governor and as Chairman of the Council on Economic Advisors. We look forward to continuing that good and productive relationship as you guide the Federal Reserve System over the next years. Our hearing this morning serves as an important part of the Committee's oversight function over the Federal Reserve System. It is also an important mechanism for assuring that Congress maintains accountability over the Fed's policies and operations. Within broad statutory parameters, the Fed sets and implements U.S. monetary policy independent from the Congress and the President. This hearing, which is also required by statute, provides the Congress an opportunity to have an open and detailed discussion and debate about the Fed's monetary policy goals and their implementation. Chairman Bernanke, your testimony and report this morning note the economy's impressive performance in 2005. GDP growth continues to be strong and core inflation remain moderate. We also saw continued improvement in the labor markets with the number of jobs created and a low unemployment rate. At its meeting on January 31, the Federal Open Market Committee raised its target for the Federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5 percent. This is the 14th increase since June 2004 when the FOMC began raising the target rate from a low of 1 percent. The Federal Open Market Committee will meet next at the end of March, its first session under your leadership. Clearly, new economic data will be reported and other events will transpire between now and then so you cannot tell us exactly what will happen at that meeting and you should not. However, our discussion this morning gives us the opportunity to discuss which factors will be significant in your deliberations leading up to that meeting. In that sense, we hope our hearing and discussion this morning can add to the transparency of the FOMC process. Mr. Chairman, this Committee is eager to hear your views on the future direction of our Nation's economy and how you plan to guide the Federal Reserve System in the months and years ahead. I look forward to raising a number of issues during our discussion this morning. Senator Reed, do you have an opening statement?","Speech",""
"Senator Reed","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and thank you, Chairman Bernanke. Welcome and congratulations. You come to this job, Mr. Chairman, with considerable bipartisan goodwill, with very strong academic credentials, and a reputation for independent thinking, and you will need to draw on all these resources as you confront an economy that seems to be humming along on the surface, but in fact there is a number of lurking problems, problems such as large budget deficits, a record trade deficit, negative household saving rate, high energy prices, and a disappointing labor market recovery. All of these pose tremendous challenges in setting monetary policy. We welcome your championship of greater openness and demystification of the Fed. You really assured us during the confirmation process that you are sensitive to the multiple goals of monetary policy so I hope that you will continue the Greenspan model of responding to changing economic circumstances with flexibility rather than a rigid adherence to a predetermined policy. Now, critical tests will be balancing the goals of fighting inflation with allowing sufficient employment growth. These are difficult economic times for many Americans who are facing stagnant incomes, rising costs for health care, rising costs of home heating, rising costs for education, and so I hope, Chairman Bernanke, that you will look hard at the economic data at the FOMC meetings rather than allowing some type of rigid plan to take hold. GDP is growing, but the typical American worker has been left out of the economic gains of this recovery. Strong proprietary gains have shown up in the bottom lines of shareholders but not in the paychecks of many workers. Clearly, there is room for real wages to catch up with productivity before the Fed needs to worry about inflationary pressure from the labor market. Finally, I hope you keep your promise to not comment on the public policy matters beyond the realm of monetary policy and to remain politically independent. I think that will be a major service to the Nation. I look forward to your discussion about the issues that are important to all of us today and thank you, again, for not only attending but also your service.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JACK REED"
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Bunning.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Chairman Bernanke, to your first appearance before this Committee as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. I would like to point out that at the beginning of your hearing yesterday, the stock market indexes jumped and then fell throughout the hearing. Fortunately, after it was over they recovered and ended up back in positive territory. On the way out the door last month, Chairman Greenspan left us with another hike in interest rates to 4.5 percent. His recent comments, which came at a much higher price to his fellow diners than the taxpayers, seem to have tied your hands at the beginning of your term. You will not chair your first FOMC meeting until next month, but it is already taken for granted that another rate hike is coming and probably more after that. As I told Mr. Greenspan at his last appearance before this Committee, I do not think that increases are needed, especially with your projections of reasonable inflation for the coming year. I hope they do not continue until it is too late and damage is done. Our economy is strong and inflation is low, despite high energy prices. Several other factors pose dangers to sustained economic growth in the short and long terms. We all know that inverted yield curves have been a reliable indicator of trouble ahead. Increased Federal budget deficits cause uncertainty and long-term obligations will begin to soak up more and more capital that could be put to other productive uses. And our trade deficit means that we are more dependent on other countries to sustain our lifestyle and could lead to job loss if we do not begin to close the gap. Even with those negative factors hanging out there, the Fed paints a strong picture of the economy. During your confirmation process, I urged you to be independent of the other Fed Members, as well as Congress and the executive branch. I also stressed the importance of further openness at the Fed and the tolerance of other viewpoints. In other words, I would like to see less group-think. I criticized your predecessor for speaking out of place when it comes to policy matters that do not belong to the Fed. I encourage you to stay away from those discussions and I am glad that to some extent you did so yesterday. Something about this town makes people want to be liked. The longer someone stays here, the more they seem to want to be liked. Maybe it has something to do with one day getting paid more than your previous salary for attending a few dinners and not even having to pay for your own food. Do not fall into that trap and do not be afraid to tell people ``no.'' It is an uncommon thing to say around here, but do not try to follow in the footsteps of your predecessor. In other words, be yourself, do not be ``Greenspan-lite.'' I hope when your time at the Fed is over people will look back and see a record of doing no harm. I think the decisions you and the other Board Members make in the next few months will have a lot to do with the success of your leadership at the Fed. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I look forward to asking some questions.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JIM BUNNING"

"Senator Menendez","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Chairman, welcome, congratulations. We are pleased to welcome you, as a fellow New Jersian, and we know that you will do an exceptional job in this regard. I certainly look forward to your testimony today and to some of the challenges I think we face: The cooling off of the housing market and what that may mean, rising energy prices, consequences of deficit and debt, a variety of global influences, and a dynamic, modern economy that we have. Those are all the challenges that you face before you and so we look forward to your stewardship in meeting, having a steady hand in the midst of all of the dynamic realities that we face, so we look forward to hearing your testimony, and once again congratulations on your appointment, Mr. Chairman.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR ROBERT MENENDEZ"

"Senator Sununu","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and welcome,","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN E. SUNUNU"
"Chairman Bernanke","Yesterday, you touched briefly on issues related to the GSE's, better regulation of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. This is something that has been of interest to the Committee. We enacted legislation that you spoke to at the hearing yesterday, and I note that you emphasized two specific concerns with the portfolios held by the GSE's, one, the systemic risk that they create inevitably because of the nature of the portfolios carrying interest rate risk and prepayment risk, and two, the fact that they really do not contribute directly to the GSE's fulfilling their mission. I appreciate you making these points, some points that are very consistent with testimony and presentation by other representatives from the Fed in the past, and I think it is important because we have an opportunity to take up legislation this year, probably the best opportunity to improve the regulation of these large institutions that we will have in a long time. Mr. Chairman, I have a letter that I received from the outgoing Fed Chairman speaking to these issues at the beginning of January. I would ask that that be included in the record so that I do not have to belabor these points in any greater detail.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","It will be part of the record without objection.","Speech"," "

"Chairman Bernanke","This is an important time and we wish you all of the best as we all work together on so many issues that relate to our economy and what is happening in terms of monetary policy. The Annual Monetary Policy Report comes at a very important time for many middle class Americans, and I know in my home State right now, the headlines everyday relate to manufacturing loss in Michigan and families are feeling squeezed on all sides from concerns about losing their job, losing their pension, their health care costs rising, businesses, manufacturers seeing their health care costs go through the roof basically, and it relates to their ability to compete internationally. We also know that issues of unfair trade practices are not just words for us in manufacturing. In Michigan, things like currency manipulation are real with Japan or with China when we look at the differences in costs coming in. Counterfeiting, counterfeit auto parts, which is a $12 billion business costs us 200,000 jobs. So when we look at all of the issues, the fact that we have lost 2.4 million jobs, 2.4 million people plus their families. Since 2000, we have lost over 200,000 jobs, families experiencing layoffs in the last 5 years in my State alone. Just last year, 21,000 manufacturing jobs were lost. I say this because the trade deficit is a critical issue for us, a trade deficit now that is about twice as much as the budget deficit, the budget deficit being the highest in our Nation's history, but the trade deficit now hitting $726 billion. This is real for us and so I know your basket of economic metrics, the international component, is just a piece of the analysis, but I want to stress with you that this is extremely important piece to us in manufacturing and in Michigan. And I hope your analysis now and in the future will consider the global issues that are devastating middle class families and devastating American businesses. We need to be focused on that. We need your leadership, your thoughts, and your recommendations as it relates to this global economy now and the international pressures, the unfair trade practices, the currency manipulation, other kinds of issues in the economy, the way we fund health care which is different than any other country in the world, and the impact on our businesses. All of these issues come down on the people that I represent, my own family in Michigan and the others that I represent, and so I hope this international component of your analysis is something that you will place an emphasis on and work with us on as we address monetary issues and the economy in America. Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Thank you, Senator. Senator Dole.","Speech"," "
"Senator Dole","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Chairman Bernanke, a very warm welcome to you. I certainly look forward to working with you very closely in the months and years to come, and I have every confidence in you. I want to underscore what Senator Sununu said about the GSE's, and one of the issues that I raised when we met in November was the economic transition that we are going through in North Carolina. We continue to experience job loss, especially in textiles and furniture manufacturing. The national economy is indeed trending positively, but I think we must continue to focus special attention on the areas where people have lost their jobs, where companies struggle to compete with foreign firms, and their dramatically lower cost structures. We have to work toward trade agreements that benefit American workers and consumers and support jobs and growth in our domestic industries. One issue I was focused on during my days as Secretary of Labor was addressing the growing gap between skilled and unskilled workers. Today in our changing economic environment, this gap has unfortunately widened, and as our economy moves forward, the opportunities for lower skilled workers are diminishing. We have to do everything in our power to ensure that these people realize new opportunities, educate our less skilled workers so they can take advantage of the new jobs that are being created. To this end, I believe that we should take steps to improve trade adjustment assistance and continue to make strengthening our community colleges a top priority, and I might add that the Labor Department has estimated that 80 percent of new jobs that are going to be created over the next decade will require postsecondary education. Now, in my conversations with many North Carolinians, I hear concerns about job creation, high energy and health care costs, and our growing trade imbalance. I continue to have confidence that the very forces that stimulate economic growth--tax relief to spur investment, free but fair trade, ever-improving global communications, higher education and training for our workforce, and of course hard work--these forces indeed will put us on a course toward greater opportunity for North Carolina and this Nation. Mr. Chairman, thank you for being here today. I look forward to your testimony and again to working closely with you. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR ELIZABETH DOLE"
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Carper.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","Thanks, Mr. Chairman. Welcome. It is good to have you back. Thank you for joining us today and again for your service to our country. I think others have indicated that they have an interest in questioning you on some of these same subjects. I will mention them again. I will be asking you about our savings rate or really our lack of savings or negative savings rate and what you think we are doing right to turn that around and maybe what more we could do or should do. I want to also visit the issue, the interplay between the trade deficit and the budget deficit, and the potential effect of doing the wrong thing or not doing the right thing with respect to interest rates going forward. Playing into the trade deficit, our growing reliance on foreign oil. I think I read the other day that our trade deficit for last year topped out at a little bit more than $700 billion and roughly a third of that is now our reliance on foreign oil. And others have suggested--I think Senator Dole and I believe Senator Sununu have mentioned the regulatory structure for Government Sponsored Enterprises, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and some of our Federal Home Loan Banks--and I understand, I read in a news account that you addressed that in your testimony before the House of Representatives, but I want us to have a chance maybe to talk with you a bit further about that today. And finally, just some general thoughts. Maybe put on your old hat from one of your last jobs about economic policy, and just to talk about some steps we need to take if our country is going to continue to be an economic superpower in this century, what we are doing right and what we are doing wrong, and what we need to do differently, more of or less of. Welcome. Thanks for coming.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR THOMAS R. CARPER"

"Senator Crapo","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman, and Chairman Bernanke, I welcome you to your first appearance before this Committee. I look forward to many more and appreciate the opportunity we have already had to work together on important issues, and I am certain that the forecast and information that you will give us today will be very helpful to us. I share a lot of the other feelings that have already been expressed to you so I will not repeat them now. There are two issues that I wanted to raise in addition to those, and if I am here when it is time for questions, I will go through this a little more in questions, but I have three hearings going on today, one with a member of the cabinet, one with the U.S. Trade Ambassador, and one with yourself. And they are all going on right now. So if I slip out to try to catch a little bit of one of those other hearings and miss the chance to ask you questions, I wanted to just toss these two things out right now. We are getting very close to a markup on the regulatory reform legislation that we have been working on for several years now, and we are talking, I think, in terms of weeks, not months, before we are going to move forward, and I would like to have some kind of an indication from you as to when the Federal Reserve will be able to give us its comments on the proposals that are out there. So, I just toss that one out to you. And then the second issue is one which you will probably hear me talk to you a lot about as we have opportunities, and that is the question of derivatives. I am very concerned about the potential efforts in this Congress to change the manner in which we regulate derivatives or to impact the manner in which derivatives operate in the economy, and I would like to have your comments on the importance of having a strong, stable, and dynamic derivatives market in this country and what it means to our economy. So, again, in addition to the other issues that we have talked about, those are just a couple specific ones that I would like you to think about. If I am not here to ask questions, maybe we can talk later at a different time. Thank you.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR MIKE CRAPO"

"Senator Sarbanes","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I join my colleagues in welcoming Chairman Bernanke before the Committee. I think we had him last year at his nomination hearing in November, and given the schedule, he went to the House first, not by his choice. That was the process, I hasten to add, so that the Members of the Committee do not feel slighted in any way, but actually I want to say just a word about that. We think the Semiannual Report by the Fed is a very important step forward in the transparency and oversight with respect to monetary policy. It was a change that Chairman Greenspan welcomed at the time, and I think I recall we had talked about that, and you indicated very strong support for that process as well. And I think it does give the public a chance on a regular basis for the Fed to come before the Congress and spell out its views with respect to monetary policy and the health of the economy. And Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your oversight and focus in that regard. It is clearly important.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR PAUL S. SARBANES"
"Chairman Shelby","I had a good trainer.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","The Federal Reserve has a double mandate, as we all know: Stable prices and maximum employment. And we have seen in recent years that the goals are not inherently in conflict, as some had argued in the past, and we got unemployment down to below 4 percent actually, inflation below 3 percent, and at his hearing, Dr. Bernanke told the Committee, and I quote him, that he ``subscribes entirely to the Humphrey- Hawkins mandate which puts employment growth and output growth on a fully equal footing with inflation in terms of the Federal Reserve's objectives.'' And we look forward to working with him in that regard. I am a little concerned about how sanguine we are about the economy. Paul Volcker not long ago in an editorial in the Washington Post said this about our economy: Under the placid surface, there are disturbing trends, huge imbalances, disequilibria, risks, call them what you will, although the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember, and I can remember quite a lot. Of course, the Commerce Department recently reported that our Nation ran a record trade deficit of over $725 billion last year. Warren Buffett summarized the situation: ``Right now the rest of the world owns  three trillion more of us than we own of them. In my view, it will create political turmoil at some point. Pretty soon, I think there will be a big adjustment.'' And I hope to go into that with Chairman Bernanke when we reach the question period or in subsequent meetings, but we welcome you back before the Committee as Chairman of the Fed, and we wish you well in this new responsibility. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "

That is quite an accomplishment. Second, I want to follow up on something that Senator Sarbanes mentioned. I am increasingly concerned with some of the global imbalances that are accumulating and their effect not only on our potential economic performance but also on our Nation's security. I am going to save my time for questions, but I would like to delve into that with you later today and perhaps at a later point. Having said that, I have learned from hard experience that we are all here to hear from you, not from me, and so I would just congratulate you and welcome you again.","Statement","STATEMENT OF SENATOR EVAN BAYH"

"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you. Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am pleased to be here today to present the Federal Reserve's Monetary Policy Report to the Congress. I look forward to working closely with the Members of this Committee on issues of monetary policy as well as on matters regarding the other responsibilities with which the Congress has charged the Federal Reserve System. The U.S. economy performed impressively in 2005. Real gross domestic product increased a bit more than 3 percent, building on the sustained expansion that gained traction in the middle of 2003. Payroll employment rose two million in 2005 and the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent. Productivity continued to advance briskly. The economy achieved these gains despite some significant obstacles. Energy prices rose substantially yet again in response to the increasing global demand, hurricane-related disruptions to production, and concerns about the adequacy and reliability of supply. The Gulf Coast region suffered through severe hurricanes that inflicted a terrible loss of life, destroyed homes, personal property, businesses and infrastructure on a massive scale, and displaced more than a million people. The storms also damaged facilities and disrupted production in many industries with substantial effects on the energy and petrochemical sectors and on the region's ports. Full recovery in the affected areas is likely to be slow. The hurricanes left an imprint on aggregate economic activity as well, seen in part in the marked deceleration of real GDP in the fourth quarter. However, the most recent evidence, including indicators of production, the flow of new orders to businesses, weekly data on initial claims for unemployment insurance, and the payroll employment and retail sales figures for January, suggest that the economic expansion remains on track. Inflation pressures increased in 2005. Steeply rising energy prices pushed up overall inflation, raised business costs, and squeezed household budgets. Nevertheless, the increase in prices for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, at just below 2 percent, remained moderate, and longer-term inflation expectations appear to have been contained. With the economy expanding at a solid pace, resource utilization rising, cost pressures increasing, and short-term interest rates still relatively low, the Federal Open Market Committee over the course of 2005 continued the process of removing monetary policy accommodation, raising the Federal funds rate 2 percentage points in eight increments of 25 basis points each. At its meeting on January 31 of this year, the FOMC raised the Federal funds rate another one-quarter percentage point, bringing its level to 4\1/2\ percent. At that meeting, monetary policymakers also discussed the economic outlook for the next 2 years. The central tendency of the forecast of Members of the Board of Governors and the Presidents of the Federal Reserve Banks is for real GDP to increase about 3\1/2\ percent in 2006 and 3 percent to 3\1/2\ percent in 2007. The civilian unemployment rate is expected to finish both 2006 and 2007 at a level between 4\3/4\ percent and 5 percent. Inflation, as measured by the price index for personal consumption expenditures excluding food and energy, is predicted to be about 2 percent this year and 1\3/4\ percent to 2 percent next year. While considerable uncertainty surrounds any economic forecast extending nearly 2 years, I am comfortable with these projections. In the announcement following the January 31 meeting, the Federal Reserve pointed to risks that could add to inflation pressures. Among those risks is the possibility that to a greater extent than we now anticipate, higher energy prices may pass through into the prices of nonenergy goods and services or have a persistent effect on inflation expectations. Another factor bearing on the inflation outlook is that the economy appears now to be operating at a relatively high level of resource utilization. Gauging the economy's sustainable potential is difficult and the Federal Reserve will keep a close eye on all the relevant evidence and be flexible in making those judgments. Nevertheless, the risk exists that with aggregate demand exhibiting considerable momentum, output could overshoot its sustainable path, leading ultimately--in the absence of countervailing monetary policy action--to further upward pressure on inflation. In these circumstances, the FOMC judged that some further firming of monetary policy may be necessary, an assessment with which I concur. Not all of the risks to the economy concern inflation. For example, a number of indicators point to a slowing in the housing market. Some cooling of the housing market is to be expected and would not be inconsistent with continued solid growth of overall economic activity. However, given the substantial gains in house prices, and the high levels of home construction activity over the past several years, prices and construction could decelerate more rapidly than currently seems likely. Slower growth in home equity, in turn, might lead households to boost their saving and trim their spending relative to current income by more than is now anticipated. The possibility of significant further increases in energy prices represents an additional risk to the economy. Besides affecting inflation, such increases might also hurt consumer confidence and thereby reduce spending on nonenergy goods and services. Although the outlook contains significant uncertainties, it is clear substantial progress has been made in removing monetary policy accommodation. As a consequence, in coming quarters, the FOMC will have to make ongoing, provisional judgments about the risks to both inflation and growth, and monetary actions will be increasingly dependent on incoming data. As I noted, core inflation has been moderate despite sharp increases in energy prices. A key factor in this regard has been confidence on the part of public and investors in the prospects for price stability. Maintaining expectations of low and stable inflation is an essential element in the Federal Reserve's effort to promote price stability, and thus far the news has been good. Measures of longer-term inflation expectations have responded only a little to larger fluctuations in energy prices that we have experienced, and for the most part they were low and stable last year. Inflation prospects are important, not just because price stability is in itself desirable and part of the Federal Reserve's mandate from the Congress, but also because price stability is essential for strong and stable growth of output and employment. Stable prices promote long-term economic growth by allowing households and firms to make economic decisions and undertake productive activities with fewer concerns about large or unanticipated changes in the price level and their attendant financial consequences. Experience shows that low and stable inflation and inflation expectations are also associated with greater short-term stability and output and employment, perhaps in part because they give the central bank greater latitude to counter transitory disturbances to the economy. Similarly, the attainment of the statutory goal of moderate long-term interest rates requires price stability, because only then are the inflation premiums that investors demand for holding long-term instruments kept to a minimum. In sum, achieving price stability is not only important in itself; but it is also central to attaining the Federal Reserve's other mandated objectives of maximum sustainable employment and moderate long- term interest rates. As always, however, translating the Federal Reserve's general economic objectives into operational decisions about the stance of monetary policy poses many challenges. Over the past few decades, policymakers have learned that no single economic or financial indicator or even a small set of such indicators can provide reliable guidance for the setting of monetary policy. Rather, the Federal Reserve, together with all modern central banks, has found that the successful conduct of monetary policy requires painstaking examination of a broad range of economic and financial data, careful consideration of the implications of those data for the likely path of the economy and inflation, and prudent judgment regarding the effects of alternative courses of policy action on the prospects for achieving our macroeconomic objectives. In that process, economic models can provide valuable guidance to policymakers and over the years substantial progress has been made in developing formal models and forecasting techniques. But any model is by necessity a simplification of the real world and sufficient data are seldom available to measure even the basic relationships with precision. Monetary policymakers must therefore strike a difficult balance, conducting rigorous analysis informed by sound economic theory and empirical methods while keeping an open mind about the many factors including myriad global influences at play in a dynamic modern economy like that of the United States. Amid significant uncertainty, we must formulate a view of the most likely course of the economy under a given policy approach while giving due weight the potential risks and associated costs to the economy should those judgments turn out to be wrong. During the 3 years that I previously spent as a Member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Open Market Committee, the approach to policy that I have just outlined was standard operating procedure under the highly successful leadership of","Statement","STATEMENT OF BEN S.

"Chairman Shelby","Mr. Chairman, we are in our last few minutes of a vote on the floor. We are going to recess and we will probably be back in 15 or 20 minutes, soon as we can get here. The hearing will stand in recess.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","The hearing will come back to order. Mr. Chairman, some Fed watchers speculate that the Federal Open Market Committee may--may--continue to increase its Federal funds rate target to 5 percent while others seem to believe that 5.5 percent may be likely. Do you regard either of these speculations regarding the level as more likely than the other giving the FOMC forecast that you have outlined today?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, in the statement following the January 31 meeting, the Committee pointed to some potential pressures on inflation and suggested that some additional firming may be necessary. However, as you know, it is still about 6 weeks until the next FOMC meeting.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","You will have to examine the data at that----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We will be examining the data as it comes in and, of course, my colleagues and I will have an extensive discussion and we will be thinking about both our inflation mandate and our full employment mandate as we make our decision.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","To what extent, Mr. Chairman, does the Federal Open Market Committee consider the long-term interest rate in pursuing changes to the Federal funds rate? For example, would the FOMC continue raising the Federal funds rate even if the yield curve remains inverted in the months ahead and will that be a factor or is that bothersome to you, the inverted yield?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, the inversion of the yield curve is due to a number of different factors which have different implications for policy.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","But historically they meant something? Senator Bunning alluded to that earlier.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","That is true that historically an inverted yield curve has often predicted slowing economic activity. That relationship seems to have weakened in the past 15 years or so.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Why?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, one of the reasons, as we looked into it, is that the inverted yield curve is more likely to be indicative of coming slowing when interest rates in general are high, when real rates in general are high, because when real rates in general are high, that tends to restrain activity. We have an inverted yield curve at this point. It is due to a number of factors which I can go into, if you are interested, but the short-term, real interest rate is in a fairly normal range and the long-term real interest rate is actually relatively low historically speaking. So we are not overly concerned about the implications of the inverted yield curve for future economic activity.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Mr. Chairman, your testimony also notes the possibility of some risk which could add to inflationary pressures such as high energy prices feeding into the prices of nonenergy goods and services. Your testimony further notes the risk to our economy due to a slowing housing market you reference. What would be the impact on the economy if both of these effects materialize to a greater degree than is currently anticipated? How would the Federal Reserve be likely to respond to such a scenario if you found the pressure there from a double hit?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","That would be a difficult situation because, on the one hand, higher energy prices would put pressure on inflation, but higher energy prices would also hurt consumer budgets and would probably or could possibly lead consumers to spend less. Together with weakening of the housing market, which might also lead to a higher savings rate and slower consumption spending, we would be in a situation with pressures in both directions, and I cannot really offer much more guidance other than to say that we would have to weigh the relative severity of the two risks.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","If they were to come about?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","If they both were to come about, and then try to manage those risks in a way that would give us the best outcome.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","You reference further in your testimony your thoughts on global savings glut, with this glut being part of the reason that the real interest rate in global markets is low. In other words, there is a lot of money out there. How does this factor into the Federal Reserve's growth projections and how would you envision economic events unfolding to bring returns back to more historical normal levels?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, we were just discussing the relatively low level of long-term real interest rates. I think one of the factors relevant to the long-term, low, real interest rates is that there is a lot of savings coming into the global capital market, from emerging market economies and from oil producers, which is looking for returns. I think that over time, as the global economy continues to grow and as those economies find more investment opportunities in their domestic economies, that some of this global savings glut may begin to dissipate, but I think that is likely to be a relatively gradual process.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Yesterday, did the market behavior reflect an accurate interpretation of the Federal Reserve's report and your comments? Do you think it is a good outcome when markets receive enough signals to know what to expect about monetary policy? Is that a prediction?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We are trying, and we have been for some time trying, to be transparent and as clear as we can about our strategy, our objectives, and our approach, and one of the implications of that has been that interest rate moves have been highly predicted by the markets, and I think, as a general matter, that is good. It reduces volatility in financial markets and makes policy actually more effective.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Bunning.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I would like to go back to the inverted yield curve for a minute. You were a professor at this time. Maybe you remember this at Princeton. In 1989, if I am wrong, I think you were a professor at Princeton.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, sir.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In 1989, even as the economy slowed, the Fed continued to raise interest rates, and we had a recession. The signs of the economic problems were ignored. Yesterday, you stated that the inverted yield curve was ``not signaling'' a slowdown. Those were your words--``not signaling.'' But in recent economic history, the inverted yield curve has predicted a recession, not just sometimes, but almost every time. Now, the Fed has pushed interest rates to the highest level in 4\1/2\ years. The January rate hike was the 14th consecutive 25 basis point move since the Fed began raising interest rates in June 2004. You said you think we are not facing a downturn because interest rates are lower now than in past inversions. Do you have any other reason to think that this inverted yield curve is not a warning, any other reason, other than we started lower?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, Senator. As I was indicating in my testimony, we look at a wide variety of indicators. We do look at the structure of interest rates and other financial asset market prices, but we also look at a wide variety of indicators in the real economy, and we are seeing very low unemployment insurance claims, for example, and we are seeing strong retail sales. We are seeing increased industrial production. My comments notwithstanding about slowing of the housing market, the level of activity in housing construction remains strong, and so the economic expansion appears still to be on a solid track. When we make policy, we have to think not only about all these indicators, but we also have to think in terms of a forecast. We look ahead and try to think where the economy is likely to be at a period 6 months, a year, 18 months in the future, and based on that forecast and the risk to that forecast, we try to pick the best policy.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","You know as well as I do that normal everyday citizens do not borrow at the Fed funds rate, but about a 300 basis point markup from that. So if Fed funds get to 5\1/2\ percent, the prime rate for borrowing would be about 8\1/2\ percent. I do not know too many Americans that can borrow at 8\1/2\ percent on prime rate. Most Americans pay prime plus. So we are getting to the point, if the Fed moves two more times, and Fed funds increase 25 basis points and 25 basis points, we are to that point, eight plus on prime. Do you find that disturbing to the economy or would that be just normal for our economic outlook?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, Senator, again, the choices we make will be conditioned on our views of where the economy is going and what interest rates are needed to give us the best combination of growth and low inflation. The interest rates we currently see are in some cases historically low. Take mortgage rates, for example; they are about 6\1/4\ percent right now which is relatively low historically. It is not really a question of comparing it to rates at another period of time, but rather asking, given those rates, what will be the level of activity in the economy? Will we be on a path that is strong and sustainable going forward? So we will try to do our very best to get the best outcome we can for the American people.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Do you not think with the past history of the Fed and looking at interest rates, when we get them too high, the economy kind of does a little swan song and turns over for awhile and we have some kind of a recession? I am talking on Fed funds. Do you see that happening in the future or do you see that you would anticipate that before it happened?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, there are two possible mistakes. One is to go on too long and one is not to go on long enough, and it is a very difficult balancing act, and as I said earlier, we do not have any kind of mechanical rule. We do not have built in any kind of set of future moves. As we go along, we are going to be looking carefully at all the data, trying to make our best assessment where the economy is, where it is going, and respond to that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Last question. Is there a lot of discussion at the FOMC meeting on this very topic when you meet? In other words, it is not that the Chairman leads and everybody follows?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","There is extensive discussion and I look forward to getting a lot of input from my colleagues on the FOMC.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Bayh.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Mr. Chairman, I would like to follow up on my brief comment in the introductory component here about our increasing global interdependence, some advantages, benefits that come from that, also some potential threats to both our economy and our national security, potentially even our sovereignty, and that is what I would like to ask you about. And increasingly, these are not hypothetical risks. Let me start by remembering, it was a year or so ago, maybe a year and a half, there was a rumor going through Seoul, Korea that they were going to begin to diversify out of dollar denominated assets, and for a brief period of time, that sent the U.S. dollar into a free fall. Sometime after that, a matter of months, the Prime Minister of Japan misspoke, and similar phenomenon followed. He said we perhaps will start diversifying out of dollar denominated assets; the dollar headed straight down. Someone from the ministry comes out and says, no, no, the Prime Minister misspoke. My question to you is twofold. Number one, does it trouble you that a mere statement by a foreign leader could have such a profound effect on our Nation's currency? And number two, what if the Chinese were to misspeak? Or even more, what if they were to announce a similar policy? What kind of impact would that have on our currency and should we be concerned about that? Is there not a loss of sovereignty involved in such a situation? So does this bother you that a mere misstatement can impact in our currency in a tangible way? And what about the Chinese and their possible course of action in the future?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, as you know, the Chinese central bank and other Asian central banks do hold large quantities of U.S. dollar assets in the form of foreign exchange reserves. They hold those assets because they are very attractive assets to hold. They are highly liquid, they are very safe, and they are very good assets to hold in that form as reserves. I am not aware of any significant changes in the plans to hold U.S. dollar assets by foreign central banks and my belief is that moderate changes in the holding of dollar assets would not have significant impact on U.S. asset values. You have to remember that whereas Chinese holdings of U.S. dollar reserves of about $800 billion is an enormous number----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Could I interject just for a moment, Mr. Chairman, with my apologies? Boy, when the rumor was going through Seoul and the Japanese Prime Minister misspoke, the markets seemed to disagree with your evaluation and we are more reliant on the Chinese than we are either of them. So I want to--look, I do not expect you in an open forum here to give me--let me just fall back on my first question, and we will kind of save the others for a little bit later. Does it trouble you that a mere statement could have that kind of impact at least in the marketplace?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, I cannot speak to the marketplace, but I think that over a longer period of time, always there is information that comes in that can affect markets. Perceptions can affect markets. Psychology can affect markets. But over a longer period of time, the holdings of U.S. dollar assets by foreigners are only a portion of the very deep, very large markets in U.S. dollar assets, not only in treasuries but also in other high quality assets, such as corporates and the like, and I believe that those markets are sufficiently deep and liquid that they can withstand moderate changes in the holdings of any group, whether it be domestic or foreign.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","I have time for one more question so I will move on. And I hope you are right. But with the kind of imbalances that we are building up, we may be testing the definition of moderate adjustments and that is my concern going forward, that the longer these things accumulate, the greater risk we run that there will be a disorderly rather than an orderly adjustment of some kind and that does put us--last comment I would make is I always hear the argument, well, they have to consider their own financial interests and that is true. But nation states sometimes have interests other than their own pecuniary gain, and I am concerned that we rely upon their financial interests perhaps at our peril because there are other interests that might motivate their actions moving forward. That is my concern as these balances pile up. My final thing is somewhat related. It is the energy front. This is no longer a hypothetical concern. Russia used their gas exports to leverage Ukraine and possibly Western Europe. Iran has now said, well, if you pressure us unduly on our nuclear program, we will just shut off the oil spigot. Does that concern you, and if so, what would the impact be on our economy if the Iranians were to make good on their threat?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Once again, of course, it cuts two ways. It would hurt the Iranians quite a bit to stop exporting their oil. It hurt the Russians quite a bit to stop exporting their natural gas. But I agree in the following general sense, that whereas there are substantial reserves of oil and natural gas in the world, a large share of them are in areas where there is geopolitical uncertainty or geopolitical risk, and that means that is a risk factor for the economy. We do not have a wide range of spare capacity in these energy areas so that a major change in the supply of energy available could make prices move a lot and that could have a major impact on the economy. That is a concern that we are going to have, I think, for a number of years. My view, in the long-run, is that with energy prices at current levels, over a longer period of time, there are going to be substantial new substitutes, alternative sources of energy, as well as new ways of conserving and reducing the use of energy. But over the next few years, our room for error is modest and we do face the risk that energy prices may fluctuate with changes in supply.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bayh","Thank you. My closing comment, Chairman Bernanke, would be, you know, interdependence is one thing, increasing dependency is another, and it raises potential risks that we best think about in advance so that we do not face a potentially difficult situation at some point down the road. That is the underlying theme of my remarks. Thank you very much.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Sarbanes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Actually, I want to pursue a line of questioning that just follows along with what Senator Bayh has been examining in the course of his questioning, which I thought was right on target and, of course, this is an issue--he chairs our Subcommittee in the international arena--and this is an issue on which he has focused and made some very substantial and positive contributions. Chairman Bernanke, you said to Senator Bayh, they like to hold our dollar assets. They are attractive to hold. I am interested whether there is not something more than that here. Now, these dollar assets, at least according to Marty Feldstein, are being purchased by foreign governments primarily, not by foreign individuals. Feldstein writing in the Financial Times on January 10 said: My own belief, based on widespread conversations with officials and with private bankers, is that the inflow of capital that now finances the U.S. current account deficit is coming primarily, perhaps overwhelmingly, from governments and from institutions acting on behalf of those governments. Do you agree with that statement? Is that your perception as well?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We do not have complete information on these numbers, as you know, Senator, but I do not agree with the thrust of the statement. I think that there are substantial private sector inflows that play a big role in the financing of the U.S. current account deficit.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","If Feldstein were right, that the holders or that this inflow is primarily from foreign governments, would that raise your concern, or do you have any concern about the current account deficit? Let me start there first. I mean it is now at, well, the trade deficit is at $725 billion last year. That is the largest figure we have ever had for a trade deficit. Is that a matter of concern for you?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, Senator, it is.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Okay. All right. Now, if Feldstein is right, that it is foreign governments that are putting in the capital, would that cause you added concern?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I do not think he is correct, Senator. There is something on the order----","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","No, I understand that, and that would require presumably some factual examination, but if he were right, would that heighten your concern?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","It depends really on which type of investor is more sensitive to changes in yields. Central banks have actually been less sensitive to changes in yields than private sector investors. So, I cannot say a priori which situation would be one of more concern. I think it is really not so much the portfolio situation; it is the fact that we are accumulating foreign debt over time, year by year. We can do that because foreigners are willing to finance that debt, but I do not think that we can continue to finance the current account deficit at 6 or 7 percent of GDP indefinitely, and it is desirable for us to bring down that ratio over a period of time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Now it is your view, I take it, that they are doing this because these are attractive investments; is that right?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Attractive in not only the return sense but also in the sense that they are safe, liquid, and easily negotiated.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Well, now if the governments are doing it, would it not have an added significance in terms of trying to gain a trade advantage? Now this is the change in foreign currencies versus the dollar, the appreciation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","This line is the euro, which generally is seen as free floating, responding in a market forces and so forth, the euro-dollar relationship. And this line down here is the Chinese currency, the yuan, right down here. Now that is a pretty dramatic contrast. And China, which of course is holding more and more of our Government debt, actually our trade deficit with China last year was a record in terms of the trade deficit ever recorded with a single country; is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I believe so.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Over $200 billion. Does this not enable them to gain an unfair trade advantage?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, if you are asking me whether I would support or advocate that the Chinese go to greater flexibility in their exchange rate, I certainly would.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Yes.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I think it is, in fact, in their own long-term interest to do so for a number of reasons. It will give them more monetary policy independence. It will reduce the overdependence of their economy on exports and I think it will be commensurate with their increasing global role for them to take an interest in the overall stability of global financial markets and trade.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","But if they can do this on the currency relationship, does it not give them a step up in the trade relationship?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","To the extent that their currency is undervalued, it does, yes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Yes. In fact, we are becoming more and more dependent. Tennessee Williams has that wonderful line in ``A Streetcar Named Desire'' where Blanche DeBois says dependent upon the kindness of strangers, and there are some who look at the American economy and are increasingly concerned that that is what is happening. I quoted Warren Buffett earlier in my opening statement saying right now the rest of the world owns $3 trillion more of us than we own of them. In my view, it will create political turmoil at some point. Pretty soon, I think there will be a big adjustment. Aren't the Chinese accumulating a leverage over our decisionmaking as a consequence of increasing so substantially these holdings of our Government debt?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","First, Senator, I think the $3 trillion should be put in some context. If I recollect, there is something like $15 trillion gross holdings of U.S. assets from foreigners and U.S. holders own about $12 trillion foreign assets, so that is a net number, part of a much bigger flow of in and out of capital.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","But that is a big change from what it used to be----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We have much more open capital markets.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","--not so long ago; is it not?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, we have much more open capital markets, much greater capital flows, and it is worth noting that U.S. national wealth as of the third quarter was $51 trillion to compare that to the $3 trillion. Now, as I said, I think that we should work to reduce the current account deficit over time. I think that would reduce the possibility of an uncomfortable adjustment process. But, again, as I said earlier in response to Senator Bayh, I do not think that the Chinese ownership of U.S. assets is so large as to put our country at risk economically.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","You do not think they could use it for political purposes?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","It would be very much against their own interest to do so.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Well, it would be against their economic interest. It might not be against their political interests in the particular context of what the issue might be. I mean we are struck by the fact--Senator Bayh, I think, made reference to it--a South Korean Government official, and of course their holdings are much less, but still substantial, made a comment about South Korea continuing to hold the dollar, maybe that they would not do it and so forth, and it sent the stock market down over 150 points. Of course, then everyone scrambled and he pulled the statement back and so forth. But if it can have that kind of impact, is it not suggestive of the leverage that the Chinese may have in this situation, or others as well for that matter, but I mean since the deficit with China was at a record last year, I am focusing on them?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Again, information, psychology, and news can always affect markets in the short-term, but I think that over a longer period of time that the depth and liquidity of U.S. financial markets would be sufficient to sustain changes in holdings by foreign central banks.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Mr. Chairman, I see my time is up. I just want to, in closing----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Take another minute.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","--when we talk about the deterioration and the net international investment position, when you talk about so much, this is the chart which illustrates what has happened.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","The first line back there is 1980. We had a positive net position. We then went into a negative position, but look at what has happened to it in recent years. I mean if you regard a minus or a negative position as something to worry about, it seems to me we have very good reason to be worried about what has happened to our net international investment position. It is no wonder Buffett is saying this or Volcker says, ``Under the placid surface there are disturbing trends, huge imbalances, disequilibria, risk, call them what you will. All together the circumstances seem to me as dangerous and intractable as any I can remember, and I can remember quite a lot.'' Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Thank you, Senator Sarbanes. I want to shift to Basel II capital requirements, Mr. Chairman. The Federal Reserve is presently in the process of implementing the Basel II Capital Accord, which will establish new capital requirements for our largest banks. Capital requirements play a vital role in protecting the safety and soundness of the U.S. banking system. I think it is very important that there be no surprises to this Committee and others in the implementation of Basel II, especially unanticipated reductions in capital requirements. Last year, Chairman Bernanke, this Committee held a hearing at which several witnesses here expressed concerns that the adoption of Basel II would result in the lowering of capital requirements. In addition, last year, the Fourth Quantitative Impact Study, unexpectedly, Mr. Chairman, showed that Basel II would result in substantially lower capital requirements which gives then this Committee concern. What steps, Mr. Chairman, need to be taken to make sure that Federal banking regulators, and you are one of these regulators, Congress and the public at large are confident that the implementation of Basel II will not, will not adversely impact the safety and the soundness of the banking system that we know today?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, let me just assure you that the Federal Reserve does not want to see a significant reduction in capital in the U.S. banking system. We are prudential supervisors. We have a very strong interest in maintaining a safe and sound banking system and a stable financial system. We are planning a very slow phase-in process, one that will involve considerable consultation, will involve a variety of safeguards such as floors that will be phased out over a period of time. Moreover, there are a number of other safeguards such as the leverage ratio and Pillar II which allows the supervisors to evaluate the overall safety and soundness of the bank and look at such things as compliance risk or interest rate or liquidity risk. We are very much on the same page as you are, Mr. Chairman. We think Basel II is very important because it will allow banks' capital holdings to be sensitive to the risks that they take, and it will be consistent with modern risk management techniques, so we think it is important to move forward with Basel II. But we do not see this, we certainly do not want this, to be a source of a significant reduction in aggregate capital in the U.S. banking system.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Sarbanes wants to be recognized now. Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Mr. Chairman, I just want to observe that is kind of calming the waters in terms of assurance. Vice Chairman Ferguson did that when this Basel II was under his jurisdiction. Mrs. Bies has it now, I think, in her portfolio. And he told us that they were not going to lower capital and so forth and so on. But you ran the formula in the QIS-4 and it resulted in very substantial capital reductions. Everyone said, the regulators all rushed to say, well, we do not want that; that is not where we want to go. We do not intend to do that if the Congress raises questions about it. But you are moving ahead with a proposed regulation, as I understand it, that is still utilizing the same formula that produced the QIS-4 result, and you are saying, well, if it produces these bad results, we will take all kinds of band-aid measures in order to contain it. But why would you not pull the regulation back, develop a revised formula as part of the proposed regulation, which upon testing did not produce these kind of results about which everyone says, oh, we are very concerned about it, and yet they move ahead with the proposed regulation, still encompassing the formula that everyone admitted created a terrific problem?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, the QIS-4 results were on a best efforts basis. The banks did the best they could with the information they had. They had not yet developed the models. They do not have all the data they need. It was just a very experimental kind of study. In order for this to be really put to the test, the banks need to have the guidance from the regulators about what our expectations are so that they can actually go ahead and develop the models, get the data, and take this to the next level. They really cannot proceed with the process and allow us to do further analysis without some guidance from us. This is very much a dialectical process. We are going to provide guidance, we are going to see the results, we are going to get commentary, and we are going to work together with the banks to make sure that the bank capital is adequate.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","I understand all that, but why are you moving ahead with a formula that has been shown to be faulty? Why do you not pull back and develop a different formula?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We are adjusting the formulas based on what we have learned and we will continue to do so.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","What is going to happen, and I just sound a warning, is you are going to continue down this path, you are going to become more committed, as it were, to your international partners. You are already very heavily committed, I think overcommitted, because you have moved way ahead there, created a problem, and then one day the Congress is going to say to you wait a minute, this is not the path we want to go on; this path is going to lead to a significant reduction in capital. And somehow or other we are going to put a stop to it. Now that is the potential that I see developing by what I think is a faulty process. I think once you had these bad results from the QIS, you should have pulled back, revised the formula, and gone back into a--so when you moved ahead on the process, you had some confidence it was meeting all of these concerns. You are moving ahead on a process now that still has within it the very seeds from which all this concern flows.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, first, we cannot really evaluate the formulas unless we see the results from the banks' own models and their own analyses. There needs to be a dialogue process going on so that we can continue to learn, and second, it is, after all, a very flexible framework that allows for capital under Pillar II. It allows for multipliers and other changes. I hear you very clearly and I assure you once again that it is not in the Federal Reserve's interest to allow inadequate capital in the banking system because financial stability is one of our primary objectives.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Let me just add. Is it a conflict for the banks, to look to the banks to develop the model since the banks stand to benefit in significant ways if they can lower the capital requirement? It will enhance their competitive position vis-a-vis other banks in the U.S. and it will keep them, or they would argue presumably, in a competitive position vis-a-vis banks in other countries that are moving to Basel II. So you keep telling me, well, we are looking for the banks to give us the models, but don't the banks have a particular vested interest in what they want the models to produce?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, actually we are looking for them to give us statistical indicators of their own loss experience in their past credits. And part of the process will be validation. That is, they have to show us that their numbers were derived from their actual experience over a period that encompasses both strong and weak credit conditions and that they are using those models for their own internal analysis of capital. So there will be a lot of checks and we will continue to work with the banks and with the Congress on this issue.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Mr. Chairman, before I recognize Senator Carper for his first found of questions, I just want to emphasize that Senator Sarbanes and I have talked at length to our counterparts in the House, Democrats and Republicans. They have the same concerns we do. We have all been on this Committee--Senator Sarbanes and I have been on this Committee during the thrift bailout and everything. We believe that capital is very, very important for the safety and soundness of our banking system, period.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","Mr. Chairman, I think I would like to ask you a human question before we get into some of the other things I mentioned earlier. I told you I wanted to talk about our savings rate, our poor savings habits in this country, and I wanted to talk about the interplay between the trade deficit and the budget deficit and potential impact on interest rates. But just really a human question at first. You have been in your new job for how long?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Oh, about 14 days now.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","And we were talking in the anteroom before we came in, and I was asking you how you are doing as a human being. And you mentioned jumping right into these hearings 2 weeks into the job was a challenge, and I can understand that. But where does so far 2 weeks into this job, where does it meet your expectations; maybe where is it a little bit different from the expectations you had for it? I say that recognizing that you are probably uncommonly well prepared for this position.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, it has been very challenging and very interesting, and I do have the benefit of having spent almost 3 years at the Board as a Governor, and that experience has been invaluable in trying to address the wide range of issues the Federal Reserve deals with.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","You will be scheduled to come back before us when? About 6 months or so from now?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","That is correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","And one of the questions--this is telegraphing my pitch--but one of the questions I will ask you then is with 6 months of experience under your belt, how do you see the world or this job, your responsibilities, differently, if at all, then than you do as you assume these responsibilities? Let us talk about savings rates. Just share with us, if you will, your view of the kind of job we are doing as savers in this country, where we might do better, and some things that not just the Federal Reserve but those of us in the Congress should be thinking about to encourage a better savings rate? And why should this or should this not be a concern to us?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, this actually ties back to the questions raised about the current account, for example. The reason we have a current account deficit is that we invest more, including housing, than we save, and we have to make up the difference by borrowing abroad, so our national saving is not sufficient to fund our domestic investment opportunities. It is a good thing in a sense that we are able to go to the international capital markets and find funding for good domestic investment opportunities, but we would be better off in some sense if we ourselves could fund those investment opportunities creating more wealth for Americans and greater capacity in the future for us to deal with the long-term challenges associated with demographic changes and the like. So, I think it is desirable for us to try to raise our national saving. There are various dimensions to that. One is on the fiscal side. We are looking in the next 5, 10, 15 years to increasing obligations and entitlement spending, for example, and increasing challenges in the Government's budget. Congress is going to have to make some very tough decisions about controlling the deficit, and by doing so, to the extent that the deficit can be reduced, that is a direct contribution to national saving and would be constructive. In addition, Americans, in part because of the increased wealth they have gained through increased home values and through other asset price increases, have not saved too much out of current income. In fact, the current saving out of disposable income is a negative rate.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","Say that one more time.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","The savings rate, the ratio of household savings to after-tax income, is currently less than zero. That is, spending is more than income. Our expectation is that that saving rate will increase over time for a number of natural reasons, including the possibility that house prices will no longer rise as quickly as they have and so people will be forced to turn to saving out of current income in order to build their assets. But in addition, it would be desirable for Americans to save more to prepare better for the future. The problem is we do not have really good effective tools to achieve that. There are obviously ways of providing tax incentives or other kinds of tax-favored vehicles to help people save. There is a lot of debate about how effective those actually are and I really cannot give you a strong answer there. One thing which I think can be done and would be positive would be on the financial literacy front. When I was on the school board in New Jersey many years ago, I argued for more economics in the schools. I thought that it was very important for young people to understand early on that they need to put something away; they need to develop a habit of saving, and they need to understand enough about financial markets and financial instruments that they can save effectively. So that is one dimension where I think we can be helpful, but I agree that saving is something that needs to be promoted and that it is good for our long-term future to have greater wealth accumulation.","Speech"," "
"Senator Carper","I would just say, Mr. Chairman, and to my colleagues and to Chairman Bernanke, in our experience in Delaware, trying to get people to save through the State of Delaware's deferred compensation program, State employees, people who were higher income, and there are not very high- income State employees in Delaware, but people whose incomes are higher tend to save a lot. They maxed out in the deferred comp program. But in order to get the people who were at the lower end to save, we had to be able to provide some incentives for them, and to say for every dollar that you save, we will like match it with two dollars, and to get to prime the pump, and once we did, they would participate. And the other thing I would say, for most of us, the biggest source of savings is really the equity in our homes, and to the extent that we can include homeownership opportunities not for people like $150,000 or $200,000, but to the people who are making $25,000, then we do a very good thing for them as they prepare for their golden years. Thank you, sir.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Schumer for your first round.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank you, Chairman Bernanke--that has a nice ring to it. I am glad you are here. I thought your confirmation process was both a tribute to you and a model of how we should do other confirmations, particularly on other Committees on which I might serve or do serve, with a lot of consultation, bipartisanship, et cetera. I have a bunch of questions. The first relate to the overall global situation of the United States and as it relates to China. You said yesterday that we need to increase national savings as one of the ways to deal with our big trade deficit with the rest of the world and China. Yet, the budget we passed 2 weeks ago increased the debt we have further and there is a push to put new tax cuts in that. Now, I am not asking you to opine on tax cuts. I know you do not want to do that. I do want to ask you does it make sense, from a global perspective, for us to continue to increase this deficit, whether it is by tax cuts or increased savings? Does that not weaken the position of the United States in trying to accomplish many of our other international economic goals?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","As I indicated to Senator Carper, I think reducing the fiscal deficit is an important priority. It is important because looking forward 10, 15, 20 years, we have a demographic challenge coming, and we need to be prepared for that, and it does contribute to national savings which enhances our wealth creation and the strength of our economy in the future. So, I do think that we should look at that. There really are two separate questions. I just would note the first one is the size of the Government itself. I mean what we should agree on how big the Federal Government, that is the Federal budget, should be, and then we need to make sure that the revenues we collect are commensurate with those expenditures over a period of time.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","You do agree that, again, now looking more at the type of actions that Senator Graham and I have been active in, not commenting on our methodology, that it would be better for the world economy and for the United States if China were after some point of time to allow its currency to float, which would adjust for trade imbalances that would occur. Do you agree with that?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, Senator, I do. I think China should move toward a more flexible exchange rate.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","And why do you think we are making so little progress with China right now?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","That is a good question. They have, I think, mixed views about the benefits to their own economy of making that change.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Right.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","They see some benefits in what they view as stability. They see an advantage in exports from keeping their exchange rate where it is. But as I was suggesting, I think, to Senator Sarbanes, it is very much in their interest to move toward a more flexible exchange rate to increase their monetary independence, to reduce their reliance on exports, and just to continue to play an appropriate role in contributing to global financial and trade stability.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Right. And I agree with the thrust of your comments there. The Chinese seem to want a lot of the benefits of being part of the global system, but are much less quick to take their responsibilities. What would you suggest to people like Senator Graham and I? Now make no mistake about it, our legislation is very popular in Congress, but lots of economists and people I respect say you are right on your goals and you are right that China is not moving quickly enough, but this is the wrong way to go. The problem is we are ready to tear our hair out. There seems to be no other way to go. The Administration has tried talking softly and talking loudly. It just seems nothing gets them to move. Do you have any suggestions on how we can get the Chinese to let the currency float? No one is saying it has to float freely, completely, immediately. There have to be adjustments. But what can we do other than the legislation that Senator Graham and I have introduced? We do not see any other solution at this point. The Chinese say to us if you put pressure on us, we will not move, and then when we do not put pressure on them, they do not move.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I appreciate your frustration, Senator Schumer. As you probably know, I think it is not a good idea to break down some of the gains we have made in terms of free and open trade in the world economy. We should be very careful about that. But in terms of working with China, there are really two things we can do. We can continue to try to be persuasive and we can try to offer technical assistance in helping them. They have taken some steps in terms of increasing their trading platforms and their capacity to allow the exchange rate to float. I agree they need to do more and we just need to continue to work with them and be as persuasive as possible.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","One final question on this, if I might,","Speech"," "
"Mr. Chairman","","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Go ahead.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Doesn't the fact that China and other countries, Japan, have such large amounts of American reserves mean that they could, if they wanted, actually have a little bit of your job, have some effect over interest rates in the United States by what they do?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","As I indicated already this morning, I think that the capital markets for U.S. dollar assets are sufficiently large, deep, and liquid that the impact of such changes would be mostly transitory and could be managed.","Speech"," "
"Senator Schumer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Bunning.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are on 5 minute round of questions, are we not?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Or as much time as you need.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you. Just to follow up on Senator Schumer's discussion about China. We took six Senators to China to talk trade with the Chinese. They would not even visit with us. Six U.S. Senators, five were on the Trade Subcommittee of the Finance Committee, and we got number six in line in the Chinese bureaucracy and he knew nothing about trade. So, I just want you to know what a problem there is, and we worked like the devil to get them into the WTO, and I wish that they would just follow the rules of WTO. That is an aside. Yesterday, you talked a lot about our budget deficits and particularly our long-term obligations that are only going to increase. You also rightly said those decisions are ones that Congress needs to make. How much of a factor are those long- term entitlements in your economic forecast? I am speaking about Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security. It looks like by the year 2030 that they will take up about 70 to 75 percent of our budget. So we will be squeezed down to about 25 percent for discretionary spending. So how much do they come into your forecast?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, your basic facts are absolutely right. The numbers I have are that in the next 40 years the share of GDP being devoted to Social Security, Medicare, and the Federal part of Medicaid is going to go from about 8 percent today to about 16 percent 40 years from now. Since the historical share of GDP collected as tax revenues is something in the order of 18.2 percent, that suggests there will be very little room in the budget for anything other than entitlement spending and suggests it is very important for Congress to begin thinking about how it wants to reorder or set its priorities. It is important to get that going soon, first of all, to assure financial markets that Congress will be responsible and, second, and perhaps even more importantly, to give people the time they need to plan for retirement and make provision based on any changes that Congress might decide to make. In terms of our forecast, as I reported today, are usually only a year or two in the future, uncertainty being what it is. So only the near-term effects are reflected in our forecasts. We are already beginning to see some effects of entitlement spending on the budget deficit. We factor that in, but since we are only looking at the near-term effects, we obviously are not incorporating these very large, long-term entitlement obligations into the near-term forecasting exercise.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","If nothing is done to shore up these programs, and I am speaking about entitlements, for several more years, what kind of impact is this going to have on our economic growth and employment and how will that affect your ability to act?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Well, the widening deficits over a period of years will reduce national savings, will probably exacerbate the current account deficit, may raise interest rates, and will probably inhibit the dynamism of the economy. I do not foresee, in the near-term, that these factors are going to substantially affect monetary policy or the way monetary policy functions in the economy, but from a broader perspective, the health of our economy, in the long-run, requires that we achieve a better fiscal situation and higher national saving.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","In reference to the trade deficit, how long do we have to reduce trade imbalances before our economy starts to suffer because of them?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, it is very hard to judge. It took us about 10 years to get where we are today from about 1995 when the current account deficit began to open up. It might take that long to reverse. It might take a number of years to reverse, and I think that it is certainly possible to have a decline in the current account taking place over a number of years, but it is very hard to judge exactly how long the process is going to take.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bunning","Thank you, Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Mr. Chairman, the January survey of senior loan officers indicated that 40 percent of respondents felt that the outlook for delinquencies and chargeoffs of nontraditional mortgages was likely to deteriorate somewhat. Would this type of credit quality deterioration be consistent with the forecast that you outlined for a soft landing in housing markets? And do you believe that bank regulators including the Fed, yourself, acted quickly enough in putting out supervisory guidance regarding these types of nontraditional mortgage products?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I cannot really speak to the timing. We have put out----","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","First of all, I realize you have just gone to the Fed.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We have put out guidance for comment on nontraditional mortgages and I think that it is good guidance. It addresses what I think are the main issues. First, are banks underwriting nontraditional mortgages in an appropriate way? In particular, are they selling these mortgages to people who are able to manage them effectively?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Will you as a regulator at the Federal Reserve require banks to take any additional steps to mitigate the risk and how might these steps affect the economy if you see it is necessary?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, as I was saying, the guidance includes several components, including both underwriting and consumer disclosure to protect consumers, but also safety and soundness. The banks should manage the risks associated with nontraditional mortgages in a way that maintains their capital at a safe and sound level.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Your report this morning, Chairman Bernanke, indicates that growth in labor productivity over the past 5 years has averaged over 3 percent per year. For the fourth quarter of 2005, it declined 0.2 percent in the business sector and 0.6 percent in the nonfarm business sector. The productivity declines were unexpected by most market watchers. What is your assessment of these numbers? Do they represent a one time aberration or are they indicative of things to come? Do you believe it is possible for us to sustain the pace that we have seen over the past 5 years?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Mr. Chairman, the fourth quarter appears to have been a transitory decline in growth related to a number of special factors, including effects of the hurricanes, the seasonal pattern of sales of automobiles, and some other factors as well. So with output down more than the underlying trend would indicate, productivity, which of course is output per worker, also declined in the fourth quarter.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Think that will continue?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","It appears that the first quarter will see significant rebound from the fourth quarter and likely productivity will come back with it. We, in the Federal Reserve, pay most attention to productivity growth over the longer-term, and the ability of the U.S. economy to generate ongoing productivity gains through use of technology, through the flexibility of our labor and capital markets has been most impressive. And we expect good productivity gains to continue for the next few years.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Thank you. Senator Bennett for your first round.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I apologize for coming in late. I have been over in the House side chairing the meeting of the Joint Economic Committee to hear the President's Annual Economic Report from the Council of Economic Advisors, and they miss you, Mr. Chairman, but they acquitted themselves extremely well, and your former colleagues did a great job. Let me focus on an area where you had questioning on the House side where some of your comments were, shall I say, not the ones that I would have wanted. I want to talk to you about ILC's. I am sure that comes as no surprise to you. Being the Senator from Utah, I represent the State where the ILC's are a very significant industry. I have not had a chance to review the transcript directly. I have been told by one of the Members of the House who was there that you were told that some ILC's have failed, and that is not true.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I was not told that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Okay. I want to get the record straight on that. The ILC's are back in the news right now because of Wal- mart's application, and people are saying, well, we have to prevent Wal-mart from getting an ILC charter. That is just awful. No one wanted to prevent Target from getting an ILC charter, and I have a hard time understanding why it is okay for one large retailer to have such a charter and not for its competitor to have such a charter. I have talked with the Wal-mart executives. I believe they are sincere in their statement that they do not intend to go into the banking business. Indeed, they are signing long-term leasing contracts with community banks, community banks entering Wal-mart with their own branches. The Wal-mart people told me we have looked at this, but we are not bankers, we are retailers, they are different businesses, and we do not want to go into a business we do not understand. However, simply getting an ILC charter will save Wal-mart $30 million a year in processing fees to a bank. If they are technically a bank, they do not have to pay another bank to process all the charges, all the credit card charges, all the checks, and money orders, et cetera, that they process. They will process them themselves through their ILC. It is worth $30 million a year to them. I do not see anything wrong with that, and I hope the FDIC does not see anything wrong with that. They are the regulator of the ILC's. For years, the staff at the Federal Reserve has felt strongly that the FDIC is not capable of regulating the ILC's and they either want them destroyed or short of that, they want them transferred to the Fed, so that the Fed oversees them. I see no market reasons why that is necessary, no circumstances in the real world that says the Fed could do a better job than the FDIC. So, I would like your responses to that and your comments about the ILC's, your attitude as to how dangerous they may be, and any data that you might have to back that up, and then your sense of what would happen to the ILC's if indeed the Fed were to succeed in its crusade to get the regulatory responsibility shifted away from the FDIC?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, first of all, as you point out, the specific case at hand, the Wal-mart case is the FDIC's decision. I understand they are going to have a public hearing and will evaluate the merits of that individual case. The concerns that the Federal Reserve have had about ILC's have turned largely on recent proposals that ILC's would have additional powers including interest on business checking and out-of-State branching which would de facto make ILC's the functional equivalent of banks. And our concern has been that if ILC's are to be the functional equivalents of banks, that they receive parallel treatment in terms of consolidated supervision and other responsibility requirements that banks face. And it may be that I have only been in the job 2 weeks, but I am not aware that the Fed has lobbied to become the regulator of the ILC's.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","I think the staff will make you aware of that fairly soon.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Perhaps they will. The main thing is that Congress should try to be consistent, make sure that rules that they apply are applied consistently across similar types of organizations, and that is the concern that we have had, and we have been concerned about the ownership of ILC's by nonfinancial institutions and whether or not that poses risks to the safety net or creates an unlevel playing field with other kinds of financial institutions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","I think those are legitimate questions, and I believe the ILC's qualify for their present circumstance in the face of all of those questions. In 1997, Chairman Greenspan said, quote: The case is weak in our judgment for umbrella supervision of a holding company in which the bank is not the dominant unit and is not large enough to induce systemic risk should it fail. And that, of course, is the case with the ILC's. If Wal- mart were to get its charter, the bank would clearly not be the dominant unit. And its size would not indicate systemic risk. Taking that statement from your predecessor, do you have any ideas about how it no longer applies or any reaction or, again, is this issue, and I am not saying this to put you down in any sense, I think it is very possible that this issue is simply too new for you to feel comfortable commenting on it, and I would not complain if you said that was the case. But we do have this comment by Chairman Greenspan, which he has subsequently recanted, but which we really like. And I would like your reaction to it.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Again, I think that it would probably not be appropriate for me to comment on the Wal-mart case given its status of being adjudicated by the FDIC.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Just comment about this whole idea generally because this statement was made before Wal-mart applied for their charter.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","The general concern is that if a commercial firm owns a bank, would there not be a possibility that the safety net would be inadvertently extended to the commercial firm? Would we be able to segregate the financial condition of the commercial firm from the bank and would it be possible for not just the FDIC but for any bank supervisor to adequately supervise not only the bank but also the owning firm to ensure that the safety and soundness rules were being met?","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Now we are edging into Gramm-Leach-Bliley and the conversation about banking and commerce. I used Wal- mart as the example because they put a specific number on it. Simply having an ILC charter is worth $30 million to them a year if they do absolutely nothing as far as the consumer is concerned and it does not change the safety and soundness of anything to me. Many of the largest ILC's in Utah are owned by automobile companies. GMAC, Volkswagen, Mercedes, they do very large financing operations, and they find that having an ILC charter is enormously valuable to them even if they do not issue checkbooks and they do not open branches, and they do not do the traditional kinds of things that banks do. This is a device, created by the Congress, that is helping the marketplace, making things more efficient, saving money all the way around, which presumably means that consumers benefit because there is less money going into it. We do not have to continue this, but I just want to lay this issue on the table before you because I think you will see down at the Fed that there is an effort on the part of some members of the staff to, if not curtail the ILC's all together, to bring them under Fed jurisdiction, and that is certainly former Chairman Leach's desire. He is not fond of ILC's and I think would like to see them eliminated, and I am laying down again the marker, I am very fond of them, and I want to see them continued.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Senator, the thrust of the Leach bill would be essentially to restrict the kind of firm that could own an ILC and that was the part that I commented on favorably yesterday. Again, the Federal Reserve is not in itself looking to find new areas, new domains, but having a financial holding company or a financial company owning the ILC mitigates some of the concerns that I have talked about relating to consolidated supervision.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Thank you. I am sure we will be having more conversations about this. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Senator Sarbanes, you have any other questions?","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Senator Bennett having laid the issue on the table, I think I should continue with it for a bit just to be clear. As I understand it, the FDIC does not have consolidated supervisory authority and that is the problem with these ILC's, unlike the role the Fed has with respect to regular financial institutions under the Federal Bank Holding Company Act; is that correct?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","That is correct.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","And, of course, Chairman Greenspan was quite outspoken about this issue. I do not know. You cited him for something, but it is----","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","I acknowledge he has changed his mind since he said that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","He has been quite strong about it. In fact, he expressed a concern that the ILC's, which are chartered in just a handful of States, represented a breach in the traditional separation of banking and commerce in the United States, and unlike the financial institutions with banking subsidiaries, the owners of the ILC's are not currently subject to the supervisory requirements of the Bank Holding Company Act. So you have a very significant loophole here. I mean these ILC--I understand Senator Bennett's interest in this matter-- but, you know, they have grown at an incredible rate. The aggregate amount of assets controlled by Utah-chartered ILC's is 16 times the total of all the banks, savings associations, and credit unions chartered in Utah.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","We are very grateful.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","It has become a huge business there. One ILC has more than $58 billion in assets. I do not think Target should have a bank. I mean you said no one questions that. I question that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","Okay.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","In Gramm-Leach-Bliley, we closed the unitary thrift loophole as a way to further the separation of banking and commerce, and this one loophole remained and is now being exploited and expanded to the hilt, and I think it is a very serious problem. Now, the Leach legislation, as I understand it, would simply subject the ILC's to the same prudential constraints including consolidated supervisory requirements, bank level capital, managerial criteria, enforcement mechanisms, as applied to financial holding companies. And the GAO was asked to do a study and they concluded that the ILC's were not adequately regulated under current law. The problem may come somewhere down the line, just like it did with the savings and loans. I mean we had the savings and loans people came in and said, well, we need to accommodate here, it is an important part of our economy. And 50 percent of the savings and loans that failed were in the State of Texas. So we had Members of the Committee who were deeply interested in that and so we went along, went along, and whammo. I think the taxpayers paid $132 billion for the savings and loans. So, I am concerned about these loopholes and the exploitation of these loopholes because there is not around them the kind of regulatory examination, the regulatory framework, which helped to assure the safety and soundness of the system. So the matter having been put on the table, I thought I should contribute to the discussion.","Speech"," "
"Senator Bennett","I am always grateful for your contribution.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","I want to very quickly, Mr. Chairman, ask you two or three quick questions, just as kind of an alert of our interest. One is the remittances, an issue that you have taken an interest in. I want to underscore that. Is there a greater role for the Fed to play in expanding the service of its international automated clearinghouse? There is some opinion that think that. I mean you have just reached an understanding with the Mexican central bank and it is felt that that is going to make a difference. What about expanding it?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","It is correct that we have reached an agreement with Mexico, and to the best of my knowledge we are exploring further opportunities and we are open to your comments or suggestions.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Okay. Everyone thinks of you as primarily a monetary policy, and that is understandable, but the Fed has a very significant role, of course, as a bank regulator. Privacy and data security, something the Chairman has focused a great deal of attention on. Last year, we had these incredible instances of several financial institutions--actually Government agencies, private companies as well--reporting these breaches of Social Security numbers, credit and debit card numbers, security codes, and bank account information. What can the Fed do to help tighten up data privacy and security and enhancing the privacy rights of consumers?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","The Federal Reserve together with the other banking regulators already has issued, I believe, its regulations to the banking system concerning management of data. There are really two parts to it. First, that banks are required to have good internal controls, to make sure the data are protected. And second, that banks are required, and other financial institutions are required, to inform customers if there is a data breach that has caused, or is likely to cause, or be a source of fraud. So we have created a structure in the banking system to address these issues, and to my knowledge, I believe that Congress is looking to some extent at our approach as a model for thinking about extending these rules to other kinds of organizations.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","And finally this Committee has held a number of hearings on money laundering and terrorism financing. Actually, you know, the Department of Justice has undertaken criminal investigations of bank officials in these areas. But that suggests that the regulatory authorities, the bank regulatory authorities of whom the Fed is one, somehow fell behind the curve, so to speak. What can be done to boost that oversight with respect to money laundering and terrorism financing?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","We consider it a very important issue, and we are putting a lot of resources into it. Our approach is again to assess information management systems that banks have to make sure that they know their customer or they know the source of a transaction. That is the best way we have to approach this and again we will continue to work hard to make sure that the Anti-Money Laundering and Bank Secrecy Act rules are obeyed.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Is there a special unit at the Fed that focuses on this?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","I think it is part of the general Bank Supervision Division, but there are certainly quite a number of individuals who are specially involved in it, who have special backgrounds.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Do you think it has a high enough profile within the Fed organization or the Fed hierarchy?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Would you allow me more time to learn more about the structure of the organization?","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Fine. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I do want to commend the Fed on the work it is doing in the area of financial literacy and in particular Chairman Bernanke's commitment to that effort. He made reference to when he was on the school board. It was an elected school board, as I recall; correct?","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Yes, sir. I received over 1,000 votes.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","We are always impressed by that.","Speech"," "
"Senator Sarbanes","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Shelby","Chairman Bernanke, we look forward to working with you in many areas, and we know you will be back before the Committee. We wish you the best as you undertake your new opportunities and responsibilities. The hearing is adjourned.","Speech"," "
"Chairman Bernanke","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.","Speech"," "
