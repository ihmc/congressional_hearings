"Mr. Issa","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate your indulgence in this. I know we are all on kind of a crazy schedule here in this extended, extended, extended Congress. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus--if he was here--and members of the committee, I want to thank you for this opportunity to speak today. There is no more important issue before Congress now than ending the financial crisis that besets our country, whether it is in fact the financial crisis that we believed we were dealing with only weeks ago or it is the auto companies that were before you this week. As you know, I have been a critic of the bailout from its inception. I have stressed deliberate action and warned of potential failures. I think I have been vindicated in my objection to that spending of $700 billion of taxpayers' dollars, of which half already appears to have been spent. I am not pleased with that. I wish I had been wrong. After all, these are not private funds that companies can use freely. These are, in fact, the future tax dollars of Americans, and our children will be paying not just the principal but the interest for generations to come. To date, the oversight of the bailout has been severely lacking. Through no fault of the Congress, we were pushed to quickly pass a bill that only generally called for accounting. The Government Accountability Office--as we will hear more about today--the Washington Post and other media outlets, and most importantly, the American people have been critical of the lack of oversight and the inability to apply oversight. People want to know where their money is being spent and if it is having the impact that is intended, and few think that it is. While we know there are many bad actors and causes of financial crisis from lack of lending practices to insufficient regulatory scrutiny, substantial questions regarding the root causes still remain. Yesterday, in our Committee on Government Reform we dealt with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae, and we came away with more unanswered questions than answered questions. Neither Congress nor officials within the Administration have sufficient expertise to gain a full understanding of the complex issues surrounding both how we got in and how we will get out of this. A Colombia University professor recently stated that any reform must begin with a dispassionate and informed assessment of what went wrong. And I agree. We must pass legislation to create a bipartisan or nonpartisan blue-ribbon panel that can give the American people an objective assessment of the causes and the handling of the financial crisis. Although no one bill would be perfect, and certainly mine is no different, in November, I introduced H.R. 7275, the Financial Oversight Commission Act of 2008. Modeled after the 9/11 Commission, the Financial Oversight Commission is designed to have experts examine the causes of this crisis, evaluate corrective measures taken thus far, and make recommendations for alternative measures. The commission should examine the missteps of we as Congress, the Administration, the private sector, nonprofit organizations, certainly the GSEs and all others have taken, and then make recommendations on the next step forward. Had we done this in the original legislation, we would already be halfway through the commission process. The commission could take up to a year to conduct its entire investigations, make findings, and report the recommendations to Congress and the President. However, as I am sure the Chair would agree, commissions in the first 90 days often accomplish a great deal of what they will accomplish in 1 year by bringing the type of focus and the type of individuals and the type of scrutiny that causes others to begin to volunteer changes. As economic conditions in the financial sector itself are not static, the panel will continue its review and would evaluate ongoing circumstances. In a report to Congress, the commission shall make a complete accounting of the circumstances surrounding the crisis, the private sector, the government role in causing the crisis, and the extent to which the United States preparedness for immediate response to a future crisis. The report should offer a conclusion and recommendations for corrective measures that can be taken to prevent further economic breakdown. Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus, it is time that we realize that we are a partisan organization; the next President will be a partisan organization; that we had a hand in the creation of this problem, whether it was a large hand or a small hand; whether it was in fact things we told the financial institutions to do or, quite frankly, oversight we failed to assert over them at both the executive and the congressional level. So Mr. Chairman, I strongly recommend that as you deliberate the current, you begin thinking about how we would put together, on a broad basis, a commission that would be a tool of this Congress. I thank you for this opportunity.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE DARRELL E. ISSA, A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

"The Chairman","I am going to try to hold Members as close as possible to 5 minutes. As close as possible means as long as I don't daydream, 5 minutes.",Speech,
"Mr. Pascrell","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee for allowing me to present testimony before this committee. I am here to talk about the need to use TARP funds to open up the credit market for consumers to start purchasing automobiles again. Mr. Chairman, while I was back home in New Jersey this last week, I happened to pass the Port of Newark, and saw an endless stream of brand-new cars, just row upon row, sitting there, seemingly hoping to be moved by fate, if not by sale. I have never seen that many cars piled on top of each other--well, not unless you count D.C. traffic on a Friday afternoon when everyone is trying to get out of town. Mr. Chairman, the fact is that no bridge loan or bailout of the auto industry or any other industry for that matter, no matter how well-structured or planned, will work unless credit is available to consumers to make these purchases. And purchasing power and credit is down 99 percent from last year. The reason why I voted, and I believe so many Members of Congress voted, to approve the $700 billion in October was so that the Treasury could open up the frozen credit market. This was supposed to help keep people in their homes, and make it possible for the American people to make large purchases, like automobiles, that could boost our ailing economy. Sadly, that does not seem to be occurring. The economic health of our Nation depends on a robust automotive industry. Nearly 1 in 10 Americans rely on the automotive industry for their livelihood and their financial security. Auto sales constitute 20 percent of all retail spending in the United States and generate up to 20 percent of the sales tax revenue for State and local governments. We know how hard-pressed they are today. We have heard a lot of talk in the past few weeks about the bridge loan being a bailout for the Big Three or an economic stimulus intended just for Detroit. But I don't think one Main Street in America, I can't think of one that isn't affected when a local new-car dealer closes shop, takes good jobs and economic opportunity with them. When a new-car dealer goes out of business, they not only take away jobs and money, but they also become a blight upon the landscape, a visual reminder of the failures in our economy. Nearly 700 mostly family-owned new-car retail businesses have closed in the past 11 months. That equates to some 20,000 newly unemployed Americans, just in time for this holiday season. The automobile retail industry is highly credit- dependent and has been hit especially hard by the recent financial crisis in flagging consumer confidence. Although it is an opportune time to buy a new car, thanks to many industry deals and great incentives, the public cannot get the financing they need to bring that new car home. People who have the good credit necessary to get car loans can no longer gain approval for their purchases. In fact, for 2008, only an estimated 13.5 million new vehicles were likely to be sold, down from 16.1 million in 2007, which is a 15-year low. The truth is that this crisis in the automobile industry goes far beyond the Big Three. Sales at Toyota and Honda are down more than 30 percent from last year, and are down more than 40 percent, roughly in line with the loss of sales for American automakers. We need to stop making this an issue of blame and find the constructive solutions necessary to get the economy moving. It was my understanding, and I thought it was your understanding, Mr. Chairman, that the TARP was supposed to be one of the main solutions, but so far that has not come to fruition for the average American. TARP funds have been greatly mismanaged to date and they have not been used to help consumers purchase the goods that they need. I believe that the TARP funds should go directly into helping consumers gain access to these loans which would provide a direct stimulus to the economy. Credit is essential in our economy. If loans don't get made, businesses don't expand, orders don't get placed, and workers don't get hired. As banks have restricted access to mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards, consumers have had to alter their spending behavior so rapidly that companies cannot adjust fast enough. The Treasury should use TARP funds to open a credit market for auto loans because, as I stated before, no amount of loans or bailout will work in the short or long term unless consumers are able to buy the cars in the first place. Mr. Chairman, I would like to mention that I also believe we urgently need to consider new tax incentives for consumers. I would in closing say, as you know, I introduced the bill, we talked about it in the last meeting, the Auto Insurance Tax Assistance bill. I call on you, Mr. Chairman, and Mr. Ranking Member, to do something about the TARP funds to get this economy moving. And automobiles have a lot to do with it. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE BILL PASCRELL, JR., A REPRESENTATIVE IN CONGRESS FROM THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY
"The Chairman","I thank both Members. I will now begin our opening statements. I will of course begin by--we had to sit through yours, but you don't have to sit through ours. The gentleman from New Jersey well understands, as a member of the Ways and Means Committee, the last item he mentioned is not within the jurisdiction of this committee, but of the Ways and Means Committee. While we are on the subject of jurisdiction, I want to be sure the new ranking member of the Oversight Committee, who apparently yesterday expressed some concern that we would screw his committee out of doing their job, nothing could be further from the truth. That was what was reported. The AP said they heard that.",Speech,
"Mr. Issa","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will be glad to talk to you anytime. We don't have to use the AP.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Excuse me. I haven't yielded. We have rules here. I was responding to an AP comment. The gentleman said we could talk at any time. I don't remember hearing from him. I read it in the AP. I want to just respond here in this way: Some of my Republican colleagues appear to believe that the world was created in January of 2007 when we became the Majority. I will tell you this: The relationship between this committee and what was then the Committee on Government Reform did not change in 2007. The notion that somehow there was some machination on the part of myself or others to diminish the role of that committee is: (a) wrong; and (b) completely ignores the history. There was literally no change in that relationship between the chairmanship of Mr. Oxley. So this notion that somehow in January of 2007 we began some change is wrong. Secondly, I will say that I have at no point ever asked any member of that committee not to do anything. I worked with Mr. Kucinich, who is the chair of the appropriate subcommittee. At one of our most recent hearings, I read into the record a letter that he had done. I encouraged Mr. Waxman to go forward. So if there was not oversight to the gentleman's satisfaction, that was entirely the result of decisions made within that committee. During the 12 years of Republicans being in the Majority, and during the last couple of years, it did seem to me they began to do some things. So I did want to allay the gentleman's fears.",Speech,
"Mr. Issa","If the chairman would yield?",Speech,
"The Chairman","I listened to the gentleman's statement, and read what he said in the paper.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","May I ask the chairman, what is the order here?",Speech,
"The Chairman","I am making my opening statement.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","This is your opening statement. Okay.",Speech,
"The Chairman","It is not my closing statement. I said we were through with them and we would now go to opening statements. I said they didn't have to listen to ours. I would have preferred an opening statement that was more relevant to this hearing, but when things are said inaccurately, and reported in the newspaper, and they cause some concern, I like to calm people down. I have people worried that this committee is plotting to take away their jurisdiction. I don't want to ruin anybody's Christmas by thinking I am going to Grinch-like take away the jurisdiction of another committee. I yield to the gentleman from California.",Speech,
"Mr. Issa","I thank the chairman. As you know, we worked together very well while we were both on Judiciary together. The comments yesterday with an open mike quite candidly, taken properly, would have been a compliment to you and to Mr. Waxman.",Speech,
"The Chairman","I appreciate the compliment. I would say my advice--the gentleman is free to take it or not--is that I would shut off both the compliments and the mike next time. I have to get back to the subject of this hearing, which is the TARP. I am not going to exceed my 5 minutes, and no one else is. I did vote for this. I continue to think I was right to vote for this. One of the advantages that economists have over people in the public sector is that they can employ something called the counterfactual. They can--and Professor Warren is nodding her head; I appreciate the validation--compare what was happening to what would have happened in the absence of action. That is the counterfactual. I have said before what people say to me, ``Well, what do you think about the way that TARP is working?'' I have invoked before the wisdom of the great 21st Century philosopher, Henny Youngman in his exchange, ``How's your wife?'' ``Compared to what?'' The metric of, ``compared to what'' is a very important one when you are doing this. I do believe that the counterfactual here, namely our failure to have done anything at all late last fall in the face of the credit crisis, would have left us in a worse situation. I would just cite, as I have done before, the treasurer of the State of Massachusetts, who reported he couldn't roll over short-term notes, meaning payroll for the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, paying vendors. Once the bill was passed, he was able to do it. The treasurer of California, Mr. Lockyer, I know has communicated similarly. So the question is not whether we should or shouldn't have done that, in my mind; but having done it, could it have been executed better? I believe it can. I would cite two things as I draw this to a close. In the legislation, indeed essential to the passage of the legislation was the language the gentlewoman from California worked on, among others, to ensure that some of these funds would be used to reduce foreclosures, not solely or even largely as a matter of compassion for individuals, but because in the macroeconomic sense foreclosure reduction is an essential part of the problem of getting us out of the problem we are in. The refusal so far to use the money for that purpose has been, I think, a violation of the intent and undermines the ability to get votes in the Congress to do things in the future. Similarly, I was distressed when we were told we didn't have good oversight. The fact we are in this hearing, responding to a GAO report, shows that we did have good oversight. The GAO was in there from day one. We met with them. They have done a very good job. There is a new board that will also be doing some oversight. The point is that what troubled me was when Treasury was asked by GAO, ``Do you know how much money each bank is lending out, those that have gotten capital infusion?'', they appeared to say, ``We are not going to try to find that out.'' Now, I am hoping and some indications are we are going to get a clarification of that. On those two issues, I was disappointed. The gentleman from Alabama is recognized for how much time?",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","You took 7 minutes. If I could have an equal amount of time.",Speech,
"The Chairman","It is 20 minutes and 20 minutes. I am surprised he is acting as if there are new rules here; it is 20 and 20.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","I will take just take 5 minutes. I am sure I will have other members. First of all, and I didn't realize we were going to depart from the subject matter of the hearing, but I want to compliment you, Ranking Member Issa, for yesterday's hearing. I want to say to Members on both sides and to the general public that what you are hearing revealed yesterday was quite astounding, and that is that we had Fannie and Freddie--if I am characterizing this right, there were multiple warnings; people within those organizations which were warning that what they were doing was dangerous. They were being pushed by mandates, affordable housing mandates and mandates to make loans which should not have been made. I hope this Congress will take a look at the various sometimes congressional-mandated, sometimes administrative- mandated, directives to loan money to people who, quite frankly, did not have the ability to pay them back. No document loans, stated income loans, just a smorgasbord of bad business decisions. And it wasn't as if people in the organizations were not sounding the alarm. I thank you and Scott Garrett on this committee who participated in that. I listened to a great deal of that. People wondered where I was yesterday. I was following that hearing. It was a very important hearing. As we attempt to pick up the pieces with you and not make mistakes of the past, I hope we won't let what went on at Fannie and Freddie go on in the future. So I compliment you, Ranking Member Issa--Ranking Member- elect Issa.",Speech,
"Mr. Issa","I think that is more appropriate.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","And I compliment you, Mr. Garrett, for your, I think, very constructive role. It has now been a little over 2 months since Congress passed legislation establishing TARP. A lot has happened in that time, some good and some bad. A particular concern of many members on this committee has been the Treasurer's ever- shifting strategies and explanations for its actions in implementing TARP, which have resulted in uncertainty among market participants and confusion among the American people. This has made it more difficult to achieve the goals that Congress has set in creating TARP and stabilizing the financial markets and increasing the flow of credit to Main Street. There has been some semblance of order restored in certain segments of the credit markets and among the financial service industry, and that is a good thing. No one faults Treasury for trying to tailor its policy responses to changing market conditions and challenges. But as the GAO report clearly states, implementing its various initiatives, Treasury has often failed to explain to Congress and the public what it hoped to achieve or to clearly communicate its expectations for the institutions that receive funding. For example, Treasury and the regulators have indicated recently that they expect the banks that have received an infusion of government money under the Capital Purchase Program to lend, rather than hoard, the cash. But the time to have thought about that, about what we expected banks to do with those funds, was before the money went out the door as a condition of investment rather than after the money was already in the banks' vault. That is why some of us in the negotiations on TARP asked if there would be conditions, and we were told that would limit the program. We talked about clawbacks, we talked about restrictions on dividends, we talked about something that Mr. LaTourette has complained about, and that is these banks using those funds to acquire their competitors or other banks. We think that is a serious matter. It is not in the legislation. But if there is any way to undo that admission, it needs to be done. Now I will close with this. I wonder whether Secretary Paulson or Mr. Kashkari, back when they were still working for Goldman Sachs, ever agreed to a deal in which billions of dollars changed hands, based on a 2-page application, without asking what the money was going to be used for or whether it was going to be paid back. For instance, the Uniform Residential Mortgage Application is 8 pages. The application for Federal Student Aid is 11 pages. When student lenders and mortgage companies ask more questions in lending thousands of dollars than the Federal Government does when it injects billions of dollars' worth of capital, we should all be concerned. The application process for the Capital Purchase Program, consisting of a 2-page form in which the bank identifies itself as a bank and asks for money and little else is very surprising. Secretary Paulson and Mr. Kashkari, you cannot be faulted for not having all the answers and for not being able to predict the future. But when you are acting on behalf of the American taxpayer, the taxpayer has the right to expect they will exercise the same basic judgment, the same standard of care that they would have exercised when they were working for Goldman Sachs and its investors. They should be held to the standard of care that we would expect from a reasonable, prudent investment banker whom I hope would not agree to a deal without doing some minimal amount of due diligence and conditions. Secretary Paulson and Mr. Kashkari should learn something from what we have seen in these past few weeks in connection with the committee's consideration of a possible bailout for the domestic auto industry. The CEOs of those automobile makers appeared before us to present detailed business plans showing how they intended to return their companies to profitability. They tried to justify their pleas for taxpayer help by admitting that their business models were flawed and explaining how they are going to change them. While the jury is still out on whether they made their case successfully, the detailed explanations and documents they put before us and the American people stand in stark contrast to the lack of information we have received from Treasury or from the financial institutions that have received taxpayer money under TARP. Let me close by thanking Chairman Frank for holding today's hearing, giving me the opportunity to focus on yesterday's hearing before the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, which was very important, and for inviting our colleague, the gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling, to testify on the important work being done by the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel. He has some concerns. I share those concerns, and I look forward to his testimony. I look forward to his insights and those of the other witnesses. Thank you.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Given the concern about time, how much time did the gentleman consume? Someone tell me how much time. The gentleman consumed 7\1/2\ minutes, so the gentleman has 12\1/2\ minutes left to allocate. We have consumed 5\1/2\ minutes, so we have 14\1/2\ minutes left. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 minutes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The oversight of the Troubled Assets Relief Program is inadequate and must quickly improve. Where it takes time to establish an appropriate oversight program, we have run out of time. Of the $350 billion allocated to Treasury to date, $335 billion has been spent or obligated. The Emergency Economic Stabilization Act became law on October 3rd and called for strong oversight. However, the first members of the Congressional Oversight Panel were not named until 6 weeks later, on November 14, 2008, and the Senate confirmed the special inspector general of TARP a mere 2 days ago. It was difficult to have quality oversight when the overseers did not exist. Surely Americans are baffled that corporations have, to date, been given taxpayer money with no strings attached and without transparency. The dire need for improvement is evident to everyone who reviewed the Government Accountability Office study released last week. It is full of examples of failed supervision. According to GAO, the Treasury has implemented TARP by directly investing $150 billion in 52 financial institutions. While the Treasury claims its purpose behind the Capital Purchase Program is to increase financing and to incur mortgage modifications, it makes no such demands that the capital recipient actually engage in those activities. The GAO also reports that institutions have no reporting requirements, and while the Treasury asks the companies to comply with executive compensation limits, no compliance mechanism is in place. Further, conflicts of interest have not been adequately addressed. According to GAO, the Treasury must prove its communication with both the Congress and the public. We deserve to know why and how the Treasury is implementing this program. Two of the members of the Congressional Oversight Panel are here with us today. We know that from press reports that Ms. Warren is dissatisfied with Treasury's lack of a clear sense of its fundamental purpose with regard to TARP, for what began as a troubled assets relief program has morphed into something entirely different. I look forward to learning more about the Congressional Oversight Panel's findings from today's testimony and its report. My hope is that greater oversight, transparency, and accountability will be pursued with the utmost urgency. If necessary, Congress should consider legislation to provide the special inspector general with broader powers. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Mr. Castle, for 1\1/2\ minutes.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thanks for continuing to hold hearings on the Troubled Asset Relief Program. I am concerned that when we passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, we developed layers of oversight for the Troubled Asset Relief Program and not a capital injections program, which is what we actually have been carrying out. I am pleased that GAO and Treasury have published these recent reports, which are very insightful on TARP's progress, but I would like to ask the witnesses today if they believe the regulations we have implemented need to be modified due to the Treasury's switch from a troubled asset buying plan to the capital purchase program. Additionally, Mr. Chairman, I am equally concerned about the almost $1 trillion in emergency loans and private asset purchases recently made by the Federal Reserve, and the absence of oversight we are dedicating to these expenditures. Section 129 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act requires oversight of decisions made by the Federal Reserve Board when acting pursuant to section 13-3 of the Federal Reserve Act. However, I believe the EESA requirements could go farther. The details of these emergency acts by the Fed are not subject to the same rigorous scrutiny that Congress required of Treasury actions made under the TARP. While I respect the long-established history of the Fed to keep intervention of institutions confidential under other sections of the Federal Reserve Act, these emergency actions have been widely reported in the press and subject to very limited review. I would welcome a hearing by this committee in consideration of the Government Accountability Office's review of the expenditures made by the Federal Reserve. Mr. Chairman, I would like to submit for the record a letter raising these concerns, which was given to your staff yesterday.",Speech,

"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. If there is one thing I regret, I regret attempting to be cooperative in providing to Treasury the flexibility to deal with our economic crisis. Not only, again, did I work very hard with members of this committee, but the Congressional Black Caucus, and the Hispanic Caucus, showing just how homeowners would be helped, how the loans would be modified, and ensuring them that I trusted the Treasury to do what it claimed it would do when they came to us to request this extraordinary amount of money without a lot of strings attached. And so here we are, and we don't have any systematic way of helping homeowners to modify these loans. The Treasury has refused to use their dollars to buy up the nonperforming assets. And the money has basically gone as equity investment in banks that are not putting the money back out so that our consumers can have access to credit. Take a look at what is happening in Chicago, where you have poor workers who are sitting in a Republic Windows and Door factory because Bank of America--to whom we gave $15 billion in TARP funds--refused a line of credit and refused to follow through on its commitment to finance the company. Now I don't know who the Treasury--I, too, don't know who they believe we are and what we can or cannot do, but I am sure, I am just sure that Mr. Kashkari, who is here today, has come to tell us how they are going to correct this. If he is not here to tell us how they are going to correct it, I am going to have to proceed with a bill that I am introducing that will basically place into law the program that Ms. Sheila Bair has put into place to do loan modifications, a proposal or program that she has shown can work because of what she has done with the takeover of IndyMac. And so the world is watching. Many communities are disadvantaged. We are losing the value of homes in communities across this country. The foreclosures continue to rise. And we sit here twiddling our thumbs, trusting Treasury to do what they said they were going to do. I want to hear from Mr. Kashkari today. They told us that this Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability would come with a program and plans that would help us out of this economic crisis--that he was a genius and we could expect great things from him. So far, I have seen nothing. And I know that in addition to what Sheila Bair has done, there are other proposals that have been brought to the Treasury for the modification of these loans so that we can stem the tide of foreclosures. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate everything that you have done, but I am not going to even cooperate with you anymore when you try to be reasonable. Now don't come back with a fast answer. I know you are about to do that. I just want you to know, as much as I respect you and do everything that I can to be supportive, you have been too kind, you have been too good, and you have allowed them to walk all over us. It doesn't feel good. These footprints on my back are just too tough. And we have to do something to make sure that the money that we are signing off on is used appropriately to help the consumers and homeowners of this country. Thank you. And please do not use your microphone.",Speech,

"Mr. Royce","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. The question of modifying these mortgages is one that I think we are all concerned with. I am interested in hearing the Comptroller General's comments and the Assistant Secretary's comments here. This week a new issue has sort of come to light, and one that I think all of us should be concerned about. The least expensive way for the taxpayers for these modifications of loan agreements to occur is by the loan servicers to concur that if you have, let's say, a 5-year ARM that is going to shoot up to 8 percent, it makes more sense to modify that loan and convert it into a 30-year loan at 6 percent and leave it on the books on the basis of the original term of the loan. What is it that keeps the loan servicers from modifying these agreements? The answer is a class action lawsuit last week has done exactly what some of us have counseled against, warned about. We need to have legislation in order to stop the chilling effect on mortgage servicers of bringing these class action lawsuits. This one last week, targeting 400,000 loan workouts, which kept borrowers in their homes and, frankly, worked to the benefit also of those who had lent the money; because at the end of the day, you lose 30 percent to 50 percent during a foreclosure in terms of the value of that asset. So many presume that this wasn't required by the way of legislation. Clearly it is. And if we do that, then arguably the 2.7 million loan workouts that we have seen--that haven't cost the taxpayers anything--done in concurrence with the work of our Treasury Department and attorneys general across the United States as these workouts have proceeded, that number can grow enormously. Those in the industry tell me the one thing that is keeping loan servicers from coming to the table is this issue. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from New York for 2 minutes.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for having this hearing. Regrettably, the report from GAO today makes clear that Treasury is not taking responsibility for making sure that the moneys are used consistently with the purposes of the Act. We will have to legislate that we want accountability, transparency, a systemic system with regulators so that we can track and find out where this money is going. A prime purpose of this Congress was to help people stay in their homes. I completely support FDIC Commissioner Sheila Bair's program, and am willing to legislate it with my colleagues. But we urge Treasury to put it in place. We do not know what banks are doing with their money because Treasury will not tell us. But the press tells us that they are buying highways in Europe, that they are buying other banks, or that they are holding on to the money. What my constituents tell me is they cannot have access to capital. We have put $7.8 trillion of taxpayers' money out there for the purpose of creating credit, and it has been a dismal failure. The car dealers were in my office yesterday from New York State. Americans want to buy their cars in New York State, but they cannot get credit from banks. What I am getting calls on is the proposed 4.5 percent interest rate to get new homes in the pipeline and get our economy moving. We need to get credit out in our communities in order to revive our economy. Economist after economist has told us we will not solve this crisis until we solve the problem of keeping people in their homes and getting the housing market moving again. I look forward to your proposal on the 4.5 percent interest rate--my phone has been ringing off the hook in support of it-- or any ideas or programs you have to get credit out into our economy to get our economy moving again. Thank you.",Speech,

"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you Mr. Chairman, and thank you for holding this hearing today. Briefly, I would like to say that I am disappointed in several findings of the GAO report. First, Treasury has yet to establish an insurance program, which I think is critical to the matter of determining the value of the liquid assets on the books of the financial institutions, not to mention helping us to understand the magnitude of the problem. Second, Treasury has yet to set up a loan modification program to help worthy borrowers stay in their homes. Third, and most importantly, it baffles me that there are no reports about where American tax dollars are going once a TARP check is written to a financial institution. With billions of dollars at stake, taxpayers deserve regular reports on how their money is being used to keep both financial institutions and our economy afloat. There must be far more accountability and transparency weaved into the implementation of this program. I hope that today's hearing will give us an opportunity to hear Mr. Kashkari outline a concrete timetable as to when these items will be addressed. With that, let me say I look forward to today's hearing, and I yield back.",Speech,

"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I want to be as concise as I can and make this very clear. We live in a world where it is not enough for things to be right; they must also look right. And it may have been right to convince the American public that we would spend some of this $700 billion on mortgage-backed securities by way of a reverse mortgage process; it may have been right, but it doesn't look right when that kind of course change takes place and the American public is left without a clear and concise understanding of what happened. That has to be explained sufficiently to the public or it does create some harm as we move forward and make attempts to do the just thing in a time of economic crisis. I yield back the balance of my time.",Speech,

"Mrs. Capito","I want to thank you for holding this hearing today, and I look forward to learning the progress of the TARP program. As many of my colleagues did, I opposed the creation of the TARP for three basic reasons: It was too fast; had too much risk for the taxpayers; and it did not contain enough oversight. Since the creation of the TARP, we have seen several iterations of the plan. My major question today is, you keep shifting the plan, the plan keeps going to different facets of the financial markets, and is this working and is it accounted for? The recent GAO report expresses concern that there is not sufficient oversight of the TARP within the Treasury. That, to me, is alarming. Proper oversight is needed to assure that the Treasury is being good stewards of the taxpayer dollars, but also to guarantee that institutions participating in the new Capital Purchase Program are complying with the limitations that are within those programs. I can assure you the American taxpayers were certainly leery of this program to begin with. We must work together to make sure companies utilizing the TARP and the Capital Purchase Program follow important guidelines and find out the status of those initiatives. I look forward to this hearing today. I am really astounded that as we move forward, the oversight portion of this huge program has not been one of the most detailed and most communicated parts of the program with the initiative that certainly I felt in my constituency, and felt in the constituency across the country, questioning the expenditure of $700 billion of taxpayers' dollars. Thank you.",Speech,
"The Chairman","We will go to the gentleman from New Jersey for 1\1/2\ minutes, so we can balance it off.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","I thank the chairman and the ranking member as well. When Congress passed the Economic Stabilization Act, which created TARP, I also did not support the legislation, and I voiced many serious concerns that it was not the best solution to address the credit crisis. I advocated that Congress take a little bit more time to examine other alternatives, consider possible unintended consequences, and put in proper safeguards to make sure the money is actually spent appropriately. Had that been done, maybe members today who voted in favor of it would not have regrets. Unfortunately, Congress rushed ahead, passed an open-ended bill that was sold to members as an asset purchasing plan, but was instead used to inject capital into the banking industry. Because the capital injection authority was really buried throughout the several different sections of the text and very little discussion was given during the debate to the strategy, apparently none of the appropriate safeguards--to include necessary provisions to guarantee the banks would actually lend the money and not hoard the capital or use it to pay dividends or buy other assets--were included in the bill. If you had taken that legislation through the regular legislative process and had a committee markup, allowed amendments, perhaps we would have addressed some of the concerns that are being raised today. I am also worried that we are making the same mistake right now with the auto bailout legislation being drafted. Democrat leadership and the Administration do not have a monopoly on good ideas. I think it would be very helpful for more members to have an opportunity to present ideas on how to improve that piece of important legislation as well. Also, I am also concerned with the amount of time it has now taken for the Congressional TARP Oversight Committee to be established, before hiring staff. With that, I yield back.",Speech,
"The Chairman","The gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, for 1 minute.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","There are not just those who supported the bill and those who rejected it, but many of us who wanted to adopt a very different bill. Among those appear to be Secretary Paulson himself, who testified on September 18th that he would use the TARP bill only to buy toxic assets and not to buy preferred stock; then, by October 3rd, had changed his mind, buttoned his lips, and had us vote on what we thought was a toxic asset plan, only to have the Treasury implement its preferred stock asset plan. I might have voted for the preferred stock investment plan, not because it is all that effective, but because it is far less expensive than the original toxic asset purchase plan. Being a basically nice guy, let me use this opportunity not to praise the frugality of the Treasury, rather than to disparage its duplicity. While we talk about the cost of the bill, let us recognize it would cost the Treasury even less if we had negotiated tough with the banks. Instead, we got half the yield and one-sixth the warrants that private investors were able to get on similar transactions. Had we not played Santa Claus, had we not accepted the same number of warrants from those banks that posed very large risk to the Treasury as we accepted from those who posed less risks, we would have a smaller Federal debt to pass on to our children.

"Ms. Brown-Waite","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Thank you for holding this hearing today. Over the past 2 months, a number of my constituents have contacted me about problems they are having with foreclosures and also obtaining loans. One of them is a small, very successful businessman in my district, who has had an account with his bank, which is the same bank, by the way, that received billions in bailout money. They are now blaming the financial crisis on the fact that they are substantially curtailing his line of credit. What does that mean? It means he is going to have to lay off people. It means he may very well be closing his business because right now he is operating it on his retirement funds that he is using to keep his employees employed. Far from using the money from the Capital Purchase Program to increase the flow of financing to businesses, homeowners, and consumers, banks are actually hoarding the cash in their vaults. And if they are not hoarding it, they are using that cash for mergers and acquisitions. This should have been foreseen. I voted against the bailout because it lacked a very clear plan and enough oversight to prevent our current situation. Let me be clear, I didn't support the bailout programs proposed by",Speech,
"Secretary Paulson","However, many of my colleagues did. I believe that they thought that it would help the consumers. With this lack of oversight, clearly we have been sold a pig in a poke and a bait-and-switch has occurred. That is not fair to the taxpayers who are funding this massive bailout. I hope we hear more about plans to protect not the banks, not the investors, but the taxpayers today. Thank you. I yield back.",Speech,

The people sitting at that table looking at us ought to be Secretary Paulson and the Treasury Department and the banks. We have been lied to; the American people have been lied to. We have been bamboozled; they came to us to ask for money for one thing, then used it for another. They said we would have oversight, and no oversight is in place. We have given these banks $290 billion for the sole purpose of so-called buying these toxics. They change it, and all of a sudden now they are not lending it but using it for acquisitions, using it for salaries. These are lies. We have been bamboozled. The Secretary of the Treasury owes us an explanation about this, owes the American people an explanation about this. We have the auto companies coming to us. In a few days, we are going to give them a $15 billion loan. When they were here, we asked them, why can't you go to the banks? The banks won't lend it. Here we have sent them $290 billion, but they won't lend it. Why won't the banks lend the money to small businesses and the American people? That is the question.",Speech,

"Mr. Watt","Thank you for convening this very important hearing. I really want to focus in on some very practical issues related to the use of the money that has been approved. When toxic assets were proposed to be purchased, a set of professionals were hired to administer that program. We received the announcement of who those professionals were. Then, right after, the whole focus of the program shifted from purchase of toxic assets to investments in banks, purchase of equity positions or preferred stock positions, or whatever. The professionals who had been hired under contract to administer that program, the toxic asset program, continued under contract and have continued to be paid. I would be interested in knowing, if they were hired to do the administration of toxic assets, what exactly are they doing now with taxpayer money? These are multimillion-dollar contracts that we entered into, or at least hundreds of thousands of dollars of contracts that we entered into to administer a program that was never put in place. And it seems to me that we have a responsibility to know what those people who were under contract to do are now doing with taxpayer money. So that is one of the focuses that I will be pursuing today. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,

At the risk of being counterfactual, let me be clear, I appreciate the way that you have held these oversight hearings and expect them to continue into the future. We saw recently the auto companies appear right at that table because they requested tens of billions of dollars of taxpayer money. And yet as we continue to go through this process, we see no CEO or anyone from the financial institutions that have, to date, received hundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer money. I hope that in the future, we can correct that. I don't care if they take a yacht, I don't care if they hitchhike; I think they should be here to account for what they did to put us where we are, how they will get us out of this, what they will do with the money they have received, and how it will help working Americans.

"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Just recently, the budget deficit numbers for the first 2 months of this October- November were released, and it is half-a-trillion dollars. At that clip, that means we are on tap to do a $6 trillion deficit if things continue. One of the things that actually boggles my mind is that we are passing out billions of dollars without a plan. The Treasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve have come to this group and they have talked about how we are trying to stabilize the markets. But we really don't have a defined plan with stated results so that the oversight board can actually monitor what is going on. You can't go borrow money, as small businessmen in America, on the basis that the money is being passed out by the Treasury. What we need and what the oversight board needs is, we need to have some measurements that we are at some expectations, and we need an overall plan because we can't keep just throwing money at this problem until it gets better, because there is not an unlimited supply of money because we are spending money that we don't have. We are spending the next generation's money on the basis that we are operating now. The numbers people are throwing are anywhere from $4 trillion to $7 trillion. I think that is a number that the oversight board needs to know. I think we need to know what the direct and contingent liabilities of all of the entities that are involved in this process have committed the American taxpayers to. But, more importantly, if you are going to have oversight, you have to have a plan to oversee, and there is no plan, and that should be of great concern to the American people because it is a great concern to me.",Speech,

"Mr. Heller","I appreciate the opportunity to spend a few minutes here in this hearing to discuss what I am hearing as frustration in the community banking, especially the small community banks across this country. As they go to the Web site, they fill out these applications and wait. They literally wait, wondering when and if these TARP funds will become available. I think this frustration, as I continue to get these phone calls--they want to know what the criteria are. ``We filled out the 2-page application, and we heard nothing.'' What are the thresholds, what are the expectations, what are the criteria to know the difference--is it assets, is it deposits? What is the threshold that is going to determine between a small bank and a big bank whether they receive assistance? Because these small community banks are not lending, they are saying they are not lending. In fact, most of them are just wondering if we are sitting around, waiting to be acquired by people who do receive TARP funds. So I am hoping that we can get answers to some of these questions. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.",Speech,
"The Chairman","This side has 30 seconds remaining. I am just going to use it to respond to a very important point made by the gentleman from California, Mr. Royce, about the lawsuits interfering with servicers. The gentleman from California has consistently raised that. This committee is determined next year to change the legislation defining legal rights here, so that we will not have this continuing ambiguity about servicers. I will say, though, that acting on the initiative of the gentleman from Pennsylvania, Mr. Kanjorski, and the gentleman from Delaware, Mr. Castle, we did include in the legislation that we passed as good a clarification as we could have going forward that servicers who do what is economically in the best interest of the holders of those loans should not be sued. The only further step we could take would be to indemnify them. The problem there is you would be using taxpayer dollars. And if the holder of the loan could sue the servicer and we then indemnified the servicer, you would put taxpayer dollars in the hands of the people who made these bad loans. I don't believe there would be any support for that. The last thing I would say is the gentleman from California correctly mentioned a class action lawsuit. Of all the outrageous acts of social irresponsibility I have ever seen, it is the lead plaintiff in that lawsuit who bought paper solely for the purpose of doing it. We are not talking here of an owner who, having made the loans or having acquired the loans, subsequently ran into this problem. He bought that paper after the fact, I believe solely for the purpose of lawsuits. It is greatly irresponsible. I have spoken to Treasury, and I think it is very important that we encourage Bank of America, which is the target of this suit, to stand up and fight that lawsuit. I hope there will be amicus briefs filed by the United States Government, by ourselves and others, because I think this is a scurrilous, socially irresponsible effort by someone who has no legitimate problem, because he is not talking about loans that had been previously been made. I do think that the gentleman from California hit on an important problem. It is important that we deal with it at every level. With that, we call up our witnesses. We have the Acting Comptroller General and the Interim Assistant Secretary. One of these days, we will get back into actual people. But we do appreciate the very hard work that both gentlemen are doing in their status. Mr. Dodaro is the Acting Comptroller General of the Government Accountability Office. And I would just say, for people who want to know whether the Government Accountability Office puts its principles into practice, they are for saving money. We changed the name from the Government Accounting Office to a more descriptive name, the Government Accountability Office. But you will notice that we did it in a way that does not require them to change their towels; it is still the GAO. So we all deserve credit for that efficiency. And Mr. Neel Kashkari, who is the Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. Mr. Dodaro, we will begin with you.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Good morning to you and to the members of the committee. I am pleased to be here today to discuss GAO's efforts to evaluate the TARP program to date. Soon after the legislation was enacted on October the 3rd, we moved quickly to put our team in place. And, as mentioned, we issued our first report within the 60-day requirement under the legislation last week, on December the 2nd. Now, that report outlines the actions that the Treasury Department has taken to date to implement the program and recognizes the challenges that they faced in starting a new program from scratch. The report also, however, points out several critical issues that are not yet addressed. And, as a result, we made a series of recommendations that we think are very important and that, if properly implemented, can improve the integrity, the accountability, and the transparency of this very important program. Those recommendations fell into four general categories. The first dealt with ensuring that the funds are being used in compliance with the legislation and that requirements, such as limits on executive compensation and payment of dividends, are complied with. To date, Treasury hadn't finalized its strategy for monitoring these very important initiatives. So we recommended that the Treasury Department work with the financial regulators which are already in place to develop a systematic means for ensuring that there is monitoring and reporting on the use of the funds to ensure that it is consistent with the Act and that it is being done in a timely fashion, and that there be an effective monitoring program put in place to ensure that the program requirements are adhered to by the institutions receiving the funds. The second area had to do with the communications strategy. As has been pointed out this morning in virtually every member's opening comments, the program has undergone a lot of changes. And, in addition to that, the economic situation has been rather fluid. Because of all these changes, that really put a premium on having effective communications to not only explain by Treasury as to what they were doing but why they were undertaking the initiative. So we recommended that they give this area and the communications strategy some additional attention. The third area has to do with people, having the right numbers and skills necessary to effectively carry out this program. To date, Treasury has made many efforts to try to bring people onboard on an interim status. But they have yet to bring on the full complement of people that they need in order to effectively manage the program over time. We recommended that they expedite their hiring practices and also put in place a comprehensive plan to ensure a smooth transition to the next Administration. Right now, they only have a very limited number of people who are committed to make that change going forward. The fourth area has to do with a comprehensive system of internal controls. Treasury recognizes that they need internal controls. In fact, one of the contractors that was hired was brought in to help them craft the system. And so, you know, we gave them credit for acknowledging that they need to do this. But the system needs to be fully designed and put into place. And a couple of areas that are really important, one is overseeing contractors. To date, the contractors that have been hired have been on a time and materials basis, which puts the onus more on the government to manage the contractors, so that they need additional people to be able to do that properly. We recommended also that, in the future, to the extent that the Department can, they put in place fixed-price contracts to provide the necessary support for them going forward. We also recommended that the Department finalize their regulations on conflict of interest and put in place a robust monitoring effort to make sure that the conflict-of-interest provisions and the associated mitigation plans that are put in place are properly implemented going forward so that there are proper safeguards in place. In summary, in our first report and set of recommendations, we believe--or have very important suggestions for the Treasury Department to implement, to ensure that this program has the accountability, has the transparency necessary and what the expectations are going forward. We plan to continue to work with the Treasury Department to monitor their implementation of those recommendations and also the TARP program, as it continues to unfold in the coming months. I would ask, Mr. Chairman, that our detailed report of December 2nd be submitted into the record, since it was statutorily required, along with my testimony today, if that would be permissible. And I would be happy to answer any questions members may have at the appropriate period of time. Thank you very much.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE GENE L. DODARO, ACTING COMPTROLLER GENERAL OF THE UNITED STATES, U.S. GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Dodaro. Without objection, the gentleman's request is agreed to. Mr. Kashkari?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Good morning, Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus, and members of the committee. Thank you for asking me to testify before you today regarding oversight of the Troubled Asset Relief Program. We are in an unprecedented period, and market events are moving rapidly and unpredictably. We at Treasury have responded quickly to adapt to events on the ground. Throughout the crisis, we have always acted with the following critical objectives: One, to stabilize financial markets and reduce systemic risk; two, to support the housing market by avoiding preventable foreclosures and supporting mortgage finance; and three, to protect the taxpayers. The authority and the flexibility granted to us by the Congress has been essential to developing the programs necessary to meet those objectives. Today, I will describe the many steps we are taking to ensure compliance with both the letter and the spirit of the law and what measurements we look at to gauge our success. A program as large and complex as the TARP would normally take many months or years to establish. Given the severity of the financial crisis, we must build the Office of Financial Stability, we must design our programs, and we must execute our programs all at the same time. We have made remarkable progress since the President signed the law only 68 days ago. The first topic I will address is oversight of the TARP. We first moved immediately to establish the Financial Stability Oversight Board. The board has already met 5 times in the 2 months since the law was signed, with numerous staff calls between meetings. We have also posted bylaws and minutes from those board meetings on the Treasury Web site. Second, the law requires an appointment of a Senate- confirmed special inspector general to oversee the program. We welcome the Senate's confirmation, just on Monday, of Mr. Barofsky as special IG. I spoke with him just yesterday, and we look forward to working closely with his office. In the interim, pending his confirmation, we have been coordinating closely with the Treasury's inspector general. We have had numerous meetings with Treasury's Inspector General to keep them apprised of all TARP activity. And we look forward to continuing our active dialogue with both the Treasury IG and the special IG as he builds up his office. Third, the law calls for the GAO to establish a physical presence at Treasury to monitor the program. We have had numerous briefings with GAO, and our respective staffs meet or speak on an almost daily basis to update them on the program and review contracts. The GAO published its first report on the TARP, as Mr. Dodaro said, on December 2nd. They provided a thorough review of the TARP program and progress to date, essentially a snapshot in time at the 60-day mark of a large, complex project that continues to be a successful work in progress. We are pleased with our auditors' recommendations, because the GAO has identified topics that we are already focused on. The report was quite helpful to us because it provided us with thoughtful, independent verification that we are, indeed, focused in the right topics. And we agree with the GAO on the importance of these issues. Our work continues. Finally, the law called for the establishment of a congressional oversight panel, the fourth oversight body to review the TARP. That oversight panel was recently formed, and we had our first meeting with them on Friday, November 21st. We look forward to having additional meetings with the congressional oversight panel. Now, people often ask, how do we know our programs are working? First, and this is very important, we did not allow the financial system to collapse. That is the most important information that we have. Second, the system is fundamentally more stable than it was when Congress passed the legislation. While it is difficult to isolate one program's effects, given the numerous steps that policymakers have taken, one indicator that points to reduced risk among default of financial institutions is the average credit default swap spread for the eight largest U.S. banks. That CDS spread has declined 200 basis points since before Congress passed the law. Another key indicator of perceived risk in the financial system is the spread between LIBOR and OIS. The 1-month and 3- month LIBOR-OIS spreads have each declined 100 basis points since the law was signed and 180 basis points from their peak before the CPP was announced on October 14th. People also ask, when will we see banks making new loans? First, we must remember that just over half the money allocated to the Capital Purchase Program is out the door. Although we are executing at report speed, it will still take a few months to process all of the remaining applications. The money needs to get into the system before it can have the desired effect. Second, we are still at a point of low confidence, both due to the financial crisis and due to the economic downturn. As long as confidence remains low, banks will remain cautious about extending credit, and consumers and businesses will remain cautious about taking on new loans themselves. As confidence returns, we expect to see more credit extended. We are actively engaged with regulators to determine the best way to monitor these capital investments in bank lending. We may utilize a variety of supervisory information for insured depositories, including the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act data, the Community Reinvestment Act data, call report data, examination information contained in CRA public evaluations, as well as broader financial data and conditions. In conclusion, while we have made significant progress, we recognize that challenges lie ahead. As Secretary Paulson has said, there is no single action the Federal Government can take to end the financial market turmoil or the economic downturn, but the new authorities that you provided, you and your colleagues provided in October, dramatically expanded the tools available to address the needs of our system. We are confident we are pursuing the right strategy to stabilize the financial system and support the flow of credit to the economy. Thank you again for having me here today, and I would be happy to take your questions.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE NEEL KASHKARI, INTERIM ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR FINANCIAL STABILITY AND ASSISTANT SECRETARY FOR INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS, U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Secretary. Mr. Secretary, it is sometimes, in my opinion, sort of unfortunate that we don't have more of a mix of associating between Members of Congress and the Executive Branch. But when you are in a role such as mine, you get to hear very often the opinions of Members out of the public realm and off the newspapers, but their honest opinions of what happened. And I think one of our colleagues, yesterday at a caucus, made a great observation, Mr. Kucinich of Ohio. He posed the question, after all the turmoil of the last 10 or 12 weeks, why is it that we do not have the beginning of an industrial policy in this country so that, as we start structuring the recovery acts and various programs, we don't have a standard or a base to measure what we are doing against? I thought that was a good observation. And now working on the auto recovery program, having worked tirelessly just 6 or 8 weeks ago on the ``bailout'' of Wall Street, I am beginning to think that somebody has to become a drafter of a master plan of what we are going to do, what we intend to do, what we are doing, so that we have some measure of objective judgment or understanding. Now I, for one, have been very sympathetic to the Secretary and to the Administration. And you obviously know I am on the other side of the aisle, politically, from the Administration. Because I think that we are in such a challenge in our economic structure that we have to tell the American people the truth, and that truth is going to hurt. Some of that truth is we are going to spend billions of dollars incorrectly and wrongfully and wastefully. And they are going to have to know that, because we are like mad scientists in an economic laboratory trying to get the correct potion to resolve this problem. And I don't know that anyone has gotten that. So that we can't be harsh judges of what the Administration is doing and hold you to such a high order when, in fact, none of us know what the true answer is. I think as you have testified and just indicated, nobody does really know. On the other hand, it is very disconcerting to listen to the Secretary come up here 1 week, as he did in September, and tell us the sky was falling, and I can't even repeat some of the issues that were raised by him and Dr. Bernanke, in terms of they are still confidential and secret, as I understand it. But they did shake the hell out of Congress, I can tell you that. We did react within a couple of weeks to pass the rescue program, and in my opinion, we did it inadequately. We didn't accrete the Office of the Inspector General with the powers necessary to really do the job. We didn't get the people in place on the oversight board. We didn't get the inspector general, until 2 days ago, appointed. And we really up here don't know what is totally going on. But I keep looking at the Administration. And Mr. Paulson, when he called that reverse in the backfield, going from purchasing toxic assets to making investments, and he did it overnight without any pre-information, just did it, and now he has been making these calls, totally reversing the position of where we thought we were going and where we were informed previously in the huddle as to where we were going, it is starting to shake our confidence. And when I say that, it is not just the confidence of the Congress. We are probably not important in that regard. But we do represent, to an extent, the confidence of the American people. And, to a large extent, we are not coming out of this economic problem until we build the confidence of the American people. I think, by that nature, we have to build a relationship between the Administration and the Congress to build our confidence, because, in some respects, we do represent the American people. When do you see a capacity that you are going to come forward and tell us what your plan is, what we can expect, perhaps developing an industrial policy for this country, and to give everybody a little comfort that we seem to know what we are doing and we have a game plan to play the whole game?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, thank you for the question. Let me answer it in two parts. First, in terms of the remaining use of the TARP funds, right now we are executing the programs that we have announced. So we have announced the Capital Purchase Program. We are deep in execution; the execution is going quite well. We can discuss that, and I am sure members have views. Second, we have announced, the Federal Reserve has announced a program for asset-backed securitization facility, which is going to get consumer credit going--auto lending, consumer loans, student loans, etc. That program in the process of being developed and stood up. That also will use $20 billion from the TARP. In terms of future programs, we have a lot of policy development work going on. That policy development work, in many cases, is we are consulting with the transition team to keep them informed of what we are developing. At this point, there has been no determination made by the Secretary on whether or when to request further funds from the Congress, the $350 billion. If that determination were to be made, he would do it, consult with the transition team, also notify Congress and provide details of exactly what our plans would be for those remaining funds, number one. Number two, in terms of a master industrial policy, candidly, Congressman, that is not something that I have spent much time thinking about. My focus, and I think the Treasury Department's focus right now, is just to ensure the stability of the financial system so that credit can flow to our communities and our consumers and our businesses. I think that, as a Nation, my personal perspective is, once we get through the immediate crisis, we need to take a step back and thoughtfully review our regulatory system to make sure we don't get back here again in the future. Sometimes it is hard to make those judgments in the middle of a crisis.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much. I wish we could go on, but we have others. Let uss turn to the ranking member now, Mr. Bachus.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Well, it might take a while. Mr. Dodaro, the original asset purchase program, it had a pretty extensive mechanism to administer the program, you know, where we would pay fair value or fair price, etc., etc., you know, and that the goals would be realized. Has the Treasury adopted a similar detailed mechanism to ensure that the Capital Purchase Program fulfills its goals?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","The Department has been largely relying on the regulators for the industries to help in their process for determining which institutions they will approve under the Capital Purchase Program and that the institutions are sound and financially viable going forward. So I think relying on the regulators was a good step in that process going forward. What our--",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Let me ask you, when you say relying on regulators to inject capital into this, hold off on that, what about the State-chartered institutions? Is there a bias against them? Are they also consulting with--",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","I think all the institutions are going through the same process.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","All right.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","The applications come in, are screened by the regulators, and then they go forward to the Treasury Department, where Mr. Kashkari then makes the decision, you know, going forward with the process. What our recommendations are focused on is, once the Capital Purchase Programs are approved and the money is then transferred to the institutions, that is where we see the need to have greater monitoring by the regulators, more timely reporting. The regulators get a lot of information--",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Is that into what they are doing with the money?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, yes. That is what they are doing with the money, whether it is consistent with the purposes of the Act, and what kind of effect is it having to achieve the program's objectives.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","I understand. Is there leverage under the law, or under the lending regulations, to require them to lend it, as opposed to, say, they pay the amount of dividend or to make acquisitions? I will ask Mr. Kashkari or either one of you gentlemen.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Basically--and Mr. Kashkari can elaborate on this--my understanding is the requirements that are signed basically require the institutions to spend the funds in accordance with the purposes of the act.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Okay.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","And, Congressman, I would just add that the contracts that these banks--we have now funded 87 banks in 30 States. The contracts that we have entered into restrict their dividends; they cannot increase their dividends. They cannot do a share buy-back. So we have put--",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Yes, I know they can't increase it, but they are using it to pay and maintain the dividend.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","That is correct. And, again, one of the keys here is we want to attract private capital to our banking system. To come in to healthy banks and wipe out all their dividends would drive away private capital. We want to encourage private capital. And may I respectfully repeat that this is a program for healthy institutions of all sizes. Hundreds, potentially thousands, of banks from across the country are applying. We feel great about that.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","In fact, you know, we had conversations that we wanted all the banks to participate. Now, I wasn't in the end game there, but let me ask you about that. The Subchapter S banks, a third of the banks are in that case. You still haven't come up with a program for them, have you?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Not yet. We have professionals at Treasury working on it and consulting with outside experts. It is a very complex legal issue. Our program intention is that every bank in America that is healthy gets to participate on equal terms. There are some real legal complexities on how to make equity investments in Subchapter S and mutuals. And if you can make the investments, how do you get it out in the end so that the taxpayers can get their money back in the future? We are looking hard at that.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Right. I think there are 2,500 such institutions. Let me ask you this. You know, the switch from troubled assets to capital injection, did that imply that it was a solvency issue as well as a liquidity issue?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, this has always been about capital. Buying troubled assets, the initial plan was also focused on getting more capital into the system and freeing up their balances sheets. The Secretary made the determination to lead with capital, because, although Congress moved with lightning speed, just 2 weeks between when Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke came to the Congress and the legislation was passed and signed, credit markets deteriorated rapidly. And we realized very quickly that we had to lead with capital. The key for an asset purchase--",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","And I agree with that. As you know, I proposed that in the first meeting.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","The key, Congressman, for an asset purchase program to work is it must be done on a very, very large scale. And once it became clear that we had to lead with significant capital and maybe more capital, we would be left with a very much smaller asset purchase program that may not be big enough to do the trick.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","Okay. Let me say this, and I will close with this question. You know, you have done repeated capital injections into AIG and Citigroup. I say repeated; it is over $100 billion in the case of AIG. You know, have you required any corrective action on their part, similar to what you are hearing about the auto companies today, as opposed to what you--",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We should segment--this is very important; I am glad you raised it--we should segment failing institutions, such as AIG, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, from the healthy bank program. If you look at our track record, in the case of AIG, Fannie, and Freddie, in each case we replaced the management. The taxpayers got 80 percent of the equity of those institutions. Their existing shareholders paid the ultimate price. And so, when we have a situation like that, we are very, very aggressive to protect the taxpayers. When we have a healthy bank program and we want thousands of banks to participate, we want to make it attractive for them to volunteer to participate in the program, not to scare them off.",Speech,
"Mr. Bachus","And I like that model, as opposed to having the Congress or the Administration micromanage these operations; you replace the management. I think maybe that might be a model for some, not all, but some of our automobile companies, too. Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Bachus. And now we will hear from Ms. Waters.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Thank you very much. Mr. Kashkari, you know that I and some of the others are focused on trying to save homeowners and stop these foreclosures so that American citizens can remain in their homes. You have done nothing, Treasury has done nothing, to pursue any program, except I think begrudgingly you took Ms. Sheila Bair's program and applied it to, I guess, Citigroup, when you gave them all of that money. If it is good enough for the Citigroup program, why hasn't it been applied to all of the banks, or why didn't you go back to purchasing the toxic paper and doing loan modifications? What is your resistance to helping homeowners stay in their homes and to stopping these foreclosures?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, thank you for asking. This is a very important topic. And, if you will permit me, I am going to give you three parts to the answer. The first part is Secretary Paulson came to the Congress to ask for this legislation to prevent a financial collapse. And if you will permit me, imagine how many foreclosures we would have had if we had allowed the financial system to collapse, number one. Number two, we continue to work very hard at Treasury, within the Administration, with the Federal Reserve, in consultation with the transition team, looking at various foreclosure mitigation policies--",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Taking back my time, why haven't you adopted the Sheila Bair program?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","These programs are more complicated than they seem on the surface.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Why was it good enough for Citigroup?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","That was a request that the FDIC made as part of the negotiation. If you will permit me to complete my answer--",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","No, I can't, because what you are doing is you are just going over what you have already said. And I really want to focus on why we don't have a comprehensive program to deal with the foreclosures and helping homeowners stay in their homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac adopted a program. Do you like that program?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, actually, thank you for raising that. That is where I was going to go. We are trying to use the right tool for the right job. So, for example, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we worked with FHFA and with Fannie and Freddie to adopt a streamlined model. Why that is so important, Congresswoman, is because most of the pooling and servicing agreements for private mortgage-backed securities, subprimes, point to the Fannie/Freddie servicing standards for how their loans need to be serviced. So, by imposing those at Fannie and Freddie, we have now adopted a new industrywide standard with a streamlined protocol. If we had spent all $700 billion buying whole loans, we could have bought 3 million to 4 million loans. As you know, there are 55 million loans in America. Versus, using Fannie and Freddie, we can now touch almost every loan in America by establishing this new standard.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Well, let me, if I can, take back my time again. By simply working on Fannie and Freddie, you cannot--you cannot--cover all of those loans that are out there, those mortgages. And let me just say this: You have resisted working with Sheila Bair, with what we think is a legitimate program. You have had a program presented by RLJ Companies, Mr. Bob Johnson, that talked about dealing with the services problem. You have just ignored him, and you have not responded to what looks like a legitimate way in which to deal with these foreclosures. You don't have a comprehensive plan to deal with foreclosures. Now the scam artists have taken over. I just recently responded to a scam artist that--the name of the company is the Federal Loan Modification Program. I gave them phony criteria as a consumer about a foreclosure. They assured me that I qualified for their program, and they asked me for $3,500. And you are doing nothing about that. The scam artists are now filling the gap of a lack of assistance to American consumers and homeowners that Treasury should be dealing with. And so you talk about or allude to the other $350 billion. Please don't come here and ask for another penny. Because, if you do, I am going to work 24 hours a day with the same people that I worked with to support you to make sure that they do not support giving you another dime. President-elect Obama has said that he wanted to do something for the homeowners. You have not even followed up with that request, with that signal that he has sent. And you come here and tell us about how you have saved all of the economy with what you have done. One question, have you called Bank of America? Did you get them involved in helping to extend the financing to the door company in Chicago where people have been sitting in? Did you ask them to do anything?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We have not talked to Bank of America.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Why not? You gave them, what, $15 billion?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, I don't know the details of that instance.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Well, you should. They have been in the media. You should be embarrassed by that.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, Congresswoman, it is not appropriate for me, as a Treasury official, to comment on specific loans or specific banks in that regard. They have a bank regulator, the OCC, that is their primary Federal regulator, that has dozens of staff on site at Bank of America every day as part of their normal supervisory activity.",Speech,
"Ms. Waters","Okay. I appreciate that you think that is not appropriate, but let me tell you what is appropriate. It is appropriate, when you come before this committee, where we have worked very hard to follow your lead on buying up all that toxic paper, it is appropriate for you to tell us why you didn't do it. You haven't done a good job of that, and you still come without a program to deal with that. I yield back the balance of my time. And I thank you very much, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Ms. Waters. And now, we will hear from Mr. Neugebauer.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","Thank you. Mr. Kashkari, can you tell me a little bit--87 different entities, banks that you have bought, I guess, warrants and preferred stock in. What was the criteria? I mean, I am looking at this amount. Some people got $10 billion; some people got $17 million. What was the criteria on how much money you got?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Sure. Congressman, we established a standard program where banks of all sizes could apply for between 1 percent and 3 percent of their risk-weighted assets. So it is an equal deal for all banks in the country. They submit their application to their primary regulator, who reviews the application, makes a recommendation to Treasury. We review their recommendation and make a final decision. This is meant to be a healthy bank program so that, if a regulator deems an institution is not viable, they will likely not recommend them for the program. But in terms of the amount, the guidelines are 1 percent to 3 percent of assets. So, although, you know, some banks got as high as $25 billion, the smallest amount has been less than $2 million. That is because there are huge banks and there are little banks.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","Sure. What about the pricing? Was everybody's pricing the same?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Identical.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","And so, does that say that every one of those entities is an equal risk of that capital that you are putting in there?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","That is a good question. It is very hard for us to go out and value individually the thousands and thousands of banks around the country. So we felt that the fairest way to go was to apply the same terms for everybody so they could all apply. So long as their regulator deems that they are a healthy, viable bank, then they would be able to participate on the same terms as their neighbors, big or small.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","And when these banks applied for this money, did they present a business plan? For example, ``If you put $2.2 billion in my bank, this is what we are going to do with it?''",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Not specifically. In some cases, banks offered some indicator. We felt that--a couple of things on this, because it is very important. The overall purpose was to put more capital in the financial system, to increase the strength of the system and, over time, increase lending. By putting more capital in, restricting dividends and restricting share repurchases, the banks have very strong economic incentive to want to put that money to work. If they don't put it to work, their return on equity, their return on assets will go down, so their returns will suffer. So we wanted to put the right economic incentives in there. But, at the same time, thousands of banks across the country in all of our communities--it is very hard for us to try to micromanage and say, ``This is how you should run your business,'' because each bank, and each community, is a little bit different. So we wanted to work with the regulators to identify the healthy banks, put capital in on the same terms, and then create the economic incentives for them to want to go make new loans.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","When you look at the economy and markets, many would say that markets are a reflection of the economy. And when I look at the plan that Treasury and the Federal Reserve put forward, it appears to me you are trying to address the market structure, when, fundamentally, I think what a lot of people--and somebody said a while ago, we owe the American people the truth. We do owe them the truth. The truth is we have fundamental problems with the overall economy, which I think are being reflected in the markets. And so would you say this plan tries to address markets or it tries to address the economy?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","That is a great question. I am glad you asked it. This is an economic stabilization plan to prevent a financial system collapse, to stabilize the financial system. It is not an economic growth plan, an economic stimulus plan. Those are very different. And our energy is focused on making sure the financial system is stable so that credit can flow. The economy has real challenges, as you indicated. And that is not going to be addressed. Even if we execute the TARP perfectly, that is different than stabilizing the financial system.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","But the question is, then, were we trying to--you say this is a healthy bank program. Many of these banks said they would not have ever probably participated in this, but, you know, it is kind of like, if the candy jar was out there, I think we should go and get some of those. So we have banks probably that are very healthy, very stable, still they were making loans, participating in the market, but now we have encouraged them to participate in this program. And so I kind of wonder how that is addressing the market.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Right. If we have a dollar and we give this dollar to a healthy bank or gave that same dollar to a failing bank, the healthy bank is in a much better position to turn around and make new loans. And that is exactly why we focused on healthy banks for the Capital Purchase Program, because they are the ones who are in the best position in this time of economic disruption to step up and make new loans to their businesses and their consumers in their communities. That is exactly right.",Speech,
"Mr. Neugebauer","Last question then, as a follow-up on that. Do you have evidence that this capital injection has, in fact, led to increased lending activity? Have you monitored that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We are in the process of working with the regulators to monitor that. As I indicated in my opening statement, there are indicators of the credit crisis softening, some confidence returning. It is going to take time. Think of it this way: Remember the economic stimulus checks that Americans got? If a homeowner or a person was nervous about their economic situation, and they got that check, they would be more likely to put it in the bank than to go out and spend it. And so we need to see confidence return to the system to really see the lending take off, and we need to get all the capital in the system. It is not going to happen as fast as any of us would like, but it is going to happen much faster for us having taken this action than if we hadn't.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentlelady from New York, Mrs. Maloney?",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Thank you. And I would like to welcome and thank both panelists for their government service and their testimony today. I would like to ask Mr. Dodaro about the report that you just issued on the program and where we are going and what has happened. Along with several Members of Congress--and I would like to place in the record this letter--we sent a letter to you and to Secretary Paulson asking if you had the technological capacity to provide real-time data, transparency on transactions by the entities receiving the TARP moneys, so that we can be sure that the moneys are used for the purposes that they were intended, not only to stabilize our markets but to provide credit to Americans. We are hearing some stories that this money is being used for overseas purchases. We want to make sure this money is not for private gain, but is consistent with the purposes of the Act. I would like you to comment on the recommendations that your report made. And is Treasury accepting your recommendations? Are we moving toward a systemic system with regulators so that we can track if the money is used for the purpose it was intended?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Our first recommendation in the report was to Treasury to work with the regulators. And, as Mr. Kashkari mentioned, some of the regulators are right in the institutions, and some of the larger ones on a regular basis. Others have a lot of knowledge, obviously, about the institutions that they regulate. So we think it is good. You need a systematic process for doing that, and it has to be more timely. Right now the regulators get information on a quarterly basis, usually called data quarterly financial statements, but that could be modified for a certain amount of the information. Now, that is, though, the one recommendation that we made that Treasury had a different interpretation on it. And I think it is important for them to reconsider collecting this information at an individual institution level. It is not micromanaging to ask people what they did with what you gave them, to the extent that it is possible. And I think it is very important, and it is the only way that we will have transparency.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","I agree completely and I intend to legislate that recommendation to make it clear to Treasury that we want transparency and accountability. I would like to ask Mr. Kashkari--I am grateful that the financial system of America did not collapse and that we are moving toward stability of our financial institutions. That was a goal, and we have achieved that, and we are getting stronger every day. But what I am hearing from my constituents is that the next step of getting credit out in the community is not happening. We have put $7.8 trillion into the financial system--10 times the $700 billion of the TARP program. Yesterday, there were 10 car dealers in my office from New York State. They say people want to buy from them, they want to buy their cars, but they cannot get a loan from a bank. We are hearing from constituents who would like to buy houses, but they don't know where to go to get a loan. The money is not getting out into the community. And I would venture that we should look more at what is happening to the money now, as opposed to putting it into the system. I have received numerous phone calls in support of a proposal of Treasury of a 4.5 percent program that would allow for people to buy their first homes. I think what is lacking here is there is not a clarify of programs to the people of where they can go for help. This, I believe, got such a groundswell of support because it was clear: You can go to Treasury, you can get a 4.5 percent, 30- year loan. And economists tell us that key to solving our challenge is helping people stay in their homes and getting the homebuilding, the home purchasing, this segment of our society moving. I want to underscore what many members on this panel have said, that we support moneys going to help people stay in their homes for long-term loans. And if Treasury has an objection to Commissioner Sheila Bair's program, if you feel you can streamline it, you can make it more effective, then do it. But that certainly is a goal. Numerous economists have told us we will not solve this problem --meaning the overall economy--until we stabilize the foreclosures, the 2 million to 5 million foreclosures that are predicted by some economists. But also a factor is the 4.5 percent program to get the economy moving. And I would like to know, are you moving forward with this program? I certainly support it. What is the status of it? And any program that you have that will get lending out to the community.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Congresswoman. Let me answer by starting with we look at the foreclosure problem as a critically important problem and issue that we are working hard on that is distinct but related to getting housing going again. And so the mortgage program that you referred to we put in the latter category. It is a housing program to help the housing market more broadly. We are looking at a variety of programs there. This is one thing we are looking at very seriously, trying to work out the details to understand exactly how to do it and implement it. But I agree with you, reducing interest rates to get borrowers off the sidelines so they can afford to buy a home for the first time or to afford a bigger home, it is the only thing that is going to help home prices, so we think it has some merit. On the foreclosure side, again, as I mentioned to Ms. Waters, we, again, continue to do a lot of work. We are in consultation with the transition team. Ultimately, programs that we implement, they are going to be the ones living with and executing, so we want to make sure that there is coordination there. So we are doing a lot of work on both fronts. And I agree with you in terms of the merit of both. In terms of consumer credit more broadly and auto loans and auto dealerships, we have heard the exact same thing. If you look at the cost of an auto loan today compared to a year or 2 years ago, it is remarkable. I mean, who would pay 14 percent to go buy a car today? That is exactly why we worked with the Federal Reserve to design this new consumer credit securitization facility. That should help bring the cost of consumer finance down right directly to our consumers--to our homeowners, to our car buyers, to our students who want to go to school, etc.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","My time has expired. Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","I thank the gentlelady from New York. There has been a request on her part for submission.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","If there is no objection, it is so ordered.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","I also have two letters, one from Mr. Keating from the ACLI, and one from Mr. Racicot from the American Insurance Association. If there is no objection, we will admit the same into the record. The Chair hears none, so they are admitted. And now, we will have Mr. Castle of Delaware.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Dodaro, back in my opening statement, I mentioned what I would like to ask you questions about, and that is the role of the lending by the Federal Reserve and what is being done with respect to overseeing what they have actually been doing. Their loans, actually, are at a rate much higher than anything the Treasury has done. It is close to a trillion dollars. I am looking at their balance sheet now, which is a very odd balance sheet, because assets become liabilities and vice versa. But it is approximately in that range. And I am interested in more oversight and greater detail concerning their expenditures and what they are doing, all of which is pursuant to section 13-3 of the Act allowing these loans. I realize when I say all this that the Federal Reserve has, by legislation and by fiat in general, certain protections with respect to the kinds of lending which they are doing to banks for reasons of security. But, to me, these kinds of loans aren't that dissimilar from what is happening in Treasury. And when we deal with these section 13-3 loans, we are dealing with something of which there should be more transparency and, I think, more knowledge with respect to what is happening. I would just like to get your views on it, since you are the ones who are really overseeing what Treasury is doing. And I realize there is nothing you can do now because of the confidentiality aspects of the Federal Reserve, but should we be doing something as legislators to make sure that transparency is increased?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","There is no question, Congressman, that the Fed's activities, you know, in terms of volume and the amount of money, you know, it far exceeds the TARP program activities. The Federal Reserve has certain protections to statutorily protect its independence. Part of that is that it is one of the few areas in the Federal Government where there are prohibitions against GAO oversight for activities regarding foreign currency transactions, transactions with foreign banks, with open market transactions, and also with the discount window. So there are limitations on our ability to provide this type of oversight. There have been legislative proposals in the past to give GAO additional statutory authority to provide greater oversight over some of these activities that would be taking place. My view would be that a carefully crafted legislative solution would be necessary for GAO to have more ability to oversee those type of transactions while also providing and safeguarding the confidentiality necessary to do that. We have a long history of protecting information of a classified status in the national security area and others and have an unblemished record, so I think we have the ability to do this. But, in my opinion, it would require a statutory change.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","Oh, I agree with that. I guess my question really is, is it something you would welcome? Is it something that would be helpful, in terms of the broader picture of all these loans which are being made and the return to stability that we are all concerned about?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","My philosophy on this is that we exist at the GAO to support the Congress in carrying out its constitutional responsibilities. And if the Congress believes that it is necessary, we would be happy to work with you to craft the type of legislative proposal that would provide that type of oversight and assistance to the Congress.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","And let me just restate, of course, that I am just talking about those loans which are being made pursuant to these emergency circumstances as opposed to their normal bank lending, which I think takes on a different tone all together.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","I understand that, Congressman, and I agree with that. And that is what I was speaking about also.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","Okay. Mr. Kashkari, quickly, are you or the regulators who deal with--let's see, there are 87 loans, as you have indicated-- following what the banks have actually done after they have gotten the money? We are all concerned about, is this getting out to Main Street in some way or another. And is that being done? I realize the representations they made, I realize that you are worrying about securing them as far as their capital is concerned. But we are somewhat concerned about what are they actually doing. Are they doing what they represented they would do, and are they actually making sure that, pursuant to what you said here today, it is in their best interest to have these loans go out and to become economically strong again. Is that actually being pursued to make sure that is happening as a part of these reports which we are getting and going to get?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, we are working on that very issue with the regulators. We had a call just a day or so ago with the four banking regulators to look at their supervisory data that they can get to monitor on an individual basis and on an aggregate basis what is happening with the banks that have received the funds versus the banks that haven't received the funds. So that program is being designed and put into place. It is not going to be perfect. And, as you know, you put a dollar into an institution, it is impossible to follow where that dollar goes. You know, you have to look at it in the aggregate. And so we are looking at market-wide measures, as well as working with the regulators to look at institutional measures, as well. And we are not there yet, but we are working on it.",Speech,
"Mr. Castle","Okay. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Castle. And now we will hear from the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. Watt.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Welcome, Mr. Kashkari. I am looking, in front of me, at a sequence of events here. On October 6th, at 12:30 p.m., the Treasury Department announced procurement authorities and procedures, in which they were talking about purchasing whole assets and whole loans and the whole process of things; they outline the procedures. At 1:45 that same day, they announced that you were being hired as the Interim Assistant Secretary for Financial Stability. On October 13th, you gave a speech to the Institute of International Bankers, in which you were still talking about purchasing troubled assets, ``mortgage-backed securities purchase program: This team is identifying which troubled assets to purchase, from whom to buy them, and which purchase mechanism will best meet our policy objectives. We are designing a detail auction protocol,'' so forth and so on. On October 13th, at 2:27 p.m., it was announced that a firm, Ennis Knupp & Associates, had been hired. And in that announcement, ``The investment advisor will conduct research on mortgage whole loan asset managers and on servicing organizations. Firm will identify qualified minority- and women-owned businesses to provide services for the portfolios.'' A contract of $2,495,190 was announced on that occasion. My questions to you: How much has Ennis Knupp been paid, and what have they done?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Congressman. Ennis Knupp is our consultant--",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","I know who they are. Tell me how much they have they been paid and what they have done.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I don't have the dollar value for how many dollars have gone out the door, but I can get it for you. They are advising us right now. We have received hundreds of applications for equity asset managers for all the equity investments we have made. They are helping us screen through those applications, identifying small, minority- and women- owned equity asset managers. And so, although we hired them to be our asset manager selection consultant, we thought we would be selecting asset managers for mortgages and mortgage-backed securities, we are using the same firm to help select the equity asset managers. Congressman, we have hired no firm for the asset managers, mortgage-backed securities, or mortgages. We never hired anybody. And so there is no one that we have hired who is just sitting around doing nothing because we changed strategies. We made sure that didn't happen.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","But when you put out the request for a proposal, it was to deal with the purchase of distressed assets. Did you put out another request for a proposal and give other applicants the opportunity to compete for that or you just decided this firm is the firm because they had some formal connection to Goldman Sachs and--I mean, that is what the public is asking us, Mr. Kashkari. This looks like a Goldman Sachs monopoly. And when you have all of these people who have these connections to Goldman Sachs in the chain, it makes all of us look bad, including yourself, mind you. I can't tell you the number of people who have questioned your credentials, as well as they are, because of your former connections to Goldman Sachs. Do you see what I am saying? And here are Ennis Knupp principals having connections to Goldman Sachs--people are asking me, is Goldman Sachs running this country? What are we doing? We have given $700 billion, and there is this monopoly on who is controlling it. Nobody is accounting to anybody for it. And the perception, whether the reality is correct or not, the perception is that there is something sinister going on here. So I want you to send to me, if you would, a detailed description of what has been paid to this firm and what they have done, because none of the people who have submitted applications to manage any of these assets have heard anything from Ennis Knupp. There are 100-and-some applicants out there that Representative Waters and I have been trying to get in the door to help with this process, and they can't get in the door because you all keep changing the rules about what it is they are supposed to do, and Knupp is not doing anything to process their applications. I yield back, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Mr. Chairman, may I respond?",Speech,
"The Chairman","Briefly, Mr. Kashkari, yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We have a very formal procurement process, led by career staff at the Treasury. Let me segment it in three categories. Mortgage asset managers, we put out solicitations, received applications, hired nobody. Investment manager consultant, that is Ennis Knupp. They are not making any decisions. They are just advising the career Treasury staff. And we have received hundreds of applications for equity asset managers. Our career staff is reviewing those, with advice from Ennis Knupp, has down selected, are right now in the process of negotiating conflicts of interest to make sure taxpayers are fully protected. I am very proud of the procurement process that we have established very quickly, led by the most senior career professionals at Treasury.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Let me just say this as gently as I can: All these billions of dollars are out there doing something, and you are telling me that nobody has been hired to do any of the management of what they are doing. That is not adding up for me, Mr. Kashkari, I am sorry. And it is not adding up for the public. I mean, I am not a conspiracy theorist here, but I wouldn't come and make these accusations or even ask the questions if people were not asking me. The gentleman who ended up being the CEO at Wachovia was from Goldman Sachs. And people on the ground in my community are saying, what is up here? Is Goldman Sachs running the country or is Congress running the country? Is this Administration running the country? It looks bad, Mr. Kashkari. That is the problem we have.",Speech,
"The Chairman","The gentlewoman from Illinois.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And thank you, Mr. Dodaro, for your, I think, very thorough report. I really appreciate it. My question is for Mr. Kashkari. The deadline for submitting insurance proposals has passed. I think that was October 28th. Did you receive a large number of responses on the request? And can we expect to hear more from Treasury regarding the insurance program?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, Congresswoman, we received, I believe, close to 100 responses, which we have gone through very carefully. And actually, the recent Citigroup investment that we made, in coordinated action with the Federal Reserve and the FDIC, the Treasury provided--the TARP provided $5 billion of insurance against mortgage-related assets. That is the first exercise of our authority under Section 102 of the Troubled Asset Relief Plan.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Well, you know, I applaud the exercise of authorities other than the capital injection. But I wonder why the government didn't implement a program where it is the insurer of first resort, and not secondary.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Forgive me, I don't follow you.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Well, for example, under the Aon plan the Treasury Department could implement a program allowing holders of illiquid assets to form an asset stabilization pool so that those entities are the first resort, while in the Citi, isn't it that the government is the--",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","No, actually Congresswoman, Citigroup in that program is taking the first loss position, followed by TARP and the FDIC and then the Federal Reserve.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Yes, but for a very limited amount.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I don't have the number. I believe it is close to $40 billion, $30- or $40 billion is the Citigroup's first loss position.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Could you get that to me?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Absolutely. I would be happy to.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Thank you. Have you reviewed the Aon proposal to develop an insurance solution to deal with the illiquidity of mortgage-backed assets?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I personally have not, but we have a team that studied all of the proposals, all close to a hundred, and I am almost certain that that proposal came in through the formal channels. And all of those were reviewed very carefully.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Well, that proposal was really the same as the language that we put into the bill. Isn't that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, Congresswoman, I am not sure. I can find out, though.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Okay. Well, what plans does the Treasury have for addressing then the undervalued mark-to-market assets, which really do drag down the balance sheets of the financial institutions?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","The mark-to-market is a very important issue. We are focused on stabilizing the financial system so that they can recognize their losses and also raise additional capital and get lending going in our community again. We believe that both by helping the consumers directly; for example, through our facility with the Federal Reserve that I have spoken about, and putting more capital in the banks, it puts them in a better position so that we can weather this downturn and get these assets moving again. So there is no one tool. All of the regulators are bringing the various tools to bear in a complementary manner to try to get through the financial crisis. The TARP is very important, but it complements the other tools that we have.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Well, you said that you are monitoring, and there are indicators that include: One, that the financial system hasn't collapsed; two, that the credit default swap spread for the 8 largest U.S. banks has declined more than 200 points; and three, that the LIBOR and OIS spreads have declined 100 basis points, but when will we hear a more concrete description just about what the institutions are doing with the funds that they are receiving?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, that is something we are working on right now with the regulators. As you know, the four banking regulators, the Fed, FDIC, OCC, and Treasury are the supervisors of these banks.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Can you give us a date?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I can't give you a specific date aside from saying as we speak right now, just yesterday we spoke about it, we are working with the regulators to collect this information on a regular basis, taking very seriously the feedback provided by the GAO and the Congress.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Do we have to mandate that if you can't give us some timeline? Everybody, I think, has asked this, when are we going--",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, it will probably be weeks before we are going to start seeing the initial data. They collect this data right now I believe quarterly, the call report data. We are working with the regulators to figure out which are the right metrics that are going to get at the fundamental questions that people are asking. I don't want to overcommit here, but it is something that we are taking very, very seriously.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","I yield back.",Speech,
"The Chairman","I recognize myself for 5 minutes. First, before my 5 minutes starts, I apologize, but I have been working on the question of the automobile industry, and I will be leaving shortly to go testify before the Rules Committee. So the chairman of the Financial Institutions Subcommittee will continue the very good job he is doing of presiding. I also want to respond, I received a letter apparently today, if today is December 10th, from--the lead signature is the minority leader, Mr. Boehner, and some others, asking me to immediately summon CEOs from institutions that have received TARP funds before the committee. Now, we do have a week before we can have a hearing, so this is apparently a request for a hearing sometime next week. I will consider it and consult with the members. I will say this: If it is not likely to be the case that the second $350 billion is requested until January, then I think this is something we can accommodate. I will say that I know people don't always think of things instantly, the banks in question have had TARP funds for some time. Apparently someone woke up yesterday and thought it would be a good idea to have a hearing right away, today being December 10th. I think it will be hard logistically to accommodate that next week, but I agree in the substance. And I would say this, my assumption is that we will be able to have such a hearing with some of the CEOs, obviously not all of them. There are, I don't know, several dozen I would guess who have gotten funds under the TARP are banks, but we will call in a representative sample, including different sizes, and have such a hearing. At some point, there will be a request to trigger the second $350 billion. We will have 15 days to vote on that. My intention now would be to have that hearing sometime during this period. So I will not, I think, be able to comply with the request that I do it immediately. I am not sure that the request that I do it immediately was done with any expectation that I would do it immediately. But yes, I do think it is appropriate to have such a hearing.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Will the gentleman yield?",Speech,
"The Chairman","Yes.",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","As a signatory of that letter, I appreciate you taking such a prompt look at it. And I appreciate you considering holding a hearing when it--",Speech,
"The Chairman","And if we did it on that timetable, does the gentlewoman think that would be compliant?",Speech,
"Mrs. Biggert","Well, ``immediately'' is a term that people have different ideas about, but I think that timetable would work.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Okay. As long as it is clear that by immediately, we don't mean immediately, then we will be able to do it.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Mr. Chairman, would the chairman yield for a moment?",Speech,
"The Chairman","To whom?",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","To me.",Speech,
"The Chairman","The gentleman from Georgia, yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me just encourage you to move ahead with all deliberate speed to get these CEOs before our committee. There are pertinent questions that we have to ask and get that answer as to why they are not lending.",Speech,
"The Chairman","That is why I said that we would do it.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Let me say that the deliberate speed I will employ will be a lot quicker than the deliberate speed which the gentleman is well aware of is not the fastest moment in our history when we segregated for much longer.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Amen.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","Mr. Chairman?",Speech,
"The Chairman","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","One question: I know under the original TARP bill that it is a joint resolution of disapproval that we would have to pass. So is there any fear that there might be some--",Speech,
"The Chairman","I have no expectation--let me say this, and I have had some business with the Secretary of the Treasury and we have discussed this. It is conceivable that we could have a request for $350 billion. I will tell you this: If it came, I know that the Speaker and the Majority Leader would reconvene our bodies, as inconvenient as that might be. I think it is likely at this point, absent a lot of work on foreclosures and other things, that such a resolution of disapproval could pass. Yes, it could be vetoed. Given the extent to which the psychology of the investor community is a large part of our problem, and I have spoken to people in the Administration, I don't think anyone thinks that releasing the second $350 billion as a result of the President vetoing a resolution of disapproval would not in fact be doing more harm than good. So I am confident there will be conversations. I think people are behaving responsibly here. There were conversations between the outgoing Administration, the incoming Administration, and the leadership. And my own advice is that I think ultimately we should have that $350 billion, but after there has been a lot of conversation about how it would be used. And I don't think it would be in anybody's interest to force that issue before there is a consensus on that. I am reasonably confident of that.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","Okay. Great. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Mr. Secretary, I apologize for having been in and out. One of the things that, as you know, raised my concern was the GAO's recommendation that you do a better job of trying to see whether or not the banks in question were relending the money that they were lending. Let me say my 5 minutes should just be starting now in terms of the questions. And I know we had a conversation, and I appreciated your responsiveness, and you may have touched upon this in your statement, I believe that the response you put in writing was so worded as to suggest that you weren't going to try to do that, and I was afraid that would give a signal to some of the banks that they wouldn't have to worry so much. And I understand we had that regulator's statement of November 12th, which was useful. The anecdotal evidence is still overwhelming that there are people who think they are good borrowers who can't get loans. I know there is some problem with where the loans could be. So I guess I would ask you to clarify what is the state now of this? Are you going to be measuring in some near term whether the banks that got the money have relended? I understand that money is fungible, but total loan amounts are also countable, so that there should be some way to do that. What is the current state of your view? And the answer to that I think whether or not there is a successful request for a drawdown of the second $350 billion is dependent, in my judgment, in part on mortgage foreclosure, some of the relief going forward, including the 4.5 percent or some variant of it, and the consumer matters. I will say to people who have been concerned about auto dealers that relief for the auto dealers is going to come ultimately from the TARP, but that also showing that there is some way of counting how we are doing that. And I ask you to comment and then Mr. Dodaro to comment on your comment, please.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. We are working very hard with the four banking agencies to look at the supervisory data they collect and to understand if that will get at an answer to the fundamental questions that you and other members are asking and that the GAO is asking. So we are working right now with the four banking agencies to look at the quarterly reports that they collect, does that shed light on this issue? If not, what other data do we need? And how frequently can we collect it? So we have heard the feedback, we got it, and we are working on it.",Speech,
"The Chairman","Mr. Dodaro, let me ask you to comment, but first let me take some credit of there is a credit scarcity in this country, one of money to lend, and two, for anything we do. We never get any credit. So I want to give us some. One of the criticisms made of the bill was it didn't have adequate oversight. Now, there was a slowdown in the creation of the congressional panel. My guess is some who were complaining that there was too little oversight, now that we have that congressional panel will be heard to complain that there is too much of it. I myself welcome it. But we did write--and we still have a pending confirmation in the Senate of an Inspector General. But we knew that the GAO was there, we know--there are few institutions around here that are as respected across the ideological and political spectrum as the GAO. And we were very pleased, as you know, Mr. Dodaro, we met with you early. You reported to us that with the cooperation of Secretary Paulson and Mr. Kashkari you were on the ground as soon as this startup was there. You had people there. And the very fact that we are here talking about a report which gives them some credit and some criticism I think testifies to the adequacy at the very least of the oversight parts of the bill. But would you now comment on Mr. Kashkari's--are you in on these discussions? Do you have some confidence about them going forward?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","We have had some preliminary conversations, the staff on the team, with Mr. Kashkari and his team. But we need to stay involved to see what they come up with in their proposal that they are going to work with the regulators on. I think they are now headed in the right direction, but you know, I would like to see the specifics about what data, how frequently they are going to do it. We will stay involved, give them our feedback to ensure that recommendation--",Speech,
"The Chairman","I appreciate that. Let me just say this, given the jurisdictions around here, if there is a request for the second $350 billion, whether it comes early in January as a joint proposal from the two Administrations or it comes later, I would like to be in a position to defend the $350 billion, not to oppose efforts to cut it off. My ability to give a good answer to this question that we are now talking about, are we effectively measuring relending, that will be critical to my getting the bill through. I think the extent to which I and the Speaker and a few others can get major legislation through entirely on our charm has run out. So we are going to need some very hard answers. The gentlewoman from Florida is overreacting to that, I might say. But we will try to get some hard answers. I thank you. And the gentleman from Pennsylvania will resume the Chair.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hensarling.",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kashkari, in your testimony you speak, I think in the first paragraph, about the critical objectives that Treasury has undertaken under the EESA statute. By my reading, it appears that Treasury has nine different factors it must take into consideration in operating the TARP program, including protecting the interests of the taxpayers, maximizing overall returns, minimizing the impact of the national debt, stabilizing our financial markets, helping families keep their homes, stabilizing communities, and ensuring that all financial institutions are eligible. In your interpretation of the statute, did you get direction from Congress on how to weigh these various considerations? And do you consider some of them to be competing interests in the short term?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I think that all of those considerations are important. I think some of them can be competing. And it can be difficult to prioritize, especially in a time of financial crisis. As an example, we absolutely want to protect the taxpayer, but we first and foremost want to prevent the financial system from collapsing. That was our highest priority. Once we were able to do that, we want to do that in a manner that provides as much protection to the taxpayer as possible. Also keep in mind what would happen to the taxpayers if the financial system had been allowed to collapse. So these are very complex and important considerations, and I will just tell you our highest priority was to get out there and move aggressively to stabilize the financial system.",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Kashkari, I have a great preference for the use of voluntary capital from investors over the involuntary capital of taxpayers. I believe that one man's nimble response to the economic crisis may be another man's confused ad hoc approach. It is anecdotal, but I have heard from many investors that frankly they have been less than confident in the actions of the Treasury, that their capital is sitting on the sideline, that there are homeowners who have the ability to pay their mortgages or to work with lenders, but are unwilling to do it at this time, thinking they may get a better deal from Treasury, or a better deal from Chairman Bair of the FDIC. My question is in bringing stability, at what point is certainty, legislative and regulatory certainty, needed in the marketplace? I mean some of what we are facing is psychological, I believe, in nature. And in fact Chairman Frank, I see he is no longer in the chair, has stated, ``the psychological problem is even worse than the real problem.'' But at least the anecdotal evidence is very strong that by careening seemingly from one strategy to another, frankly you have done more to incite panic in the markets as opposed to calming them.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, there is no question that clarity and certainty are very important for developing market confidence. We have had to move and be nimble and react to changes on the ground. I say since the beginning of the credit crisis, the one constant has been its unpredictability. And it has only intensified and deepened more rapidly than we had expected, even in the few weeks that we were working with the Congress on this legislation. So I think we have a choice of being on our back foot and seeing what happens, potentially risking a financial collapse, or being on our front foot and being aggressive to try to stabilize the system, prevent a collapse, and then let the system heal. But I agree with you that more clarity will help with confidence, and will help the system to heal faster. And we think we have the right strategy.",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","Mr. Dodaro, not a question but a comment, I read every word of your report. It was excellent. It was very helpful to the process. In the remaining seconds I may have available, Mr. Kashkari, I am still somewhat confused about the point. I want there to be clarity. For institutions requesting funds under CPP, is it the policy of Treasury to allow the regulator of the financial institution in question to determine viability? And is that the only criteria that Treasury is employing at this time for access to those funds?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","The regulator--we are looking at viability. That is our test. And the regulator offers us their assessment of the institution's viability without government assistance. Ultimately, Treasury makes the decision. So in some cases the regulator will submit an application and recommend a ``yes.'' We may look at it and say, gee, we are not so sure. We will send the application back to the four banking regulators so they can review it, a peer review process, and come to us with a combined regulation. The point is that we don't want to put government capital into a bank that is ultimately going to fail. We don't think that is protecting the taxpayers. And so there are some unhealthy banks that are out there, and the regulators are in the best position to offer us information and their judgment on who is healthy and who is not.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you. Now the gentleman from New York,",Speech,
"Mr. Meeks","",Speech,
"Mr. Meeks","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I am still waiting to hear really some answers, especially in regards to some of the questions that Ms. Waters asked. I am concerned with reference to just the response to Mrs. Maloney when--and I agree that lowering interest rates, you know, may be a good thing in trying to get individuals back into buying homes, etc. However, the number of individuals who can get back into the market because of the lack of availability of credit and the fact that you have to have the super high scores to be eligible shows that the number of individuals who are going to buy homes is not going to be great in comparison to the number of individuals who continue to lose their homes. And thereby, you know, it seems to me to make sense if in fact we figure out how we are going to help those individuals to prevent them from losing their homes so that we can make sure that we are starting to stabilize this market. And in the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that we passed, we put in there specific words that the Secretary had the authority to use loan guarantees and credit enhancements to facilitate these loan modifications to prevent affordable foreclosures. But it seems that the Secretary has not moved. Whether it is the program that was put out there by Mr. Johnson or Chairwoman Bair, the Secretary has not moved to do anything, or at least it appears to us to do anything to make a difference in helping those individuals or preventing individuals from going into foreclosure. So my first question is, is the Treasury looking to do anything with reference to what he has the authority to do to stop the rising tide of foreclosures that are imperiling the economy that we are currently suffering from?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Congressman. The answer is yes, absolutely. And I am going to give you, if you will permit me, a two-part answer. First, we continue to work very hard looking at the various proposals that we have received and that we have developed ourselves working with the Federal Reserve, also consulting with the transition team to identify the right approach that is going to help homeowners without creating a windfall to hedge fund investors. We want to balance it so that the homeowners are getting the benefit, not the investors, number one. Number two, we are trying to bring all of the tools in the Federal Government to bear on this problem. And so, for example, the work that we did with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac by establishing a streamlined loan modification protocol for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the advantage of that, Congressman, is that most of the agreements that govern the subprime loans out there refer back to the Fannie and Freddie underwriting-- excuse me, the Fannie and Freddie servicing standards. So by using Fannie and Freddie, we have been able, with their regulator, FHFA, to establish effectively a new industry-wide standard for loan modifications. So we are looking at what we can do under the TARP, but we are also looking at what other tools we have outside the TARP. We want to bring all of the tools to bear and use the right tool for the right job.",Speech,
"Mr. Meeks","Except it seems as though there is none--because we are talking about a small percentage of the TARP money that would be utilized in regards to trying to make sure that the mortgagors--that would prevent the foreclosures of these mortgages. And when you look at the number of individuals, I think it is 70 percent of subprime borrowers are not getting the help, that there are not enough servicers. And unless we start putting some money into training and having more servicers for these loans so that we can help save some more individuals from going into foreclosure, then we will never get from under this mortgage foreclosure problem, which seems to be the epicenter of all of the problems that we are having here. And then, let me ask this question also, because I think it goes to something of the perception, continuing the perception that Mr. Watt talked about. Because I am also concerned that in recent weeks the Federal Reserve has approved expedited bank holding company applications for numerous companies, including Goldman Sachs, and I think Morgan Stanley, and the Treasury Department has already awarded TARP money under the Capital Purchase Program to Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley, and that these companies are also issuing billions of dollars of federally guaranteed debt under the FDIC's debt guarantee program, designed specifically for banks and bank holding companies. In light of these circumstances, what I want to find out is what safeguards is the Treasury Department establishing to ensure that taxpayer money under the TARP program and the FDIC programs and the Federal Reserve discount window is not being used to support the substantial nonbank commercial activities of any of these newly formed bank holding companies?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, by becoming bank holding companies, these various entities are coming under increased regulatory supervision. So the Federal Reserve will now be their regulator, perhaps the OCC. They are going to now have Federal regulators in their offices on the ground with them supervising their activity, making sure they are not putting the taxpayers at undue risk. So the Federal regulators are in the best position to do that. They are now onsite doing that.",Speech,
"Mr. Meeks","But see--just one follow up--because there are bank holding companies that also own commercial businesses such as travel agency businesses. And what I don't see, and I am trying to find out what safeguards are in place to prevent TARP money from going to say the travel agency that happens to be owned by a diversified company? And just because it became a bank holding company? Because we had that same kind of situation when we talk about even when we are dealing with the auto industry, that they don't qualify under TARP. But I don't understand what we are doing here in that regards--",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is very difficult--",Speech,
"Mr. Meeks","--as far as protections are concerned.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is very difficult, Congressman, to ring fence money in an organization and say, well, this money stays here and that money stays there. If we gave money to one part of the organization, that would mean they would have to take less money from the other part of the organization in. So this is something that we are looking at, but it is very difficult to try to say this money needs to stay in this little part of the organization. I haven't heard a good idea how to do that.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Maybe a good idea would be to separate the institutions. Maybe we ought to revisit that question. Thank you, Mr. Meeks. The gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Garrett.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Thank you. Thank you for your hard work and your dedication to this issue. Let me begin with a question that I hear from my district all the time. You sort of touched on it, and I think the answer is probably an easy ``no.'' When you said to one of the other questions how many foreclosures would have occurred had we not done this, and of course you have heard other people say before the bill came along if you don't do it the credit market will crash, and so on and so forth. We did pass the bill, obviously the market still crashed, and what have you. It seemed things didn't really begin to get a little bit of an uptick until you saw the globalization coordinated effort. So the short question is, is there any way to measure what would have occurred had we not taken the passage of this bill?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is very difficult to measure the counterfactual, as the chairman started with.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Yes. Okay. That is what I thought. To the gentleman behind me, he raised the good question I thought with regard to what some of the goals are here, and is it an economic one or is it towards market driven? I appreciate your answer there. To the extent that it is not simply to get the market, the stock market up again and the market going in the right direction again, but larger global or larger economic issues and what have you, one of the questions I have is at what level? The number I read the other day was, for example, that household debt to income is down for 2 quarters straight now from a high of 139 percent down to I don't know what the current number is. Now, in one sense, that is bad for the economy when going forward. But in the other sense, if we can get back to a reasonable level on that, that may be a good thing. As the gentleman behind me always asks, what do you have against poor people in the sense that they are the ones who want to be able to buy into these houses, and what we are trying to do with a number of these initiatives is to keep the price inflated. So in a nutshell, how do you address that question as to what level?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is a great question. Clearly, we don't want our consumers to be overlevered. And coming back to a more normal savings rate is an appropriate process. I think the challenge for policymakers and for legislators is we don't want that correction to happen too quickly, where it becomes destructive to the economy as a whole and we suffer grave economic consequences. So having a gradual, orderly transition to that new level probably makes sense. It is hard for me to opine on what the right level is. The other comment, Congressman, I would make is we want to be careful to avoid an overcorrection, either an overcorrection in house prices or an overcorrection and excessive deleveraging of the system, because that will exacerbate our economic problems that result from that correction, even if much of the correction is necessary. And so a lot of the actions that we are looking at and that we are taking are to stabilize the system and to try to prevent an overshoot on the downside.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Some of the other economists or experts who speak on these things worry about we may go to that overcorrection because of some of the actions we are taking with regard to the valuation of the dollar, and although no one is talking about it today, down the road when you V-type approach as far as interest rates and inflation down the road, so you may see a spiking of the overcorrection occurring there. One of the other comments that you made was with regard to the goal initially, or always has been I think you said with regard to TARP was to get more capital back into the system. I have to tell you that wasn't always the impression that we got as it was selling. The cap phrase always was, how do we get these toxic assets off the books? And then, of course, we were talking about the reverse mortgage aspect. A lot of us were asking how is that going to work? Because if you don't hit the numbers exactly right, you may end up with those banks having too low. So I have to just share with you that it was not the presentation by the Administration that was the goal. It was just to get them off and to have lending occur there. And the capital aspect was a secondary issue, except for some members, as the ranking member was trying to raise those.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I understand your question. From our perspective, and if we didn't articulate it clearly I apologize, it has always been about capital. As the correction has taken its course, Secretary Paulson and Chairman Bernanke were aware that there may come a time when there would be not enough capital in the system, and the private markets would be unwilling to provide that capital. There are different ways you can get at the capital problem. Purchasing illiquid assets--",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Was one way.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","--was one way.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","And then this was a faster way.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","The last question is, can you just briefly talk about the TALF program and explain to me what actually are the assets that are actually backing them if you are talking about things like student loans or credit cards or even cars, car loans, which obviously are a depreciating asset in normal times, and are probably depreciating even more? But what is the actual asset that we are looking back to be able to reclaim if these things go bad?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","The assets will be--the details are being designed right now, but it is new securitizations of new credit card receivables.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","New auto loan securitizations, so the AAA pieces of new securitizations. The very high quality credit, low risk for the taxpayers, where right now some of the spreads have just completely blown out, and it is just completely unreasonable for someone to go buy a car today.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","So what is the backing on a credit card, a AAA credit card situation? What do you go after? What does the taxpayer go after, in essence, if that asset goes bad?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, ultimately, it is the credit cards, and ultimately it is the borrowers who owe on the credit cards, or on auto loans. Similarly, these are consumer credit vehicles to start with. But what the Federal Reserve and Treasury are focused on is these are historically very low credit risk. They are not being priced where they are today because of credit risk; they are being priced where they are today because of illiquidity in the system.",Speech,
"Mr. Garrett","I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Garrett. Now, Mr. Capuano of Massachusetts.",Speech,
"Mr. Capuano","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, first of all, thank you for being here. Mr. Dodaro, my question revolves around one item in your report. I want to make sure that I read this clearly. You have recommended that Mr. Kashkari's group monitor individual institutions in the use of their money. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","That is correct.",Speech,
"Mr. Capuano","And Mr. Kashkari, you have been reported as saying you oppose that position. Do you still oppose it?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, we do not oppose it. We are working with the banking regulators, who are collecting various data from these institutions, to look at the best way to do it. Our hesitation has been about our effectiveness, our ability to determine is it the Capital Purchase Program having the effect? Are there other policy programs having the effect? It has not been a lack of desire, it has been concern about our ability to isolate what is the effect, what is the cause, and is it really boiling down to the policy objectives?",Speech,
"Mr. Capuano","Well, in that case, I think you better clarify both to the GAO and to the independent Congressional Oversight Board, because they both report that you oppose it. Now, if you have changed your position or it wasn't clear, so be it. But I was under the impression that was what the GAO was supposed to be about, they make a recommendation, you tell how you feel about it. They reported clearly that you oppose it. They reported that the Federal Reserve opposes it. And the Congressional Oversight Board just today reported that you oppose it. And if you don't, that is good news. But if you do, or you hesitate to review the use of these moneys by individual institutions to see if they are fulfilling the requirements of the law and the intention of the Congress and the President in passing this law, I would strongly suggest that you couldn't be more wrong if your life depended on it, and you would be heading into very, very dangerous waters. I would personally think that it is a dereliction of duty to not look at individual uses. To give any bank, any institution $45 billion and not look at how they did it? I will tell you unequivocally I don't think you will find a single Member of Congress who would suggest, and I voted for the package, I don't regret it yet, but I would like to see a little bit more oversight on the individual institutions to see whether they are using the money individually. I understand you are looking at generic metrics, and I respect that, and I am willing to wait for that time, I understand that takes some time, I get all that. But it is not that hard to tell whether individual institutions are living up to their requirements and actually using this money to actually put money on the streets. Your own words in your own report, actually very clearly, I think very well, banks in turn have an obligation, an obligation, that is your words, not mine, to their communities to continue making credit available to creditworthy borrowers and to work with struggling borrowers to avoid preventable foreclosures. I couldn't agree with that statement more. That is a wonderful statement. But if you don't look at the individual banks and you don't look at them hard, you will never be able to fulfill that requirement. And I would just encourage you to do so. And again, if it is a miscommunication, I would strongly urge you to communicate more directly to the gentleman sitting next to you and also to the people at the Congressional Oversight Board.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Capuano","I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentlelady from Florida, Ms. Brown- Waite.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","Thank you very much. Mr. Dodaro, I appreciate the report that you put together. It is very helpful. Did you have access to the contracts that were given when the money was given to the 87 banks in the 30 States? Did you see those contracts?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","We have looked at all the individual contracts, once the decisions have been made, not only for the agreements that the banks have made--they are all signing, my understanding is, let me just correct that--make sure I am correct, but they are all signing a standard agreement for the 87 institutions. And we have looked at that standard agreement. We have also looked at the contracts that have been let to hire the financial agent, the one that has been hired, as well as the other contractors to support Treasury's administrative operation.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","Let me just clarify. So it is a boilerplate contract that the 87 banks, 87 financial institutions who received funds signed. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","That is correct.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","And in this boilerplate contract, was there specific language that said the purpose of this money-- and remember, it is taxpayer dollars--and I am just asking you, and then I am going to ask Mr. Kashkari--",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Right, right.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","--was the purpose there specifically so that the financial institutions would be helping consumers and helping to free up money in the marketplace?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, my understanding is the language in there, in the boilerplate languages, included in what is called the recitals there in the agreement that the money was to be used for purposes of the Act which would increase the flow of credit and also be used potentially to mitigate foreclosures.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","Did the contract at any point say, ``Use this money and go forth and purchase other financial institutions?''",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","No.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","Mr. Kashkari, you have a difficult job to do. You really and truly do. But you have to realize that we have a responsibility to the taxpayers. Right now I can tell you, and I think members, whether they voted for it or voted against it, are viewing the action that was taking place with the bailout as the great taxpayer train robbery. Because while you made a statement, and I wrote it down, you said that it did not--that the public is not considering the fact that you did not allow the financial system to collapse--am I correct that was your statement?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, it was not about the public, it was just a statement that we did not allow the financial system to collapse.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","But, sir, the economy is collapsing. When businesses do not--cannot have access to a line of credit that they have had with the same bank for over 20 years and become-- grow from a small business to a medium-sized business and employ lots of people, the economy, sir, I don't want to quote the quote that was used during one of the presidential campaigns, but it is the economy. And if the money is stagnantly being hoarded or used for these other purposes, we are going down a rat hole, sir. That is not what people who voted for it believed that they were getting. Individuals who called me encouraging me to vote originally for it, now that they know the details, are saying they were wrong. And when constituents and business people call you up and say they were wrong to try to encourage this Member of Congress to vote for it, you have to realize what the public thinks of the Treasury and of this Congress.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, thank you for the feedback. We take such feedback very seriously. And it is hard, the other Congressman to your right asked about the counterfactual and whether we could--Mr. Garrett--whether we could prove with evidence what would have happened had we not taken these actions. And it is very hard to demonstrate that to people. It is hard to demonstrate it--it is hard for economists to quantify it and show the effects. And so the actions that we are taking, all we can do is try to be as clear and transparent in the actions we are taking to try to communicate why we are taking the actions that we are taking, and to measure our results, and to make adjustments as we need to as we move forward.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","And let me also point out that Treasury notes, 4-week Treasury notes are now being sold at 0 percent. So it has a total effect on the economy, small businesses, and also the Treasury.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Absolutely. And if you will permit me, please, as I mentioned previously, this was a plan and is a program to stabilize the financial system so that credit can flow. It is not going to happen overnight or as fast as we would like. But that is different than an economic growth plan or an economic stimulus plan. And we do face real economic challenges.",Speech,
"Ms. Brown-Waite","I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","I thank the gentlelady from Florida. The gentleman from Texas, Mr. Hinojosa.",Speech,
"Mr. Hinojosa","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. My question is going to be to the honorable Secretary Kashkari. I voted in favor of this bill for many reasons. And I would like to focus on one, which was the calls that I got from the presidents of colleges and universities, chancellors and others who were saying that there was a lack of credit, and consequently banks that used to make college student loans were no longer making them. So I would like to know how Treasury's Term Asset-Backed Securities Loan Facility, which we will call TALF here, will help the not- for-profit secondary markets for student loans return to making and purchasing student loans. Treasury's plans seem to have focused solely on the for-profit sector, despite the fact that private student loan lenders have been the subject of investigation by State attorneys general. Tell me what the Treasury is going to do to help these lenders who have played a key role in the federally guaranteed student loan program, as well as have been providers for low-cost, consumer-friendly, non-Federal loans to fill the gaps between the cost of attendance and what is available through Federal financial aid?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Congressman. We too believe that the issue of making student loans available at a cost-effective rate for our students is absolutely vital for our country short term and long term. So the way the TALF is structured, and it is a Federal Reserve facility that the Treasury is investing in, it is structured, from my understanding, to help both the private and the nonprivate providers of student loan credit. It will help both. And it will provide liquidity to the markets to bring down student loan rates so that they are available on rates that students can afford just so they can go to college. Now, we have a team at Treasury that is working with a team at the Federal Reserve to design the details and get the program up and running. They have been receiving a lot of feedback from market participants in the student loan space and the auto space and the credit card space, etc., and are incorporating that feedback as they design the details. We want this program to help as many students as possible. Right now, it is being designed as a $200 billion program with $20 billion from Treasury, but it is designed to be scalable so we could expand it from there over time to make sure we are getting help to everybody who needs it.",Speech,
"Mr. Hinojosa","But you should know that this sector is huge; there was over $16 billion that was lent out in college loans. And to have banks not offering credit, not offering these student loans not only for the cars and for appliances and for many things that you have heard from my colleagues before me, these student loan programs are not working right now. And you need to know and have people report back to you on how it is not fixing the problem. I would like to ask Comptroller General Dodaro, the TALF program's aim was to increase credit availability for credit cards, auto loans, and student loans, as I mentioned. However, private lenders of the non-Federal student loans already enjoy Federal protections that auto and credit lenders do not, making it nearly impossible for student borrowers to discharge private student loans in bankruptcy. How will TALF program take into consideration these differences in the treatment of consumer debt?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Congressman, that is something that is under consideration by the Treasury Department, so a lot will depend on how they decide to move forward in those programs. I mean we are watching what they are doing, and as they institute programs, evaluating whether they are going to achieve the objectives or not. So it will depend on how that program will be designed going forward.",Speech,
"Mr. Hinojosa","Would Comptroller General Dodaro like to address my question? I am sorry, I meant to say Secretary Kashkari. Forgive me. I apologize.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","I am the one with the gray hair.",Speech,
"Mr. Hinojosa","There you go.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, the details, as I said, are being worked out right now, as the Comptroller General said. The only other comment I would make, sir, is that the program is being developed and it is going to take, you know, probably sometime in January before it is up and running. So again, none of these things can be turned on overnight. But we are getting a lot of positive market feedback from lenders of all types who are saying this is the right tool that they need to get credit flowing to our students and to our consumers.",Speech,
"Mr. Hinojosa","I yield back, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you. Mr. Barrett?",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Gentlemen, thank you are being here today. I was reading the legislation. The explicit intent is to immediately restore liquidity and stability in the financial system in the United States, and I believe that. That is why I voted for it. Are we, Mr. Kashkari, have we passed the point where our banking system, our financial system is catastrophe proof? Are we past that point?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I feel confident that the financial system is stronger than it was when the Congress acted so quickly. But this crisis has been unpredictable. And there have been times in the past when market participants breathed a sigh of relief and said, okay, we are through it. I don't want to make predictions, but I do say that it is important that we all stay on our front foot, and continue to move aggressively to take action to adjust to situations on the ground until we are sure we are through it. That is about as good an answer as I can give you, Congressman.",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","Well, that is an answer. I know it is tough. There seems to be a lot of fundamental inconsistencies between the claim the financial system was at risk because of toxic assets and the claims that the TARP go to healthy banks. I heard your answer, and I understand that. But looking in my district, and looking across America, it seems like the smaller banks are the healthier banks. They are the ones that are actually doing well right now. Is bigger better? Is giving TARP funds to these healthy banks that are in turn buying other banks and becoming mega banks, and it seems to me that that was part of the problem that some of these institutions were too big and didn't know what was going on, that seems a little counterproductive. Walk me through that.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Sure. That is a great question. Bigger is not necessarily better. And you are right, some of our smallest institutions are some of our healthiest. That is exactly why we want small banks to participate and to take the capital, because in many cases they are in the best position to extend new loans. Now to the topic of mergers and acquisitions, it is absolutely not our policy objective to encourage mergers or to consolidate the banking industry. Because as you said, bigger is not necessarily better.",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","Right.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","But if you have a bank that is weak or failing, and that bank is acquired by a healthy bank, that community is often better off, because now credit can still be extended, and branches will still stay open in that community, versus if that bank were allowed to fail and the bank would have to be shut down and dissolved, then that community would be worse off. So prudent mergers and acquisitions can be a healthy part of the financial system. We don't want to overdo it.",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","I agree with you 100 percent. I guess the key word is ``prudent.'' And as some of our banks have gotten larger, and I do agree, I think they are protecting some weak communities or some weak banks that in turn protect the community, how do we ensure that these bigger banks are using the prudent oversight so this doesn't manifest into the same thing on down the road?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is a very important issue. And I don't think there is a perfect brightline test that anybody can apply. But ultimately, each of these mergers and acquisitions needs to be approved by their primary Federal regulator, in many cases of both the target bank and the acquiring bank. And the regulators who are there onsite are in the best position to judge is this a prudent acquisition or is this a risky acquisition. Treasury, as you know, is not a bank regulator. But they don't have an easy job either.",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","Have we, Congress, in this legislation hamstrung you guys with specific mandates or specific directions we are telling you to go in that have decreased the program's effectiveness? I mean I know it seems like when Congress gets involved every time, you know, we try to mandate something, and too many times every time we do that we screw it up. Is that the case? If so, can you be specific?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Broadly speaking, I don't believe so. I think we worked very hard and constructively with the Congress to build in a lot of flexibility. It is interesting, sitting through those midnight negotiations sometimes what seemed like an obvious good idea at the time, when you actually go to implement it, it turns out to be a lot more complicated. We found those cases, but I this we also found ways of implementing the intent and the spirit of what was in the legislation in a manner that can be executed as quickly as we need. We are not done. There are things that we still have to do to follow up, to make sure banks are complying on a go- forward basis. So we are learning as we go, but we are making a lot of progress.",Speech,
"Mr. Barrett","Thank you, gentlemen. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much. We have a little bit of a problem. We are trying to accommodate Mr. Hensarling, who has a conflict meeting at 1:15, so at this time, we would ask the indulgence of Panel One to step aside, remain here of course, because we are going to recall you to continue examination. But we will ask Mr. Hensarling to make his presentation. At the table, or do you want to do it from there, Mr. Hensarling?",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","If it would help accommodate the panel and the committee, I am happy to issue the testimony here.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","We want to accommodate our friends on the other side of the aisle. Any way you wish to do it.",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","Why don't we allow our panelists to keep their seats, Mr. Chairman?",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Very good. You are recognized then to make your presentation, Mr. Hensarling.",Speech,
"Mr. Hensarling","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I appreciate the accommodation, since earlier we were scheduled for the first panel. So Mr. Chairman, Ranking Member Bachus, and fellow members of the committee, I want to thank you for inviting me to testify in this oversight hearing on the Troubled Asset Relief Program and to address the role of the Congressional Oversight Panel, after which I look forward to reclaiming again my role as inquisitor as opposed to inquisitee. Before I begin my testimony, I do want to recognize the work of the Congressional Oversight Panel Chairwoman, Elizabeth Warren. Faced with a number of challenges and time constraints not of her making, she was able to first, produce an initial report and, second, produce one that raises legitimate issues and questions for which Treasury must account, and about which this committee should care. Although I cannot in good conscience support the report at this time for reasons I will discuss later, I commend her nonetheless on her work. Mr. Chairman, it is clear that many Members of Congress are only now awaking to the fact that Congress has granted unprecedented discretionary powers to the Treasury Secretary, and has simultaneously created unprecedented taxpayer exposure. I, along with many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, supported alternative plans, and opposed the enactment of EESA. We were not, as one of my colleagues put it earlier today, bamboozled. I believe many of the criticisms that we are hearing today of Treasury are better directed at Congress for passing the misguided law in the first place. Be that as it may, EESA is now the law of the land, and I intend to do whatever I can to help ensure its success. In that regard, Mr. Chairman, I believe that effective oversight should have three main goals: One, ensure the program actually works. In other words, ensure that Treasury actually exercises its broad authority commensurate with the act, and that its actions are effective. Two, ensure the decision-making process is transparent and based on meritorious considerations of what helps the entire American economy, not an opaque political process picking winners and losers. Last, but certainly not least, ensuring that the often forgotten taxpayer is protected in this program. Even by Washington standards, $700 billion is a great deal of money. It translates into roughly $9,400 per American family, when they are struggling to keep their jobs, send their kids to college, and pay their mortgages. Mr. Chairman, they need the $9,400 paid back. First, we must again ask, is TARP working? After listening to the testimony, it is: (a) probably too early to tell; and (b), certainly most challenging to tell with respect to cause and effect. One, again, can argue in the short run that Congress has given Treasury a number of competing goals without guidance on how to weigh them. Furthermore, as we know, and as the panel's report has indicated, Treasury under EESA does not operate in a bailout vacuum. Treasury's efforts over EESA are dwarfed by the actions of the Fed. Since the inception of the financial crisis, the Fed has committed over $5 trillion through its facilities, windows, and other actions, compared to $335 billion for Treasury under TARP, a factor of roughly 15 to 1. Mr. Chairman, we in Congress will be negligent if we only focus upon Treasury and TARP and ignore the actions of the Federal Reserve. Second, with regard to transparency and the meritorious decision-making process, even after the testimony we have received, many questions remain: How will the activities of those participating in CPP be monitored; why AIG; why Citigroup; why are some Capital Purchase Program applicants encouraged to withdraw their applications? Finally, is the American taxpayer truly protected? We have an unprecedented level of Federal intervention, and every Treasury action will be paid for by congressionally mandated drawdown on future generations, compromising their freedom, their opportunity, and their standards of living. Mr. Chairman, I believe the Congressional Oversight Panel has a unique role to play in the accountability of EESA. Time will tell whether or not the panel will prove effective in that role. For a number of reasons, panelists were appointed late in the process, with a report looming large for submission today. Due to these and other exigent circumstances, the panel has operated rather informally and has held no hearings. Issues of panel rules, panel process, resource allocation, minority rights, and the panel's hearing agenda remain unresolved. In order to be an effective advocate for the American taxpayer, I have to ensure that every panel member has the resources and rights necessary to conduct effective oversight. And I wish to ensure that the panel officially adopts a serious hearing agenda that brings transparency and accountability to the process. I have raised these concerns, but I assume due to the urgency and exigency of the circumstances, they have yet to be addressed. The report today, Mr. Chairman, and I will conclude briefly, has many good points and questions that I agree need to be asked of Treasury. I, however, remain concerned about language that I believe can be interpreted as a panel expectation that Treasury adopt policies that could make credit more expensive and less available and policies that could delay the recovery of our housing market at exactly the wrong time. Mr. Chairman, I hope that soon I can conclude that taxpayers' voices are effectively represented on the panel. The panel represents a serious attempt at bipartisan oversight. Until such time as I can conclude that, I cannot and will not in good conscience approve any panel reports. Regardless of the panel's future or my future, I remain committed to bringing the highest level of accountability and transparency to the process. With that, I appreciate the chairman's indulgence and his accommodation to my schedule. I yield back.",Statement,STATEMENT OF THE HONORABLE JEB HENSARLING (TX-05), CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT PANEL UNDER THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Hensarling. Since Mr. Hensarling is technically a member of Panel Number 2, the committee members would have a right to exercise an examination of Mr. Hensarling. But because of his other commitment, what I would suggest, unless there is some pressing question that has to be immediately answered, that any questions either side of the committee has for Mr. Hensarling be submitted in writing. I am sure he will accommodate the committee by answering the same in writing. Is there any objection to that? The Chair, hearing none, Mr. Hensarling, thank you very much for your testimony. Now we will resume with our Panel Number 1. The gentleman from California.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I will have a number of questions for the record because 5 minutes is not enough to ask all the questions I have. Let me first start with a question that affects the travel plans of all of my colleagues. Mr. Kashkari, how certain are you or confident are you that Treasury will not be asking for the final $350 billion in a formal submission to Congress this month?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I am not certain of the timing of any such submission. Ultimately, the Secretary would make the determination, likely in consultation with--",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","I look forward to singing Christmas carols with my colleagues on the steps. But can you at least assure me that we are not going to get such a request in the next day or two?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, Congressman, honestly, I don't want to make promises. It is the Secretary's determination.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Has the Secretary clued you in that he is planning to ask for the money in the next day or two? Wouldn't he tell you? You are running the program.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We talk about that topic quite often, and ultimately it is the Secretary's decision to be made.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","I am asking you whether he has indicated to you that he is going to ask for the money in the next day or two.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","He has not indicated that.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Thank you. Now, one of the most fun things, especially at this time of year, is to play Santa Claus, particularly when you can be generous and it doesn't cost you anything. One thing that the Treasury has done is to buy preferred stock in these banks and get warrants that are supposed to compensate the taxpayer for the risks we are taking. But, of course, Treasury accepted one- sixth the warrants that Warren Buffet got in a similar transaction, and took the same number of warrants from every institution, whether it was a high-risk institution or a low- risk institution, indicating that we are being generous to the shareholders and executives of the high-risk institutions. But I want to focus first on another act of generosity. Section 111 of TARP says: ``The Secretary shall require that the financial institution in which you invest meet appropriate standards for executive compensation.'' The law then lists three particular items that you need to put into the stew. But the mandate is clear; not just deal with these three particulars involving like golden parachute-type contracts, but devise appropriate standards, enforce appropriate standards on executive compensation. Now, after AIG got TARP money, they announced and are in the process of paying bonuses as high as $3 million or $4 million. Sir, have you met your responsibility to require that appropriate standards of executive compensation be imposed on AIG and the other recipients of TARP funds?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, this is an important issue in which we must not lump all the institutions together.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","I am not. I am asking about AIG. Is a $3 million bonus an appropriate standard of executive compensation, or has the law been violated?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I don't have the details of what the bonus levels are at AIG.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","You are the one who is supposed to impose appropriate levels of executive compensation. Have you done that? Are they making payments of executive compensation that are not appropriate, or are you just blind to whether they are appropriate or not?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, we have imposed on AIG new corporate governance standards, executive compensation standards.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Do your standards prevent the payment of a $3 million bonus?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I do not believe that they specifically prevent a payment of $3 million.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","So have you imposed appropriate standards for executive compensation? Are you here to tell this committee that appropriate standards of executive compensation would allow a $3 million bonus? How about a $30 million bonus; would that be appropriate executive compensation, or would that be prohibited by any standards that met the statutory requirement imposed on by Treasury?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, in the case of AIG we were placed--please permit me to finish. This is a very important issue.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Sir, I didn't ask you about corporate governance, I didn't ask you about the makeup of the executives. I asked whether a $3 million bonus or a $30 million bonus is consistent with a statutory requirement that we have appropriate standards on executive compensation. Let me ask it specifically: As to $30 million, is that appropriate or inappropriate, or you have no opinion?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I am not in a position to opine on a specific number, if it is appropriate or not.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Well, when Congress tells Treasury to limit things to appropriate compensation, I would hope that you would devise such standards. And so the standards that you have written so far do allow $30 million bonuses to be paid. There is nothing that Treasury has done that would prevent a $30 million bonus, correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Ultimately, I believe, and I need to check, the Treasury and Federal Reserve, the U.S.--",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Sir, you wrote the regulations. What is in them?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congress, ultimately the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, because now the taxpayers own 80 percent of AIG, are in a position to approve specific compensation standards. My point in talking about the executives--we want to get the taxpayers' money back, in the case of AIG. And so we needed to put in place a management team, hire quality managers. For me to come in here and say, well, $100,000 is the right number or $500,000; I don't know the right number.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Sir, these bonuses were paid to executives that had been there for a while and a part of the team that ran the company into the ground, and your level of generosity is in stark contrast to the suffering of the people in my district. I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. May I add something? That is the one question that I hear more of as I travel across this country, the absolute frustration of the American people in this Administration not imposing some standard or rule. I have to just make the point because we just finished the examination with the auto industry. We have a successful CEO running Toyota in the United States, getting $1 million a year as compensation, and we have a very unsuccessful CEO in the United States, running one of the major car companies called GM, getting $23 million a year. The American people are just wondering what is wrong with this Administration that they can't establish a standard of compensation. Mr. Kashkari, are you saying you don't have the capacity to make those standards down there? Do you want us to do it? Is that what you are recommending, that we legislate that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I am suggesting respectfully that we were implementing the letter and spirit of the law. Very specific executive compensation provisions were spelled out in the legislation. We have met every single one of those in every case we have made an investment. We took those very seriously.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","So it is your opinion that the Congress, in regard to compensation, inadequately structured the law.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I don't believe the Congress specified that you want to set a specific cap on what an appropriate payment level is.",Speech,
"Mr. Sherman","Mr. Chairman, if I can just quote the statute, subdivision (b) of section 111 includes the words: ``The Secretary shall require the financial institution meet appropriate standards of executive compensation.'' It requires Treasury to decide what that means. And apparently it means $30 million is just fine, since the regulations they wrote do not prohibit a $30 million bonus, nor is Mr. Kashkari willing to say here and now that he would not allow $30 billion bonuses in the future. I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much. While I have you, Mr. Kashkari, I heard you defend the right of some of these entities to pay dividends. There is a difference. I served on boards of directors in my past, and there is a way of paying cash dividends and paying stock dividends. There is no reason in the world, if you want to encourage people to participate and therefore they need a dividend, give them a cash dividend. If they want to go out in the marketplace at the rate the market pays for their shares of stock, let them sell that interest. But there is no reason to be handing out millions and millions of dollars of taxpayers' money as a dividend to some existing companies and say it is perfectly justified because it encourages people to invest or make a contribution of equities. There are other ways of getting equity to people and to encourage them to participate. I think it is just sloppy management, if you want my honest opinion. And I think I am hearing from you today that we should reinstigate some of these rules and regulations and start laying down a congressionally mandated standard. Set it out. I think one of them we are all talking about now is, by God, if the CEO of Toyota, running one of the most successful auto manufacturing companies in the world can do it on $1 million a year, it just seems to me it is not a bad standard if the taxpayers of the United States are paying for the operation of a motor company in this country, that we accept that standard; and if somebody doesn't want to work for $1 million a year, maybe we could entice the President to give up his $400,000 salary and come to work for $1 million a year for running that company, or any Members of Congress for that case, or some of the professors at our universities and law schools. We may be able to find somebody in this country who is willing to take that. Anyway, I have rambled on enough. Our next participant is Mr. Roskam.",Speech,
"Mr. Roskam","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I just would point out, my predecessor, Henry Hyde, had a way of describing this conundrum, and he observed that there is one thing worse than gridlock, and the worse thing than gridlock is the greased chute of government. It is exactly what we are dealing with today, a greased chute that created this TARP program and now, seriously, there are Members of Congress who are looking at the Administration, and the Administration is looking at Members of Congress, saying, oh, is this what you meant? It is really shocking. So here we are, several hundred billion dollars into this. I want to shift gears a little bit and really go toward part of the conversation during the deliberation of TARP that really didn't get a lot of discussion and that was revisiting mark-to-market. As you know, mark-to-market is a good idea sort of in theory and in a post-Enron environment where there were manipulations in the past that had to be dealt with. But my question is: There has been all this energy and capital that has been injected into the marketplace, either originally in the purchase of toxic assets or now ultimately in direct capital injection, and that is bringing capital in one way; but are we adequately making sure that there are not regulations in place that are draining the market of the very capital that we are trying to create? Could you comment, because basically when the mark-to- market conversation came up during the TARP deliberations, there was sort of this pat you on the head, tap you on the backside, and kind of a feeling of it is really interesting, but off with you, be lively, we are not really interested in that, because the orthodoxy that had developed was we are going to pump capital in, and that is the way we are going to do it. Now that we can be a little bit more reflective, is there an interest or is there a recognition that mark-to-market and some of the changes need to be in play and need to be more than sort of the dalliance that we have seen from the Securities and Exchange Commission so far, but there has to be a real safe harbor here?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I remember the discussions that you reference from the negotiations. Mark-to-market is a very important issue. You are right to raise it. A lot of people have raised it. First, as you know, I believe the legislation called for the FCC to undertake a thorough study of mark-to- market, and I believe they are well underway and their report is due, I believe, on January 2nd. So they are consulting both internally with government experts and with outside experts to look at mark-to-market. There is no question that mark-to- market is procyclical and it is exacerbating the swings. At the same time, we have not seen a better alternative. There are cases in history where countries have pretended that their assets were worth a lot more than they ultimately were worth, and they prolonged their economic downturn and their economic crisis. So we clearly need to find the right balance. What we have right now where there is no bid in the market also does not appear to be optimal, clearly; but just also pretending these loans are worth more than they are does not also seem to be a good solution. So I will respectfully defer to the FCC and their ongoing work to study this issue. It clearly needs to be studied very carefully.",Speech,
"Mr. Roskam","We are not going to settle this in the couple of minutes that we have this afternoon, but it seems to me that the urgency with which the original TARP deliberation took place, we would have been well-served had that same urgency and that same clarity been brought about to require or to provoke-- use any verb you want to--but to get a fundamental change in mark-to-market. It would seem to me there were things that were on the table that would have been substantive and very helpful, and we may have been in a very different situation right now. Let me just turn quickly, Mr. Dodaro, could you comment on that element of things? In other words, as the GAO evaluates TARP, can--or is part of your deliberation and your evaluation, regulatory burdens that may be in place, impediments to progress that Congress itself can remove, or the Securities and Exchange Commission or FASB or others? Is that part of your portfolio, so to speak?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","It is not part of the specific requirements under TARP for us to take a look at it. It is more program implementation, whether it is meeting the performance and expectation of goals of the legislation. But we do have other authorities and other work that we have underway to look at the regulatory structure which we think needs to be reexamined in light of current events, and we will have a report to the Congress with some criteria and characteristics that we think should be guiding principles in reexamining the regulatory structure. We also have an effort underway to look at, similarly, criteria that could be considered in making a determination as to the ultimate character of the entities for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac once they emerge from conservatorship. We are also following the mark-to-market situation closely at the SEC, and we will be in a position to comment on that as well.",Speech,
"Mr. Roskam","Thank you. I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Clay.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and I thank the witnesses for their amazing testimony today. We have witnessed an amazing set of events since we originally passed TARP--I guess while we passed TARP. The Administration was able to influence a majority of the members of this legislature to go along with the plan that they said they were sure would rescue the U.S. economy. Several weeks later, you dumped the entire plan and said, oh, that probably won't work. I didn't think it would work then, and I don't think you all know what you are doing now. Let me ask you, Mr. Secretary, we own 80 percent of AIG. What benefits do the taxpayers of this country--what have we derived in benefits from owning 80 percent of AIG, lending them a total of $125 billion? Did we buy the assets or were the assets sold? If so, to whom? And how is AIG managing those assets now if they didn't sell them?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, let me start by saying we didn't want to own 80 percent of AIG. We didn't want to intervene in AIG. AIG was on the verge of collapse, which jeopardized the financial system as a whole. So we had to take this action.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Jeopardized what?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","The financial system as a whole.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Look, I am from Missouri. We speak plainly. People of Missouri want to know. What if they had failed? So what? What if they had failed? What would have happened?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is hard to know for sure. It is conceivable that the financial and banking system would not function. Imagine if you went to your ATM and couldn't get money out of your checking account, or your money just wasn't available, or your 401(k) was worth half as much as it was the day before. It is hard to know.",Speech,
"Mr.  Clay","Based on AIG failing.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","AIG is a trillion-dollar institution with transactions and counterparties around the United States. We took this action to make sure that a collapse did not happen because the consequences were grave. And now, because we had to step in to stabilize them, we have tried to provide as much protection for the taxpayers as possible. So now the taxpayers own 80 percent of the company. The new management's job is to do an orderly disposition of some of the businesses, to generate cash to pay back the taxpayers so that we are made whole.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Today, Mr. Secretary, what is the company worth?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I don't know the answer to that. I will try to find out. I don't know the answer to that.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Thank you. Let me ask you about GAO's recommendations. There are nine recommendations. One of them, my friend from California brought up. What measures have CPP taken to ensure that institutions comply with executive compensation, dividend payments, and repurchase of stock; and have you all taken the recommendations of GAO and instituted them?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, Congressman. We agree with GAO's recommendations and we are already instituting them. That is why we felt good about the report, because it verified the directions that we felt we were already going. These are not going to happen overnight. We are instituting the programs now. Now, most importantly, executive compensation, dividend restrictions, these are contractual agreements between the United States Government and these institutions. If they violate our contracts, we have many legal recourses to go after them, including going to the Justice Department and going after them. So I think banks will be very hesitant to sign a contract with the U.S. Government and then not fulfill their obligations. We are going to go after them. The regulators are already supervising, and we are looking at other measures to make sure that they continue to comply.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Thank you for that response. We understand the TARP program continues for credit card, auto loan and student loans. However, private lenders for non-Federal student loans enjoy Federal protections that auto and credit lenders do not; namely, private student loans are exempted from bankruptcy, except under extreme circumstances. How will the TARP program take into consideration these differences in consumer debt?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I don't know the answer to that. I would have to talk to my colleagues at Treasury who are implementing it with the Federal Reserve. It will help all classes of the consumer credit, but I don't know how it will take into account the bankruptcy difference.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Mr. Secretary, would you please get back to us on what AIG is worth on this day?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Mr. Clay","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Clay. We will now hear from Mr. McCotter.",Speech,
"Mr. McCotter","Thank you. Mr. Kashkari, you have a very difficult job. I know you work under Mr. Paulson, who works under the President, and sometimes things roll downhill. Yet they roll inevitably anyway. With that said, I heard your testimony, read through it, and it gave me great insight for the next time I take a weekend trip with my wife. I am generally loath to ask for directions or assistance, which greatly annoys my wife, but the next time that she claims we are lost, I am simply going to say, ``We are taking many steps to adapt to events on the ground. And we have made remarkable progress in only 68 days, Dear. We cannot be lost, because I am sure that I know what I am doing.'' So in that spirit of disconcertion, I would like to ask you a couple of questions. The first thing that I found very interesting as this began was the concept of stigma--the stigma of having to receive taxpayer assistance for a problem that you may have caused. Now we have seen individuals, average working people who are down on their luck and have had to go through things such as drug testing to receive Federal assistance or State assistance, because the stigma that attaches to seeking government benefits is a protection of the taxpayer because it prevents other people from coming forward and seeking assistance when they do not really need it. And yet, in the instance of the bailout, we have heard that we cannot stigmatize financial institutions that come forward for taxpayer money; that would be wrong. And we hear reports of healthy financial institutions being asked to take taxpayer money they don't necessarily want so that the stigma does not attach to the people who have helped cause this problem, unlike individuals. So I would like to ask the logic behind that, because it seems to me that if you hand out taxpayer money to avoid a stigma, that you will then stigmatize those who do not unnecessarily take taxpayer money. It seems counterintuitive to me. Secondly, we have heard discussion from the gentleman from California, Mr. Sherman, that there is a prospect that the second round of billions of dollars will be asked for because, as you know, we have only appropriated directly $350 billion-- ``only'' $350 billion. And yet as I read through the testimony, the GAO has identified several instances where, shall we say, oversight has to continue to occur. And this--if I am wrong, correct me--but we have already spent $200 billion. I think with AIG at $40 billion, we are over $200 billion.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I think that is approximately correct.",Speech,
"Mr. McCotter","Let me see what we haven't done. We have already spent $200 billion and these things have not been done completely yet. We have not developed a comprehensive system of internal controls, we have not issued final regulations on conflicts of interest, we have not instituted a system to manage and monitor the mitigation of conflicts of interest. And I could go into the other six items. This is after $200 billion of taxpayer money has been spent in a program that has had more twists and turns than an Agatha Christie plot. So my question is: How can there be consideration of asking for another $350 billion in taxpayer money for this program when these controls are not in place for accountability and oversight and $200 billion has already been spent?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, Congressman, again, as indicated in my testimony, it has been 68 days since the President signed the law. We have teams of people working around the clock to build the operation, design the programs, and implement them all at the same time. We would love it if the financial markets just healed themselves and we could go at a much slower pace and just implement this thing as a normal government program would be implemented. We haven't had that luxury. We have had to move quickly, we have had to adapt to events on the ground, and we are going to continue to move aggressively as long as we are here.",Speech,
"Mr. McCotter","As I remember, when we met with Mr. Bernanke, some of the House Republican leadership, and--I think it was Bear Stearns--there was an indication that the entire financial system could melt down because of the interconnectivity due to the credit market and the stakes that have been made. I also remember reports that potential scenarios for legislation such as this and a program such as this had been prepared by potentially Treasury and the Federal Reserve for just such a potentiality occurring. So I am aware of the 68 days because I was voting against it. And I have been counting the days until we actually have someone from the CEOs come in, and I thank Chairman Frank for that. But this isn't as if you are telling me that the Republican Administration of President Bush was sitting there and Secretary Paulson and his predecessor were sitting there with absolutely no indication whatsoever that this could be potentially a problem down the road that might need some type of foresight and forethought put into a potential plan. You make it sound as if it was an economic Pearl Harbor that came without warning. I think the facts preceding the 68 days tend to disprove that. But that is my opinion.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, Congressman, over the course of the the winter and the spring--I think I mentioned earlier--we thought there may come a time when the government would have to step in to provide capital because the private sector was unwilling to, and began planning for such a contingency. It is very different to lay out the broad strokes of a plan and to work through the very detailed internal control procedures. We hired PWC, who is working with us. You can't do that in advance.",Speech,
"Mr. McCotter","If I can, because my time is up, I welcome your response in writing. Let's just be clear: The broad stroke that you outlined was a TARP program of toxic assets, and that proved to be wrong.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It proved that the credit crisis intensified deeply in the 2 weeks between when Secretary Paulson first came to the Congress and the Congress acted. I can show you lots of data that substantiates that. And I would be happy to, Congressman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","I thank the gentleman. The gentleman from Massachusetts, Mr. Lynch.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Let me pick up right where Mr. McCotter left off. And I appreciate both witnesses hanging in, and your help with the committee's work today. One of the central factors within this current crisis has been the lack of reliable information in the credit markets with respect to counterparty risk. That has been a huge part of this. I think what Mr. McCotter--part of what he was saying, not to put words in his mouth--was some of the things that Treasury has done in this whole process has really hurt confidence. Getting us all in line here for this toxic asset purchase program and getting enough votes and then, a few days later, just completely changing, without any explanation or any real debate here, changing the whole program here so now the Troubled Asset Relief Program doesn't purchase any troubled assets. That all goes away. That itself is very upsetting to the markets when you say you are going in one direction and all of a sudden you go in the other. A couple of other things: The dramatic infusions of cash into a lot of these banks. And we heard the reports about how several of them actually said they didn't want the money, they didn't need the money. That doesn't instill a lot of confidence in folks either, especially when there are so many people in other industries begging for help. I don't think that really pumping up the capitalization 1 or 3 percent in these banks is going to address the underlying fear of a lot of banks that they are not sure that their counterparty or other lenders, other banks, are not going to go belly-up at some point because of some CDOs that they hold, or that there may be something that would lead them to be unable to repay their loans. So for me, really a lot of what needs to be done here deals with transparency. Again, this TARP program, when you think about it, is really operated in the dark, with the exception of the work that Mr. Dodaro has been trying to do. The bill called for a Special Inspector General. And I am not blaming you, Mr. Kashkari, but under the bill, the new Inspector General is supposed to inform Congress within 60 days of his swearing-in over at the Senate. He is never going to file a report. He is going to be gone. By the time he is required to report to us, he will have been gone. There will be a new guy in his place with the new President, I suspect. It is reasonable to assume. The new guy won't have to report until the 3rd week of March. So we are going to have, very likely, $700 billion out the door without having had anyone, other than the good work of Mr. Dodaro, telling us where the money is, what it has been used for. With these new plans that have been going out there, now we are going to start to, as I understand, purchase some asset- backed securities; but there will be no information for Congress or the people whom I represent, who keep asking me, ``What are we buying, who is getting the money, where is it going?'' There is a disconnect here. Believe it or not, at some point I will stop talking. What are we doing? What are we doing to address that piece of it, the lack of transparency? We have to get this thing going again. As long as people don't trust each other, as long as there is no transparency here, folks are going to be afraid to lend. And I am afraid that some of those flaws, some of those frailties, are reflected in your own organization, this TARP program, because there is a lack of transparency there. We can't understand what is going on and we don't have a regular flow of information back and forth. How do you help that situation?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you, Congressman. It is something I am personally very focused on. I give a lot of updates to the country in the form of speeches and hearings such as this so that people can see in granular detail what we are doing. But let me also comment on reporting. The legislation calls for many levels of reporting: Transaction reports within 2 days of every investment; traunch reports every time we obligate $50 billion; and a report to Congress within the first 6 days of our first commitment, and then monthly thereafter. We have met every single one of our reporting requirements, every single one, on time. All of this information--there is a wealth of information on the Treasury Web site, and I am having a heck of a time getting people to go there and look at it. People say, ``We don't have the data.'' And I say, ``Well, have you looked at the Treasury Web site? It's all there.'' They say, ``No, I hadn't looked there.'' So we need help getting the message out because we are putting so much data out there, I am afraid we are overwhelming people with too much information and too much data.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","Mr. Dodaro, what do you think Mr. Kashkari can do to help that transparency issue, in addition to what he has just commented on?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","First of all, our first couple of recommendations, particularly the one that focuses on tracking what the individual institutions are doing with the money and providing reporting back as to what is happening at that level, I think would do wonders for transparency. I do agree with Mr. Kashkari, they are posting a lot of information. But the bottom line is, what are people doing with the money? That is what people want to know.",Speech,
"Mr. Lynch","I agree. Thank you for your forebearance, Mr. Chairman. I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Lynch. Now, Mr. Heller.",Speech,
"Mr. Heller","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the patience of those at the desk today. By the time you get to me, you have had to have been very patient, so I do appreciate spending a few minutes. Mr. Chairman, thanks for the hearing and the opportunity to ask a few questions. The specific question I have is if you are a nonsystemically significant institution, i.e., a State- chartered bank, an independent community bank, or perhaps a credit union, is it a waste of your time to apply for TARP funds?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, we want all of our healthy banks across the country to apply and participate in the program. We put out term sheets, as I am sure you are aware, for public banks as well as for private C Corp banks. There are other categories of banks such as the mutuals, subchapter S, which we are working to come up with term sheets so they can access the funds on the same terms as everybody else. There are some real legal complexities with doing that, and we are working to make this as broad a program as possible, because we want the healthy banks around the country to participate.",Speech,
"Mr. Heller","I am looking at the list of 87 banks that are currently participating in this program. I see in here one bank from South Carolina, the First Community Corporation. I don't know how large that is. There is one bank in Nevada that is a regional bank, so it is in Nevada, Arizona, and California. They may very well be State-chartered banks or independent community banks.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I don't know. I can find out. In each case, the bank must have a primary Federal regulator. So if there is no Federal regulator, it would not be in the program because we are relying on the primary Federal regulators to do the initial screen to the applications and then make recommendations to us. It has been essential for us. Because we want to use taxpayer resources efficiently and protect the taxpayers, we don't want to invest in banks that are nonviable or unhealthy banks in the Capital Purchase Program so we are relying on the Federal regulators to make an initial screen. And if there is a bank that does not have Federal regulation, then they would not be in the program.",Speech,
"Mr. Heller","I guess the definition of nonviable or a healthy bank would be very helpful in this process because we have numerous bankers, as I mentioned in my opening statement, that have called me and asked me, ``What are the criteria? We go to your Web site, we take a look at the Web site, we fill out the application, and we wait.'' Is there something out there that can determine the viability of a financial institution, some of the criteria that you just mentioned that I can share or spread with these other bankers so that they are aware of what the criteria is to become a healthy bank or unhealthy bank, a viable bank or nonviable bank?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Let me just start with, if you will permit me, there are many applications in the system. So the applications go through the regulators. There are literally hundreds and hundreds of applications that the regulators are processing, and then they are submitted to Treasury for review and approval. The Treasury process is actually very efficient. When it comes to funding these deals, oftentimes it is the banks who need more time than Treasury. So my first response is, I would recommend, respectfully, that you go back to your banks and say, ``It's probably being looked at by the regulator right now on its way to Treasury.'' So don't interpret the fact that it is taking some time to be reviewed as the fact that they are not going to be eligible for the program, number one. Number two, the viability judgment. There is no one measurement you can look at. The regulators and Treasury look at capital positions, look at exposure to real estate, look at how many nonperforming loans, look at different ratings that the regulators look at. Because each bank is unique, we can't point to one measurement and say, this is the one test. The regulators look at a wealth of information in coming up with an overall assessment that we then review and make the decision on.",Speech,
"Mr. Heller","You can understand the frustration where I am coming from with these independent bankers calling me and saying, ``Hey, we have done what we have been asked to do. In fact, we have invested in GSEs as we were asked to do, either by this Congress or through the Administration, and yet we have these applications out there and we are getting no feedback. We continue to ask, we continue to write letters, and there is just no information coming back as to whether or not we are considered a healthy bank, whether we are considered a viable bank.'' And what they want to know is, is there any way--and I understand it is a clouded question because it is very difficult to pinpoint specific viability or not--but there has to be some criteria out there that they can use in order to determine whether or not they can actually apply or should be applying for these TARP dollars.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is a very good question. Most banks that apply, the vast majority are ultimately going to be approved, just having gone through the investment committee so many times now, watching the process. There are some banks that in the regulators' judgment are not viable, in which case they will go to the bank and say, maybe you shouldn't apply, or you should withdraw your application. If that hasn't happened, they should feel pretty good. But ultimately, it needs to work through Treasury to make the final decision.",Speech,
"Mr. Heller","Thank you. I yield back. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Heller.",Speech,
"Mr. Miller"," Mr. Miller of North Carolina. I agree with those members who have said that we have to get a handle on the foreclosure problem. Credit Suisse, I think just this week, said we are probably going to experience 8.1 million foreclosures or perhaps 10.2 million foreclosures, which is almost one mortgage in five, in the next 4 years. If we don't get control of that, nothing else we do is going to work. But my questions are about due diligence. You have said that you are trying--you are working carefully to make sure we are putting money in viable institutions and we are relying principally on the principal regulators to assess viability for that determination. There was a sentence in the Congressional Oversight Panel's report that was striking: ``The Citigroup experience, the AIG experience, raise questions about assessment of institutional health and need by Treasury and by bank regulators.'' No kidding. AIG, I understand, got into trouble not because of anything the subsidiaries are doing, which are very closely regulated by State insurance commissioners, but by the parent, the holding company, which is, as I understand it, almost entirely unregulated, and because of the business derivatives and credit defaults were almost entirely unregulated. What regulator did you depend upon to assess the viability of AIG?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, when we talk about the regulators assessing viability, I am speaking about the Capital Purchase Program. It is $250 billion for a healthy bank. AIG was a separate program. That is the systemically significant failing institution program, where the regulators were not assessing viability, the regulators were assessing what would happen if we had allowed them to collapse. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. That was my impression as well, that it had nothing to do with viability. And that was the gist of your answers to Mr. Clay's questions a couple of minutes ago. There was a story in The New York Times on November 11th that talked about the systemic risk and about making good on derivative contracts by AIG. The usual rule in the economy is when you do business with somebody and you can't perform the contracts, you lose. But those who were in derivative contracts with AIG aren't losing; that the money that we put into AIG is being used to pay them in full. Lynn Turner was quoted as saying, ``We are funding someone on the other side.'' And the article said that neither AIG nor the Treasury was identifying who the significant counterparties were for AIG. Did The New York Times just not look on your Web site? Have you identified who those counterparties are? And if you have not, why have you not?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We have not--to my knowledge, we do not have a list of all of AIG's counterparties. We now have examiners, especially with the Federal Reserve, onsite at AIG, going through all of their books and records to try to understand their businesses and sell off assets over time in an orderly manner to pay back the taxpayers. So we have examiners onsite now and can look into that. But the reporting requirements that I spoke about were all of the requirements under the law for all the investments we make. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Are you going to tell us, ever, who got the money that we paid under AIG's derivatives contracts? And if not, why not?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is hard to know--Congressman, it is a tough question because it is hard to know with a dollar in a company, did this dollar of the taxpayers go to this use, did it go to paying expenses? Mr. Miller of North Carolina. That is really not a credible response. Who were we paying off? Who are all of the counterparties in AIG's derivative contracts? Now, with respect to other people who are getting money from us, we are getting something. We are getting warrants, we are getting preferred stock, we are getting senior debt. But with respect to AIG, the money we are paying to their counterparties, in the words of Rob Blagojevich, ``We are not getting anything except appreciation.''",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, look at another example. When we put in money in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac--when you put money into a business, that goes to sustaining the business. So all of the customers, all of the contractors, all of the counterparties benefit from having put the money in to stabilize that business. I am just trying to understand how you isolate the derivative counterparties versus all of the customers of AIG who have benefited from the action as well. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. The subsidiaries, the folks who had boring old commercial lines and personal lines, they are getting paid. Those subsidiaries are fine. State regulators make sure they are solvent. The entity that is not is the parent, is the holding company. My understanding, and maybe I need to go on your Web site, my understanding was that those were always almost exclusively because of derivatives, credit default swaps, etc.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Forgive me. If we didn't put in the money to stabilize AIG, would all of those insurance customers still be getting paid? Mr. Miller of North Carolina. My understanding is that the subsidiaries were closely regulated. They are all solvent, fine. The problems with AIG are all the parent, the holding company, which is completely unregulated. Is that wrong?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I believe a lot of the problems were at the parent. Again, even if the parent ran into trouble, that doesn't mean the subs would necessarily be fine. Again, when we try to stabilize it, we are trying to stabilize the entity as a whole and ultimately allow them to sell off the subsidiaries so we can pay back the taxpayers. It is very hard to isolate one business and say the money went for this, and not that. That is what I am struggling with. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. With respect to Citigroup, was there anything about the panicked additional $25 billion in guaranteeing $306 billion in troubled assets without really saying much about what the assets were or why they were troubled, was there anything about that that undermined your faith in the principal regulator for Citigroup?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I think these are very large, very complex institutions, and the actions that we took for Citigroup were to strengthen the institution and improve confidence in the system as a whole. These institutions are not just there in isolation. A lot of times the market looks at these institutions in combination or in the aggregate. So we had to make sure confidence was there for the system as a whole.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Miller.",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kashkari, you have an economics background, I understand.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I have a finance background, sir.",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","A finance background. The severity of the credit crisis today is reminiscent, certainly not as severe, as what happened after the October 29th stock market crash in America. At the time, it was a contraction in the monetary supply by some 33 percent over 4 years. Today, the Fed is easing significantly. Interest rates are next to zero, we have TARP trying to pour money into financial institutions, and yet there is more than anecdotal evidence that there is a credit seizure. Even banks often refusing to lend to banks, let alone small business borrowers, etc. If you are not an economist by background, you are familiar with the term ``paradox of thrift.'' If each of us or any particular institution saves, that is probably a good thing at a micro level; but if everybody decides to save and not lend. Yet, that is exactly what is happening as banks and financial institutions put this money in their balance sheets to firm up their own creditworthiness. But they are, for a variety of reasons, not lending to others, including a crackdown by Federal Reserve regulations on existing loans to businesses and others. There is a severe credit contraction that continues today regardless of what you are trying to do with interest rates or with TARP. Are you familiar with what Mr. Isaac at the FDIC did during the 1980's savings and loan crisis to save the credit crunch in the United States?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I know several actions were taken, and we have studied many of them.",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","Well, it was successful. By the way, what they essentially did was take notes from banks over a 5- or 6-year window, and the Treasury gave, effectively, a note back. They were called network certificates. The importance of that trade was that for every million dollars, number one, the taxpayers got virtually all their money back. It was beautiful. Number two, it created $10 million worth of lending capability for every $1 million trade. Why we haven't used that as a model to save homeowners, to save small businesses and individuals, is beyond me. By the way, it is beyond Mr. Isaac, who actually saved us from severe credit problems at the time. I suggest that model to you. Since we sold this most recent bailout--by the way, I have been against all the bailouts. I believe this is not your fault or the Treasury Secretary's. I believe that you have been in charge of a fool's errand. Trying to micromanage something as complicated and centrally plan something as complicated as the American economy can never work, in my view. It never has worked. Are you familiar with the Nobel Prize winning economist, Mr. Hayek?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","With the name, but not his research.",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","Well, he wrote a book, and the title should be sufficient. He said that centralized planning, no matter how well intended, led to what he called--and this is the name of the book in quotes--``The Road to Serfdom.'' And bit by bit, that seems to be, in my view, where we are going. So I don't blame you. I think you have been instructed to lead a fool's errand. I do not think it is good for America, but I don't think it is because of anything particularly that you have done. I will say trying to micromanage the American economy with tinkering and bailing out individual institutions, and now going we are going on to the auto industry, apparently this afternoon, is a little bit like trying to manage the circus from the middle of the monkey cage. It may be fun, it is enjoyable to watch, but it is just not going to work, and I don't think it has ever worked for any economy on the planet in history. It never creates prosperity. And yet, we seem to be committed. We were told by the same people, both in the Administration and the leaders in Congress, that if we passed the stimulus package of $600 per taxpayer, including many nontaxpayers, that would fix the problem with the American economy. That was 8 months ago. We bailed out Bear Stearns and AIG. We were told that bailing out Fannie and Freddie this summer would do the trick. By the way, Mr. Dodaro, the GAO at the time estimated that the likely cost of the bailout of Fannie and Freddie would be $20 billion. Do you know what the current likely estimate is?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","No, but I can do some research and provide that for the record.",Speech,
"Mr. Feeney","I bet it is many multiples of the $20 billion. So, again, this is not GAO's fault. I think Congress and the Administration have led Americans in a direction that may be very difficult long term to recover from. There are things that we can do like managing a monetary supply not to create bubbles. There are things that we simply cannot do. Micromanaging the decisions of 300 million Americans and businesses and institutions is not something that Washington will ever do successfully, in my view. God bless you on your mission. I don't think it will work. I hope it does. It never has in history. With that, I yield back.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Feeney.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kashkari, first of all, the great concern we have is--the fundamental need right now are two things for us to get out of this doldrum that we have in our economy. One is we have to lend the money-- the banks have to lend the money. We have to get consumers to spend the money. As you well know from finance--and you are a man of finance--the banking system is sort of like the heart of our economy. Like our own heart and our own bodies, the primary function is to pump the blood to get throughout the body. That is what the banks are there for. But they are not pumping the blood, the money, out to the system. It is not getting out to the fingers, and out to the toes. It is not getting out there. It is not getting out to the homeowners who are hanging on by their fingernails, and not getting out to those people who need to keep their jobs. That is what we have to break through with. I want to deal with a couple of specific points, and I think that we can give you an example, and I want to get your answers as to how you might be able to help us to do this. For example, here is one example. In Atlanta, Georgia, we have the Hartsfield International Airport which, I am sure, if you have been around, everybody has gone through. It is the world's busiest airport. We have a great need now. We are building a second terminal, the Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal. However, without access to the short-term credit market, construction will stop. We need that access. The question is: Can Treasury make sure that the reserves and money and resources that are going to the banks be directed to unfreeze the market for State and local debt so that projects like this can go forward? That is nearly over 3,000 jobs that will stop. Now, can we do that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, we are very aware of the challenges of State and local finance in the municipal bond market and we are designing programs and plans. Right now, some of my colleagues are trying to directly address that so we can get credit flowing to State and local governments for the exact same reason that you are saying. So we have ideas on how to go about that and we are designing our plans and getting feedback from experts in the market and in the industry to make sure that they will work.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","But can we not use the banking system to do that, for example? And you are saying, yes, we can.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, I think that the banks have an important role to play. But I think that the non-bank financial sector is also really important, and we need to try to get both working.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Let me give you an example. Right now, today, a bank, the major bank in Atlanta, Georgia, where the airport is, SunTrust Bank, is coming and asking you for an additional $1.4 billion. Cannot you use that direction to put that marriage together, and cannot we use that as a pattern, that, as we go about getting moneys into these banks, that we systematically have an identification plan of which we can assist these banks, say, ``Okay, you want this money?''--these are taxpayers' dollars. They are not the bank's dollars. These are the taxpayers' dollars. We are the stewards of the taxpayers' dollars. The taxpayers want this money to get out into the system so they can stay in their homes, they can keep their car dealerships, they can keep their jobs, and we can build the expansion for the Maynard Jackson terminal airport. Or, for example, another example, at the same time in my district, in Clayton County, for example, we are on the verge of losing a hospital, because the hospital is $40 billion in debt to their creditors. Well, it seems to me that we ought to be able to--if the bank is down there--that is what I am saying. They are hoarding this. The communities around them are suffering. It is not just the homeowners who are not getting money; the businesses are not either. Can we do this?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I think we can continue to encourage banks to increase credit. And that is what we are working on with the regulators, to measure that now, so we have the data to know what is really happening. But I will say I am very cautious about getting into the business where the Treasury Department is telling an individual bank, ``You should make this individual loan.'' I think that is a bridge too far. I don't think the Treasury Department or Washington is the best place to make those individual decisions. But we think the system as a whole should get the credit out to the people who need it.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Right. Let me go to you, Mr. Dodaro--we have pumped $290 billion into these banks. Do we know how they are spending it? Do we have a record of where this money has gone? Because we have another $350 billion that we are going to put some halt on. I am going to do everything, I am here to stop any more, not another dime, going out to these banks until we get an accounting for how they have spent this $290 billion that is there. And hopefully, we can maintain a hold on this remaining $60 billion, since we are not using it. Or, hopefully, we can use it to get to Ms. Bair to help with the home foreclosure program. But could you answer that for me?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Right now, there is not a systematic reporting process in place to report back how this money is being used by the individual institutions. This was our recommendation.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","And let me ask you, your primary need to do this, is it not that you want to use your bank regulators to facilitate this?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","We believe that structure is already in place. It is something to build off of. In this case, you know, you have a new program, you don't want to create a whole new mechanism. You can build off the existing structure with the regulators who are already involved. Remember, they are the ones reviewing the applications in the first place from the bank and making the decision as to whether or not the institution is financially viable and sound. So they have knowledge about these institutions. They collect information on a quarterly basis. And what we are suggesting is they modify their normal collection process to get more information back, in a more timely manner than quarterly, but they get the information, and it gets fed in, and there is a systematic roll-up of this information, as best it could be determined.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Are you concerned that there may be too cozy a relationship that exists right now that should be re-examined between the bank regulators who are right there in the bank and the bank? Is that too close?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","You know, I am focused on getting the data, and I think that is what people want to be focused on, is getting the data. We trust the regulators to provide proper oversight of the system, and I am not questioning that.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","All right.",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","But I do think they need to be part of the solution here to get better feedback on how this money is being used. I mean, that is what everybody wants to know. They can help in accomplishing that.",Speech,
"Mr. Scott","Thank you, Mr. Chairman.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much, Mr. Scott. Mrs. Bachmann?",Speech,
"Mrs. Bachmann","Mr. Chairman, thank you. And thank you gentlemen for being here for this long period of time. I appreciate it. I, too, voted against the bailout, and I must say that, in the time that we were away from this body after that vote, every day I was happier and happier that I had made that vote against the bailout. I can tell you most assuredly that my constituents are not happy with the bailout. And you are not responsible for all of them, but if you go back to January of 2008 and begin with the initial stimulus package, that was expected to be about $150 billion; it ended up being $168 billion. And then if you go forward from there and you go through the litany of all--the $29 billion for Bear Stearns, and then you go to the hundreds of billions for the Federal Home Loan Association, hundreds of billions of dollars for Freddie and Fannie. Each one of these initiatives, this is just the spring. We were told each one of these initiatives would help to bring about the turnaround in the economy. And it seemed what happened is, with each intervention, whether it was through the Federal Reserve or whether it was through Treasury or whether it was through the Federal Home Loan Association, each one of those measures seemed to only roil the stock market. So we would see increasing nosedives on Wall Street just as the American taxpayer was being asked to continually open up his or her wallet yet one more time and put more greenbacks on the table for troubled industries. After a while, as Members of Congress--and this, I think, is a bipartisan feel--we felt as though we were not being given the entire story. And that is what I think this GAO report said to me. When the GAO report came forward this month, I thought that the title said it all, ``Additional Actions Needed to Better Ensure Integrity, Accountability and Transparency.'' Literally what we saw in this report, then, was a litany of the shortcomings related to Treasury's lack of oversight of the TARP program. And that is something that I think that people in the United States right now are feeling: a real lack of security about what Treasury is doing. They feel there has been a lack of communication with this Congress. That has been itemized in this report that came out, that not only does the report feel that you have failed to communicate with this body, with the Members of Congress, but, in turn, with the American people. So they really don't know who to believe anymore. And that is the beauty of our country. The beauty of our system of government is that we govern by the consent of the people. I don't really believe that we have the consent of the people right now. And it seems to me that part of that responsibility must lie with Treasury, in that you have failed to adequately assure the public that the work that you are doing on the TARP program is work that is getting our country on the right side of the economy. And I don't say that in any personal way, but just that I believe that this report also gives backing to what I am hearing from my constituents. As a matter of fact, it refers to this as ``information gaps and surprises.'' And this communication, I think, is more than just irksome. I think that it has actually led to real market instability, where literally we can go 700 points up and then we can go 600 points down, then 200 up, then 800 down. People don't know what to do, and they are very frightened. And you see that even in the retail market for this important Christmas season. I, too, had members of the automobile dealers in my office yesterday. And they are telling me that people can't get loans unless they are at a 15 percent interest rate. That is keeping people out of their showrooms, and they are not being able to make these purchases. Now, I know that you are attempting, through your work, to try to bring those interest rates down. You are attempting to unthaw the credit freeze. But what it appears like to many of us is that what we are seeing over and over by government intervention is moving further and further away way from a free-market economy, not only in financial markets but also now in the auto industry. And there is a very real concern that we will not find an answer that comes with a free-market answer. I am wondering, will we get to that point when we return to a free-market economy? Or will we stay with a deep philosophy of government intervention at every turn? And so, finally, here is my question, and if we don't have enough time, I would ask that you respond in writing. How will you determine whether the capital that the government has injected into a specific institution is being used for lending purposes? This was one of the very concerns that I had with the fundamental principles behind TARP and the Capital Purchase Program. On one hand, government should not micromanage, and I believe that, the entire private banking industry. But on the other hand, how will you ensure that your plan achieves its goals so that we can actually unthaw this credit freeze?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, thank you for the comment. I will say three things. First, remember, when we started in this hearing, the overall objective of our actions has been to stabilize the financial system and to prevent a collapse, number one. Number two, we are working with the regulators to design the right measurements to look at loan levels, to see if increasing in lending is taking place relative to those who did not take the capital over time, to judge the merits of the Capital Purchase Program by themselves. And third, Mr. Chairman, if you will indulge me for just 30 seconds, to get some sense of the severity of this crisis, think about this: Bear Stearns; Washington Mutual; IndyMac; Fannie Mae; Freddie Mac; AIG; Wachovia; Lehman Brothers--all major U.S. financial institutions that have collapsed in the last 9 or 10 months. This is not a joke.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you very much.",Speech,
"Mrs. Bachmann","Mr. Chairman, thank you. And if I could just respond, my remarks were not that this is a joke. I think we all understand and take this very seriously, as do the American people. My remarks are that the American people no longer have confidence over how the program is being run. And the question again is, how will we have adequate oversight, as GAO has suggested Treasury needs to have, to make sure there is adequate communication with this body? Thank you. And, Mr. Chairman, thank you for your indulgence.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mrs. Bachmann. Now, we will hear from Mr. Green.",Speech,
"Mr. Green","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. And I thank the witnesses for being so patient. I know it has been a long day for at least one of you. Mr. Kashkari, you just indicated that the overriding aim-- and I am paraphrasing--of the program was to stabilize financial systems or financial institutions. I think that may be a part of departure with reference to your position or the position of the Treasury juxtaposed to the position of the Congress. Because, in Congress, we passed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. And when we passed it, we included therein the opportunity for the Secretary of the Treasury to establish TARP, the Troubled Asset Relief Program. It appears to us that the CPP, which is what you established, the Capital Purchase Program, is a little bit antithetical, not that it is of no good, serves no purpose, but it is a little bit antithetical to where we thought we were going to go from our perch. Our perch gave us one vista, and yours apparently accorded another vista. The question becomes this, given that we have these two different propositions before us. Focusing on the concern with reference to toxic mortgage-backed securities, I believe you concur and agree that they are a part of the problem that we are trying to confront. True?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Green","Okay. If they are--and we have at least one chairwoman, Chairwoman Bair, who has suggested that her plan will deal with, not in toto, but will deal with to a great extent toxic mortgage-backed securities. Do you concur that her plan does that, that it deals with toxic mortgage-backed securities?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It certainly attempts to deal with and reduce foreclosures, which would help toxic mortgage-backed securities.",Speech,
"Mr. Green","Exactly. So my question to you, and this is, to a limited extent, a follow-up on what Chairwoman Waters introduced to us earlier, and I think she was quite eloquent, but I do want to follow up. The question is, what are the deficiencies in the Bair program? And I ask this because, clearly, you have moved $20 billion from the TARP over to the Fed for the Fed to use with TALF. So you can move the money. There is no question about whether it can be moved, in my opinion, because you have demonstrated you can do it. It is a $200 billion program, but you are using $20 billion just as a sort of a backstop for some of the losses. So the question becomes, what is the problem with the Bair program, if there is a problem?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Sure. Thank you, Congressman. One of the other Members of Congress talked about competing interest and tensions. We have an interest to avoid preventable foreclosures. We also have an interest to protect the taxpayers. And one of the concerns that we have to look at very carefully are redefaults and what happens if borrowers redefault. If a borrower redefaults, that borrower is out of luck, because they are going to be out on the street, so that borrower has not been helped. If the borrower redefaults and then, at the same time, the costs to the taxpayer go through the roof, what have we accomplished? Comptroller Dugan, the head of the OCC, on Monday released data showing very high redefault rates for some types of loan modifications. And so one of the things we have to look very carefully at is, how do we make sure that the loan modifications are sustainable, that they are not going to lead to a lot of redefaults? And if there are redefaults, we don't want to reward the banks because the borrowers have lost a house. So we have to construct the right incentives so that the borrowers who need help are helped without creating the wrong incentives and rewarding the banks if the borrower redefaults. So there are some--Congressman, this is an issue that I have studied for 18 months, and it is probably the most difficult policy issue I have come across, is how do you find a program that helps the borrowers who need help without rewarding everybody who doesn't? You know, the legislation that this body, this committee championed, the HOPE for Homeowners legislation, was a very thoughtful attempt at this problem. By putting in place the taxpayer protections, not as many borrowers as we would like are getting the help that they need. And so, there are real tensions here that we are trying to work through to try to find the right solution.",Speech,
"Mr. Green","Permit me to ask this. The Bair program contemplates, I believe, 31 percent of income as the markdown in terms of monthly payments, trying to get persons at that point, because it is perceived that if you are at that point, you can afford the property. So it is a restructuring program. That formula apparently has attracted the attention of a number of economists who think that it can work. What do you see as a problem with that formula?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, it is not whether it is a 38 debt-to- income or 34 or 31; different people have different views. We have adopted a similar approach with Fannie and Freddie, where they are moving people down. The key is, if you are putting insurance on an asset, that is a payout if the borrower redefaults. Think about that. The bank only gets a payout if the borrower redefaults. Does that create an incentive for the bank to encourage a default and foreclosure? So we just have to look very carefully at these incentives to make sure that they are aligned so that the taxpayer dollars are really going to help the homeowners. That is our objective.",Speech,
"Mr. Green","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Green. Mr. Manzullo?",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kashkari, you were asked the question about whether or not you thought a $3 million bonus to an executive at AIG was excessive. And from my understanding of the answer that you gave to Mr. Sherman, your answer was no. Is that correct?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, my answer was I don't have a number in my head that says, this is an appropriate bonus level, and that is--",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Well, does anybody have a number in their head when we spend $125 billion of the taxpayers' money on AIG? Is a $3 million bonus too much to give to a person who was there and responsible when that company went under? Yes or no?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, our track record is clear--",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Your track record is clear here. I want a yes or no.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman--",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","I represent--no, let me tell you something. I represent a city--the largest city in my district has 11.3 percent unemployment, $41,000 a year median income. In 1980, Rockford, Illinois, led the Nation in unemployment, at 25 percent. I am asking you right now, and I want an answer, and there is a reason for it: Is a $3 million a year bonus excessive to a company owned 80 percent by the United States Government and into which over $125 billion of taxpayers' money has been invested?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is excessive for a failing institution, yes.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","All right. So are you going to ask for the money back, yes or no?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Forgive me, Congressman. Which money back?",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","The $3 million bonus that just went to the AIG executive. Are you going to ask for it back?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, Congressman, I don't know the details of the bonus that--",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","That is the bonus. If he got a bonus of $3 million, are you going to ask for it back?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, Congressman, I don't know the detail of the bonuses.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Mr. Kashkari.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes, sir.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","An executive at AIG just got a bonus of $3 million. The three executives from the Big Three said they would work for a dollar a year. I am asking you, if that is the case, is TARP going to ask for the money back, if they got the $3 million bonus?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Again, Congressman, I am going have to look into it and get back to you.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Mr. Kashkari, I want to suggest something here. And it is not because of--maybe it is because of the people I represent. We can't relate to you in your world. I don't know where you come from or the people with whom you deal on a day-to-day basis, but when you sit there and cannot take a position as to whether or not a $3 million bonus to a failed company and into which the taxpayers have put $125 billion in assets, perhaps you are not the right person for the job. Perhaps you don't understand the situation at all. Perhaps we should put somebody in your position who is one of my community bankers, who understands people. What would you think if you earned $41,000 a year and the city in which you live has 11.3 percent unemployment, yes, and five of the last governors in the State of Illinois have been indicted, and you sit here in charge of all this money, and you can't tell them whether or not a $3 million bonus to an executive at that failed institution is excessive?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","May I answer?",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Of course.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","There have been some press reports--and, again, I don't know the details of the specific case you are referring to--there have been some press reports about AIG that have referred to bonus schemes. When I have looked into it and had our people look into it, there have been some cases where they had deferred compensation that was already earned by people, not the CEOs--",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Well, deferred compensation of $3 million?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Remember, Congressman, we got rid of the management team of AIG.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Well, who are these new clowns getting that money? Why can't you just give a simple answer so the people I represent can have confidence in you? We don't have confidence in your answer; how can we have confidence in your decisions?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Because I am trying to be precise in my answer, Congressman.",Speech,
"Mr. Manzullo","Your answer is imprecise. I don't think you understand. I don't think you understand at all the pain and the hurting that is going on in this country, of the people who are on the verge of losing their jobs. And you can sit there and not come to a decision as to whether or not a $3 million bonus is too much? If you even have to ask that question, whether it is too much, Mr. Kashkari, you are not the man for the job. We need somebody else in that position. We need somebody with the long- term experience, somebody who has dealt with loans of ordinary, common people, somebody who understands the hurt that this country is going through, somebody that can feel their pain and the anxiety which they express to me on a daily basis. On the basis of your answer, sir, I think you should step aside.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Manzullo. The gentleman from Missouri, Mr. Cleaver.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Mr. Chairman. Mr. Kashkari, I actually feel sorry for you. And the reason is that it is Mr. Paulson who needs to be in that chair. Do you have staff members with you?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","A few.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Because I have been watching--I left for 20 minutes to meet with someone. By my count, there were four members who asked for information to be sent back to them. And I watched to see if anybody on the front row was writing down their names and what they asked for, and I didn't see it. If I overlooked, if you have it, if you could raise your hands? You wrote it down? Okay, I just looked at the front row, so I didn't see you back there on the second row. The reason I went there is because my concern is that--and maybe you can answer the question--do you know why we were not asked to come back as a committee to hear Secretary Paulson's reason for diverting the money to banks? I mean, the name of the program is ``Toxic Assets,'' and nothing went there. So I have been curious as to why we weren't called. You know, there was an emergency need for us to gather. Do you know?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, in the negotiations as we worked with the Congress to design the legislation, we worked very heard to build in flexibility because we knew the credit crisis is unpredictable. And so, as the crisis deteriorated in just the 2 weeks before when we first came to the Congress and when the Congress acted and then the 2 weeks that followed, we made rapid adjustments as facts changed on the ground. And the legislation provided us the flexibility that we needed to be nimble and adjust our strategy.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes, sir. I was here. I try to--I have never missed any of our committee hearings, and I try to get here on time--I do get here on time. You are absolutely right. But understanding that this was a dramatic turn from what Congress approved--I was listening to Lou Dobbs, which is self-prosecutorial, but I am listening to it, and he is starting the news off by saying, ``The government has switched.'' Now, I went to a town hall meeting in Belton, Missouri, just outside of Kansas City. There were about 125 people there, and they were furious because they think that I voted to switch. And I would dare say that the overwhelming majority of the people in this country believe that we voted to switch from what we initially said. And so, given the delicate nature of this, don't you think that we should have publicly said, ``This is the direction we need to go?'' I don't disagree with the direction you went. I mean, this is the European model. But can't you see--I mean, some of my colleagues, we have nothing in common except life, but I find myself agreeing with them because of the fact that we are the ones being politically bludgeoned. And it would have taken a call to Barney Frank. The Treasury did call Barney Frank. I had dinner with him the night that they did, the evening of the notification. But he didn't ask for any meeting; he told him what he was going to do.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, I appreciate the feedback. And, clearly, we have heard the message, and we understand the concerns that have been raised by us adjusting our strategy as we move forward. At the same time, we have had to move very quickly, as I have said, and market conditions have changed so quickly. I feel good about the actions that we have taken, that they were the right actions to take to try to stabilize the system.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","But don't you know that we would have gotten on airplanes and come right back to Washington?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I believe that, Congressman. And the actions that the Congress took in passing the legislation in just 2 weeks is truly remarkable. The crisis was intensifying at such a rate that even 2 weeks may not have been fast enough.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","It wouldn't have been 2 weeks to get on a plane to come back. I don't want to argue with you about plane travel. But I would like to switch now--I have to say this because I am hoping the people in my district will get a chance to understand that we had nothing to do with this, that this was not a bait-and-switch on the part of Congress. And I want--and maybe I am wanting too much--I just want some understanding of why people are angry up here. And the reason I ask about the notes is because I didn't want it to appear as if we don't matter, we just do things. And I didn't even get into the fact that we need a de-icer with credit. And if we are not giving money to Chrysler financing and GMAC, it doesn't matter how much money we put into the automakers, people won't be able to buy cars, because right now, the credit score required to get a car is between 700 and 725. There are people in this room who don't have that kind of credit score, and there is no money going into the entities that finance automobiles. I think I have run over, Mr. Chairman. I thank you for indulging me.",Speech,
"Mr. Kanjorski","Thank you, Mr. Cleaver. Mr. Perlmutter?",Speech,
"Mr. Perlmutter","I have a number of things, but first--and I didn't expect to be an apologist for the Treasury Department, but I do want to say that things have been moving at a clip that nobody could imagine. And I have been attending all of our hearings and hearing from different economists, from the left and the right and the center, who do appreciate the fact that the Congress acted quickly and that the Treasury is acting quickly to deal with some unprecedented twists and turns in an economy. So I do want to thank you for that. Now, I am going to chew you out. And the reason is--and I think part of Mr. Manzullo's criticisms, Mr. McCotter's criticisms, and Mr. Sherman's criticisms are that you have a massive undertaking here. You have 48 people that you have hired. That isn't enough. The Department of Defense, for $700 billion, has hundreds of people monitoring how that money is being used. And so the GAO, in its report, really had, in my opinion, two very serious critiques. One was you don't have the staff, and you are having to deal with this stuff on the run. We need more people to be able to monitor properly how it is happening. And, two, there does need to be a reporting system back to you from the banks as to where this money is going, if they are just recapitalizing themselves or they are purchasing another bank or whatever. So I sent you a letter last week signed by many of the members of this committee. How do you respond to the staffing question and getting the banks to report to you how they are using the money?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Right, both very important issues. On the staffing front, let me just offer a minor correction. When we talk about 48 or 50 people, those are full- time TARP staff. We have well over 100 when you combine the Treasury personnel who are spending almost all of their time working on it, as well. And, as we are ramping up, we are hiring actively so we can replace the Treasury staff with more and more full-time TARP staff. So I don't want to leave the impression that we have half the staff that we need. That is just not correct. We have the staff. We want more and more of the full-time. And this is one of our highest priorities. The people who report directly to me are sick of me bringing up hiring, hiring, hiring. It is just so important, and so I am spending a lot of my time on that, number one. Number two, on the data, in terms of what the banks are doing, again, this is the very point that we are working on with the regulators, to be able to collect the data and monitor what is happening at the system level and at the individual institution level, so that we can see, are our programs having their desired results?",Speech,
"Mr. Perlmutter","I disagree with a number of my colleagues who said that you were only authorized--and Secretary Paulson turned quickly--you were only authorized to buy the troubled assets. I think you were authorized under our legislation to do three things: One, buy troubled assets, these big portfolios. You were going down that path; you chose not to do it. Two, to recapitalize the banks. That seems to be about the thing that has been focused on. And then the third, which is a much broader kind of authority within the bill, was to use some of the other agencies of the government--the Small Business Administration, the Federal Home Loan Bank boards, the Farm Credit Administration--to get money down to Main Street. You have used the middle one, the recapitalizing, but not the other two. So a lot of our questions and a lot of the complaints that I hear in Colorado are, you know, homeowners-- one of the things you have talked about is maybe using Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or some other agency to help with purchases at a 4 or 4.5 percent rate. What is happening with that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, that is a program that we are looking at very carefully, talking to Fannie and Freddie about to understand how we would do it. No decision has been made yet, but we understand the merits of such a program to get people buying homes again. And if you will permit me--I am in no rush, I am happy to stay here as long as you would like--if you will permit me to just give a thorough answer, that leads to a broader point: We want to use the right tool for the right job. And the TARP is the only tool in the Federal Government, the only tool--Federal Reserve, Treasury, others--that can purchase equity. And so we want to use the TARP now, given the severity of the crisis, for what it is uniquely capable of doing and complement that with other tools. Fannie and Freddie are a great example--outside of the TARP, but potentially some powerful tools that we can bring to bear on this problem.",Speech,
"Mr. Perlmutter","Okay. Next question, the Treasury and the Federal Reserve turned Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley into banks over a weekend. We have heard now in this committee that GMAC, Chrysler Credit--I don't know about Ford Credit, but at least GMAC and Chrysler Credit have sought bank holding status so that they could receive TARP funds. Where are you on that?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","First, the Treasury does not make determinations about who becomes a bank holding company and who does not. It is the Federal Reserve who does; just a minor clarification. Second, I have heard similar things, that some of these entities are converting to bank holding companies to try to get access to the TARP. They would have to go through that process, get confirmed by the Federal Reserve, and still meet the application deadlines and be recommended by their regulator. So I can't speak to the individual applications that you spoke of. I am aware of the issue. We have a process and procedures in place to deal with it. But, ultimately, the regulators are making many of the decisions about who can become a bank holding company and who can't, and I just don't know where they stand in terms of those individual applications.",Speech,
"Mr. Perlmutter","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Thank you. The Chair recognizes Mr. Price for 5 minutes.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. I appreciate that. I want to apologize for being out of the room for a period of time. I had another conflict. I know that you all are getting tired. I appreciate your forbearance in sticking around. I want to echo the comments of my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Scott, who talked about Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport having difficulty gaining access to credit and an expansion of terminal facilities that have been on the books for a long time. Everything was rolling along well until recently, and many of the institutions that they are attempting to get resources through are ones that have gotten funds through the TARP. So it is a huge question that we have about who is getting this money, where is this money going. To that end, anecdotally, a constituent of mine owns a company that sells water utility software to governments and municipalities to help them comply with EPA regulations. This company has created 10 new jobs in the last year; it is growing about 50 percent each year. Recently told me about, in their next move to expand, he has gone to eight different banks to attempt to obtain credit. Three of these have received in excess of $30 billion through the TARP. At every turn, he has been told no. Where is this money going?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, it is not surprising to see that, with confidence still low, both fears of the credit crisis and the economic downturn, that banks are cautious about extending credit. And I hear the same anecdotes you do. Many people call us, saying, ``We need credit, we need help.'' And so the best we can do is to work with the regulators to make sure the banks are making prudent lending decisions. It is a delicate balance, because we don't want to go to a bank and say, ``You must make more loans even if you don't think those are good loans.'' We don't want to return to the bad lending practices that got us here in the first place. And so, how do we strike the right balance of encouraging the banks and pushing them to make prudent loans without taking on undue risk? And the regulators are looking at this. They put out a joint statement of how they are going to be supervising all banks. You know, all banks in America have benefited from the actions that we have taken, not just those that we have invested in. And they all have an obligation to extend credit in their communities. We are very focused on this, but I don't think it is going to happen as fast as you or I would like. But it is going to happen faster than had we not taken this action.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","I am not certain of that. But do you have a list, of the money that has been let, of the credit that has been provided?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Of the investments that we have made, we have.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","Not of the investments you have made; of the next step. That money is going out to whom?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Not yet. That is part of what we are working on with the regulators for the data that they collect, to try to aggregate, you know, the banks that are receiving the capital, are they loaning versus the ones that aren't. I don't know if we are ever going to get to the point of, you know, ``These 10 loans were made to these parties.'' That may be one layer too deep.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","Has any credit been extended out of the TARP funds?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","You mean have any of the banks that have received TARP capital made loans? Sure.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","How do you know?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I hear from firms who are getting new loans. I hear from banks that are making credit. It is not that banks aren't making any loans; they are just not making as many loans as they used to make.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","Is that information that you are able to provide for us? This fellow has a perfect credit score; his partners have a perfect credit score. Six months ago, he would have signed for a loan with his own signature. Now he has gone to eight banks and can't get any money. How is he supposed to expand his business? How are we supposed to move the economy?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, that is exactly why we are working as hard as we are, to try to get credit flowing again. We agree with what you are saying and why this is so vitally important to get credit out to the businesses and the consumers around the country that need it.",Speech,
"Mr. Price","Let me respectfully suggest that this whole process, frankly, is absolutely predictable. To put $350 billion on the table and have the Federal Government be in charge of keeping track of that $350 billion, which it has a difficult time doing, which continues to extend the time when private capital gets into the mix, because they are not certain how much more Federal capital is coming, that respectfully I would suggest that we are deepening the hole and lengthening the time before recovery. This fellow's example is all across this Nation, of private individuals who had no difficulty getting capital before. And, because of the, at least in some instances, the infusion of the rules and regulation morass that has gone on, he now cannot obtain any money at all.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","But forgive me, Congressman. We may just have a different view on this. Do you believe that, absent the actions that we have taken, he would have been able to get a loan?",Speech,
"Mr. Price","I think that, with the control of the Federal Government at the pursestrings of this process, that we have deepened the hole and lengthened the process to recovery. I have no doubt about that. I think that has been demonstrated in previous actions, and I think it has been demonstrated in other countries.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","The gentleman's time has expired. But, Mr. Kashkari, if you would like to respond, it would be appropriate.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I am okay. Thank you.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Okay. Congressman Donnelly?",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. And thank you, Mr. Kashkari. Thank you so much, Mr. Dodaro. We had sitting in those seats a week ago the CEOs of the auto companies, just as was being mentioned. And they said to us, ``Our financial companies have applied for TARP funds; we cannot get an answer.'' And, as you well know, we have a crisis in this country with these companies. And I was with dealers last week who said, ``I can't get these auto financial companies to provide us with funds for loans.'' And so, they can't get an answer, and it appears that we don't know where their application is in the process. Now, I would suggest that this is a matter of utmost urgency, that we try to make a decision on this. And so, who would know where their applications are in the process?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congressman, as the gentleman behind you raised, I think in these cases it is a two-step process. One is becoming a bank holding company--",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","Right. And I am trying to find out who would know, in the two steps, which step they are at today.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","That would be the Federal Reserve would be making determinations for firms who are becoming bank holding companies, number one. And then, second, the Federal Reserve would then receive their application for the Capital Purchase Program and submit it to Treasury. And so, you know, we can call the Federal Reserve--",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","So are you saying it is still at the Federal Reserve level right now?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","To the best of my knowledge, Congressman, but I can go back to our shop and--",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","Is there someone in your shop who could get that information to us by tomorrow at this time? Because this truly is a matter of national urgency.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Yes. We agree with you. And that is why something we spoke about earlier, the TALF program, is targeted specifically at consumer credit, such as auto loans, to bring rates down for borrowers.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","And that is a great number-two hitter. Now, the number-three hitter is getting these approvals done for TARP funds. And so, we are thrilled to have that coming along; we want to have that done. Now we have to get this done. And it seems to me what we have to do, more than anything, is find out where in the process it is. So somebody knows, and--",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Sure. We will find out and get back to you tomorrow.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","If you could call me back tomorrow to let me know.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I will.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","So we can give those three folks who were sitting here an answer, and all the car dealers around this country an answer, so we can find out when will these applications be approved. And the sooner, the better, because we are in a crisis situation on that. I also have the privilege of representing a number of recreational vehicle companies, who came to me in the last few weeks and said, ``Our funding has completely dried up.'' The people who were providing them credit for floor planning and other purposes called and said, ``We just don't have the funds anymore. There is no credit that is going to be available.'' And they said, ``Without that, how do we operate a business?'' So the next set of funds that comes along, the $350 billion, can it be put into anybody you give those funds to that they have to sign to agree to put, for every dollar they receive, at least $1 out in lending? Can that be made part of your program?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We have looked at rules such as that. And, in fact, by going with capital, if you will permit me for just a moment, many of these banks are leveraged, you know, say, 10 to one. So you put in a dollar of capital, you could get many more than a dollar of loans out the door.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","Absolutely, but we can't even get the first dollar.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Well, I think it is too soon to say that, Congressman, again, because we have an economic downturn at the same time. And so it is hard to judge how many loans would be made today had we not taken these actions.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","I understand that.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","So, going forward, we are going to continue to look at the best way to get credit flowing in our economy. You know, if you will just indulge me for a second, my phone rings off the hook. People around the country are calling me, businesses, municipalities, saying, we need help, we need help. If we took the $700 billion and went out to everybody individually, every business and every family who needs help, it wouldn't go very far. We are focusing the $700 billion on the financial system as a whole, so, by stabilizing the system, we can then get credit flowing out to everybody who needs it.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","But with $350 billion sitting there, isn't there something that can be done where we say, ``If you want these funds, you have to show us that at least an equal or more significant amount due to leverage has been loaned out?''",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","I think that is something that we can look very hard at. I don't want to overcommit, just because we haven't seen the details. But I think it is something that we can and are looking very hard at.",Speech,
"Mr. Donnelly","Well, thank you. And thank you both for your time and for hanging in there with us today.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Congressman Foster?",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Thank you again for your time. I really appreciate it. Let's see. I would also like to say that I think some of these claims that there is some sort of bait-and-switch or bamboozling going on on your part, I think, are really unwarranted. You know, the option of recapitalizing institutions was explicitly discussed during the debate. I know in my testimony in front of this committee, in my debate on the Floor before the thing was voted on, you know, this was an explicitly discussed option. And the Members who have said that somehow you have sprung this on them I think were either not paying attention to the debate or maybe not reading what was actually passed. So that is just a comment. One related thing, though, is that we made the decision in the legislation to specify preferred shares rather than real equity with voting rights. And I was wondering, in retrospect, given the problems that have arisen in trying to get the banks to directly loan out the money that we have injected into them, whether in retrospect we would have been better off following more exactly the Sweden model that this is, basically, and taking real equity stakes.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is a tough question. I don't think--in my judgement, there is not a clear answer. There are some advantages of common stock versus preferred shares, clearly. At the same time, as I spoke about earlier in the hearing, you know, we want healthy banks to volunteer for this. And if the price tag of volunteering to take more capital was more control from Washington, it is unclear that we would have thousands of banks across the country volunteering to take the capital. So there is a tension.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Okay. And the second thing, I guess for both of you, you had mentioned two metrics, the TED spread and the LIBOR-OIS spread, as ways to tell that you have really unlocked at least the interbank lending part of this thing. And there are problems with both of these as metrics. You know, the Treasury rate is being depressed by this flight to safety and so on. And I was wondering, is there really some combination of metrics that will give us a better feeling than these sort of simple things that we are talking about now?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","Yes, Congressman. I mean, actually, what we are developing is sort of a set of metrics where you can look at a number of them to draw some overall conclusions. And in addition to the ones that you mentioned, we are looking at foreclosure rates, for example, mortgage origination rates to see if there is new lending in the mortgage area. So we are going to be continuing to develop those sets of indicators. In our future 60-day reports, we expect to flesh those out more.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Okay. And then my final question is about the municipal bond market. One of the most painful aspects of the shutdown is that this is $2.7 trillion of the whole size of the market, and hundreds of billions of dollars of what would be called stimulus projects--you know, these are things that municipalities want to spend money on--are being held up by the lock-up in the municipal bond market. And I was wondering if you have any specific ideas in mind about how you might go about helping to unlock this market?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","We have a team of folks who are looking at that market specifically, everything from looking at the insurance companies that provide reinsurance on these or insurance for these--",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Have you considered recapitalizing them, for example, or allowing them to sell insurance that has a government backing of some kind?",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","There are proposals out there that we looked at in terms of recapitalizing them, proposals in terms of setting up new firms that don't have all of the tainted legacy business. There are some proposals out there on government guarantees. You know, the guarantee portion of the Troubled Asset Relief Program is we have an insurance program now. I am not sure that that would be the right vehicle to solve this problem. I think that there are a few ways you could go at it, and we do have people looking at it, because we hear the same thing you hear. It is a very important issue.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Well, it strikes me as a very high-leverage application of your funds, because these things--you know, the frustrating thing is these things have a near-zero historical default rate, and there is no reason for these not to be trading. And it is very frustrating, and it seems like there is some hope that a very limited application of recapitalization might have a huge effect.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","It is a fair point. I think we share some of those views and are just trying to look at the details, and also in light of the available TARP capacity and the other projects that we are working on. We are putting together a suite of options. But we have people who are on it.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Okay. And I just thought I would say I am tremendously impressed by both of your organizations. It is a heck of a situation we are in. And best of luck to you.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","The gentleman's time has expired. I would like to be associated with the remarks of my colleague that underscores that, from the beginning, many members of this committee and in the Joint Economic Committee called upon Treasury to recapitalize the financial system, to protect the equity of taxpayers' funds with preferred stock, and that this was an alternative or the goal of many European countries during this crisis. The number-one question that I am asked--and I would like to conclude the hearing with this. I voted for the bailout because the Secretary of the Treasury and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve said that, if we did not vote for this bailout, or this rescue plan, that we would not stabilize our markets, that we confronted a possible failure of our financial institutions, and, really, the alternative was unacceptable, and the pain and suffering of taxpayers, our constituents, and the American public would be far greater. Yet the questions that are raised at this hearing today, that are continually raised by the press, or some of the press, and by the general public is that the rescue plan was not needed. Given the advantage of your position and what you continue to do and the startling fact that one weekend we had four investment banks, at the end of the weekend there were none remaining, and the fact that some of our major and most respected banks have failed or been forced into merger, I would like to ask the most often asked question I receive, whether it is in the grocery store, on the street, or from major media. What would have happened to our great country if this Congress had not supported the President of the United States and the Secretary of the Treasury, who called upon us to react with assistance to our financial institutions? I would like both of you to respond, starting with you, Mr. Kashkari.",Speech,
"Mr. Kashkari","Congresswoman, it is a great question and very hard to answer. The best I can do is to try to give examples of what might have happened, examples I mentioned earlier. Imagine if your constituents couldn't get access to their 401(k) plans, or they couldn't get money out of their checking accounts. It is possible, if their banks were failing. Their life savings could go way down, and just a complete freezing of the basic money flow in our economy. It could grind to a halt. I mean, the downside was enormous. It is easy to make hard decisions when the consequences of inaction are so great. And I don't know what else to say other than that.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Mr. Dodaro?",Speech,
"Mr. Dodaro","The focus of our efforts has been on how the TARP program has been implemented. We haven't looked at, as I mentioned earlier, the Federal Reserve's activities, because we are really not statutorily allowed to provide that oversight. So I am really not in a position to offer an informed view in that regard. Clearly, there were risks. Clearly, there were actions taken. Clearly, there were unanticipated events. And it is just not possible for me, at this point, to analytically provide an informed view.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Well, I want to thank both of you for your testimony today and for your public service. I am deeply grateful, and I believe the American public is. So thank you very much. And, certainly, confronting the economic challenges of our country is a bipartisan--really the most critical issue that we confront in our country. I am proud of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle that supported President Bush, Secretary Paulson, the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, and many others who said, if we did not support this infusion of taxpayers' money, the consequences would have been unimaginable. Thank you for your service. Thank you for your testimony today. Our next panel consists of Elizabeth Warren, who is the Gottlieb Professor of Law, Harvard University, and Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel under the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. We welcome you today, and I have been told you were voted Chair of that oversight board. We look forward to your testimony.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Thank you, Congresswoman. Chairwoman Maloney, Members of Congress, my name is Elizabeth Warren. In my real life, I am the Leo Gottlieb Professor of Law at Harvard. Two weeks ago, I became the Chair of the Congressional Oversight Panel. Mr. Damon Silvers from the panel was here earlier, but he was called away on panel business. Mr. Neiman, who is State banking regulator for the State of New York, couldn't be with us because he is off regulating banks. And Congressman Hensarling you have heard from, and I believe he has been called away. So I am your panel for now. You know the statutory history of this panel. It is yours. The panel was given power to hold hearings, to review official data, to write reports, to review the TARP program, and to provide regulations for regulatory reform. I just want to make clear as we start, we had our first meeting literally 2 weeks ago today. So we are a committee that is now 14 days old. I don't know if that is a special anniversary, but I at least want to make sure we are clear where we are on this timeline. At this moment, we are struggling even to get temporary office space and computers, phones, and fax machines up and running. But we have met with the representatives of the Treasury Department, the Treasury Inspector General, the Federal Reserve Bank, and the GAO. We have read documents, we have requested information, and we now have two things. We have our first report to Congress, trying to meet our statutory obligations to you, and we have a Web site. We have a Web site so that we can give American people a chance to participate in our investigation and our oversight activities. In the report, which all of you now have copies of, we ask a series of questions about the TARP program. These questions are not abstract. They are not complex. They are questions much like the questions you have been asking today. We asked them publicly. We lay them out there. We publish them. They are tough questions. The questions are our best effort to capture the very real concerns and skepticisms of the American people. I will tell you just the highlights. We have 10 questions. What is Treasury's overall strategy? Is the strategy working? How are taxpayer dollars being used? Are the banks actually lending or are they holding onto this money or buying things with it? Is the public receiving a fair deal? What is the Treasury Department doing to help the American family and small businesses, thinking about the connection between, as you described it, the real economy and what is happening with banks? Is Treasury imposing reforms on financial institutions that are taking taxpayer dollars? How is Treasury deciding which institutions get these dollars? What is the scope of Treasury's statutory authority? A lawyer's question. And the final one, is Treasury looking ahead, making any effort to prepare for the next economic difficulties over the timeline of days, weeks, or months? These questions drive our first report, and they also drive our work on behalf of families, workers, small businesses, and, most importantly, taxpayers. To that end, our first priority, along with issuing this report and trying to give another frame to the questions you have been so carefully asking, is this opening a line of communication for all Americans. Today is the day our Web site goes live. It is COP, which is C-O-P for the Congressional Oversight Panel, COP.Senate.gov. It is a rudimentary site. We haven't had time to put all the bells and whistles on it. So I ask people to bear with us. But it be will a place where we can post our reports and the data that we are able to collect. More importantly, it will be a place where people can talk back. They can explain how they are experiencing the current economy, what experiences they have when they are trying to borrow money. They can discuss the questions that we pose in the report. And they can pose their own questions, telling us what answers we should seek when we ask questions in their name. We expect our oversight to be stronger and more meaningful because of the input of people across the country. As we gather more information, we will issue two more reports in January. On January 9th, the oversight panel will release its next report on the administration of the TARP program. On January 20th, the oversight panel will release a report providing recommendations for reforms to the financial regulatory structure. In other words, we will be running very hard over the next 40 days, but this is your will under the statute. As you know, recent headlines show a grim economic picture. The recession has now visited every household in this country. The unemployment rate is the highest it has been in 14 years. One in 10 homeowners is now in default or foreclosure. Retail sales continue to fall. Credit card defaults are rising. And the savings rate is hovering near zero for individual families. More than 100,000 families last month headed into the bankruptcy courts. Over the past 2 months, Congress and the Administration have proposed and enacted a series of measures in an ongoing attempt to turn the tide in this crisis. Americans are watching Washington's every move with a mixture of great hope and great concern. We hope in this time of great crisis that your Congressional Oversight Panel can be helpful. I will take your questions in any way I can.",Statement,STATEMENT OF ELIZABETH WARREN, LEO GOTTLIEB PROFESSOR OF LAW, HARVARD UNIVERSITY, AND CHAIR, CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT PANEL UNDER THE EMERGENCY ECONOMIC STABILIZATION ACT
"Mrs. Maloney","First of all, I want to thank you for your testimony and your hard work, and for assuming this critically important oversight position. As you could tell, and I noticed you were here for the entire hearing--",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Yes, ma'am.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","--many of my colleagues, including myself, were very concerned about getting credit out into the community. We appear to have stabilized our financial markets. I would like your comments on whether or not you agree that we have accomplished that goal. And could you comment on programs or ways we can get credit out into Main Street? We have helped Wall Street. What are we doing to help people buy cars, and purchase homes? I like the proposal from Treasury that they are studying of a 4.5 percent interest rate over 30 years to start moving our housing program. I would like to hear your comments on that and any other ideas about getting credit into Main Street. They testified, and we need to work on really an accounting system so that we can understand where the money is going. We have put out $7.8 trillion, and still people say that interest rates for cars are at 14 percent, which is unaffordable for most Americans, and many people cannot get mortgages for their homes with a 30-year mortgage. Could you comment on steps we need to take now?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","It would be premature for me to make specific recommendations, but I would turn to page 19 of our report. We actually had a little bit to say about this. The reminder that our friends in Great Britain faced a similar problem, and they were quite explicit up front. The money was given to financial institutions in return for the financial institutions to lend to small- and medium-sized enterprises. It was an explicit quid pro quo from the beginning. There have been measurements of what was your lending a year ago at this point and what is your lending now. Recapitalized banks, as part of their obligation in receiving funds, have to turn around and put those funds back into the economy. I mention this by way of saying that is not an entirely novel idea. It is one that has been tested somewhere else and seems to be working at least with some success. So there are ways to measure this. It is not impossible to measure what is happening to lending volume and to put metrics in to compare lending volume now with lending volume by the same bank or per dollar capitalized in the past. And this may be something that it will be appropriate to at least continue to question Treasury vigorously about.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Thank you. Debated before this committee was the wisdom of buying toxic assets. Many people believe that following the model in Great Britain of saving our financial institutions and recapitalizing was a better way to go, with preferred stock to protect taxpayers. One of the problems with buying the toxic assets is no one knows the value of them. And if no one wants to buy them, why in the world should the American taxpayer buy them? It appears to me that it would be wiser with this money to try to infuse lending and help the economy with lower car loan rates, with lower interest rates to refinance homes and to purchase homes. In other words, getting the money into the community, as opposed to buying toxic assets, that was by all accounts a mismanagement, in some cases abusive, scandalous practice that some of our financial institutions engaged in, creating and selling these assets. So could you comment on the policy of buying toxic assets? Are any of our European allies buying toxic assets during this global economic crisis?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","No, Congresswoman, but I want to actually seize on a central point that you make there. It is not possible to save banks if families and small businesses fail. The banks don't exist independently. There is no such creature. And so the idea that we focus exclusively on banks, without making this part of a more comprehensive plan to look at what is happening in the mortgage market, obviously, with foreclosures and how foreclosures are dragging down the whole economy, and what is happening in all other forms of the economic health of the American family. I recognize that Treasury has a limited portfolio. It has a limited number of dollars it can spend in targeted areas where it is authorized to spend it. Nonetheless, that is not a reason not to think through a more comprehensive way of thinking about the question of how we will make sure not just that credit flows to the American family and to small businesses, but that they are healthy, that they actually have an opportunity to borrow at reasonable rates, but that they also have manageable economic lives. If they do not, we cannot save banks without saving these families and businesses. I really want to emphasize that tie-in. I heard that in your question.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Well, thank you very much. My time has expired. Congressman Mel Watt.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you for being here, Professor Warren. Let me just ask a couple of technical questions first. I noticed that Representative Hensarling is on this oversight committee. I assume he is not going to be working at this full-time. Are any of the members of this oversight committee planning to do this full-time or is this a part-time job?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Congressman Watt, I was told explicitly that this is a part-time job. And I believe that was the case for the other members of the committee.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Then that raises the second question I have, is the extent to which this can be really taken seriously. So let me ask the question this way. We didn't seem to get many concrete responses to our inquiries as Members of Congress today. Have you all discussed what I anticipate will be a problem, what you will do if you don't get concrete answers to the questions that you have posed about this program?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Well, Congressman, as I see it, this panel is-- we work for you, and if we don't get the answers we need--",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Statutorily, what authority do you have to insist on being taken seriously and on getting the kinds of answers to the questions that you have raised?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Statutorily we can hold hearings and we can make requests. Otherwise, we can only come and talk to you.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Subpoena power?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I don't believe so.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","Okay. All right. On page 35 of your report you talk about some things, future oversight activities, and the final one of those is public participation and comment process. Let me ask whether you open the possibility there of this being simply a popularity contest, a public opinion poll, or, again in the context of being taken seriously as a serious oversight body, I hope we are not setting up a structure where basically people have the opportunity to vent about their pet peeves about the program as opposed to making a concrete effort to make the program work. What did you have in mind when you proposed this public participation and comment process?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","It is my understanding that Treasury said the one thing we need is more confidence. We need confidence so that the American people can believe we are back on the right track, that money is being spent in a responsible way, and that we can all get out there and do our jobs and borrow and buy and pay debt off and try to stabilize ourselves financially.",Speech,
"Mr. Watt","That is all very good, but if the bulk of the oversight board's responsibility is to take and assess public comments, I can tell you I love public comments, I have an open phone policy in my office, so I probably get more of them than most people do, but it is very time-consuming and not always as substantive as--you know, people like to vent, and they will use this as an opportunity. So I want to make sure that the bulk of the oversight board's time is not being spent doing public relations as opposed to serious evaluation and analysis of what the Treasury and this Administration and the next Administration are doing with these funds as opposed to, you know, just kind of making people feel good, which serves an important purpose, but I would like--I think Congress viewed this as more a substantive role than a public opinion outreach process. So I will just leave you with that. That is not a criticism. I am just giving you a real concern that I have. And it probably doesn't even require a comment, but my time has expired and I will yield back.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","The Chair recognizes Congressman Miller from North Carolina. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you. Professor Warren, I earlier asked Mr. Kashkari about AIG, and to a lesser extent about Citigroup, but my questions have to go more broadly to transparency and accountability, the whole program, whether the American people really know how their money is being spent and whether it is being spent for a proper purpose. Mr. Kashkari said several times in his testimony that he believed that AIG would return--was viable, would return to profitability or solvency at least, and that we would get all of our money back. But when I asked about what kind of due diligence there had been, what we knew about the financial condition of the parent, the holding company, which seems to be where all the problems were, there wasn't a regulator to provide us any information at all. And he said there were two reasons for the companies that got the TARP funds. One was that they were viable, that they were healthy, that they could use the money to lend and encourage other economic activity; and then second is systemic risk. And it appears that AIG is all about systemic risk. That if they disappeared as a counterparty in derivative contracts and credit default swaps, which is a derivative contract, that there were lots of other financial institutions that would be out a lot. And it was really about helping them, not maintaining AIG as a viable business, that we intervened in AIG. I asked him about the financial institutions that were the counterparties. And he said essentially that we didn't know exactly who they were. Is that credible? Do you know who they were? And do you think we should know?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I do think we should know. AIG must have records on to whom this money was paid, who the counterparties were. Now, I want to be fair, sometimes they are held in street names. It is not always entirely, entirely clear, but one can certainly make an inquiry in the initial transaction. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Can you make that inquiry? Have you made that inquiry?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Yes, sir. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Will you make that inquiry?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","We will make that inquiry. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. The money that we have distributed, the capital infusion we have gotten something from. We were told, Congress was told, and we told the American people this was not a giveaway, this was a reluctant loan, it was an investment, and we meant to get our money back. If AIG is not realistically viable, if they are never going to return to solvency, if the real reason we are doing it is to pay off these credit default swaps, these derivatives, that feels like a giveaway. Should we be getting something from the businesses that are getting paid on derivative contracts?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","They certainly are profiting from our money, and I think it is an appropriate inquiry. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. As to Citigroup, I know that there was a regulator that we could rely upon for Citigroup, but the regulator initially urged $25 billion, and then 2 weeks after Secretary Paulson said that all the major financial institutions were now okay, there would be no others that would collapse, we had another one of those fevered weekends where we tried to strike a deal before the Asian markets opened and put another $20 billion into Citigroup and guaranteed $306 billion in troubled assets. Do you know what the assets were and why were they troubled?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","No, I do not. We will be asking. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. I yield back the balance of my time.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","I thank the gentleman, and would like to note as to his question at the last hearing Chairman Bernanke said he would submit to this committee the counterparties for the AIG money. He also testified that in the swaps there are two types, one with assets, one that is basically just gambling, and that we should not in any way be, in my opinion, rewarding gambling. But he said there was no way for a distinction between those two--yes. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Actually, I do have one more question. I know that I yielded back, but I would unyield. Do we know if AIG has stopped the business of writing derivative contracts or credit default swaps where no party to the transaction has an interest in the underlying asset?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","No, Congressman, we don't know that. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. There is no readily apparent social utility for that practice, at least to me. One of the tasks of your oversight panel is to look at reforming business. Do you see any value in their writing credit default swaps or other derivative contracts on--",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","The gentleman's time has expired, but please respond, Professor Warren.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I have a great deal of difficulty understanding the social utility of a credit default swap when there is no underlying transaction for which either party has any connection, any financial connection. I want to be educated in this area, but I confess to deep skepticism. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Okay. Can you find out if they are still doing it?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","We certainly will. I will put it on the list. Mr. Miller of North Carolina. Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Thank you, Congressman.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","And a further follow up is should taxpayers' money be spent for basically gambling on something that has no underlying asset? The Chair recognizes Mr. Cleaver for 5 minutes.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman. Thank you, Professor, for being here. And it has been a long day for you.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","It has.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","When we designed the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act, we expanded the scope of the definition for financial institutions, and it was my interpretation of that expansion that we went beyond traditional banks, beyond credit unions. And I believed at the time that the bill had been drafted to include the automobile financing arms. In my district, I have two automobile manufacturing plants. It makes no difference if they have capital to continue to operate if no one is buying the cars. I know in your role, and I am thankful, as I hope all Americans are, for your service and your willingness to serve in this capacity at a time like this, but I am somewhat disappointed, and hopefully as you look at this through the Oversight Committee that you would seek to determine whether or not, in providing oversight, that attention is being given to what I think is rather explicit in the language of the legislation. Is it your understanding about the expansion of the definition, the scope of the definition?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I have to say at this moment, Congressman, that this is one of the questions we have addressed. I think members of the panel may have very different views on this. But it is certainly a question we will be exploring. And that is the best I can do at this moment. We have only been here 14 days.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","No, I understand. I appreciate it.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","But I very much hear your point.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Yes.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I want you to know I am hearing.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you. I don't want to overstate it.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","No.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","I am just very, very concerned about what is going on with regard to the financing arms.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","I understand.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","If they don't finance the purchase of a car, we are in trouble. And most people right now can't get it. I have a friend who sells cars. He has been told, don't even submit an application of a score under 700.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Wow. That is a very high number.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","And GMAC admitted to me that is exactly where they are.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Yes, Congressman. I certainly hear the point.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Thank you.",Speech,
"Mr. Cleaver","Thank you, Madam Chairwoman.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Thank you. We have been called for a vote. So the last question will be Congressman Foster.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Thank you for hanging around for this. And I would like to say these are spectacular questions. You know, if the quality of the questions coming from this committee were a fifth the quality of these, I would be proud to be a Congressman. And let's see, one question, is the staffing situation and the support you are getting adequate for your job?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Wonderful. We have received terrific support from the people here in Congress. It is literally just a problem of we were trying to write the report at the same time we were trying to buy the fax machine. You know, I feel like I am flying an airplane and trying to screw the wings on at the same moment.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","No complaints there. And you anticipate sunsetting this when the actual--when everything gets done, right? And so this will be the same time scale of the savings and loan bailout, it will be a decade if we are lucky?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","No, Congressman, I have not committed to a decade of this. As I understand it, by statute we expire, our panel expires in June of 2010. So we have about a year-and-a- half with you.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","Okay. And are you going to get into the business of unwinding the securitization of the mortgage-backed securities? Because I see you have a lot of volunteer labor from Harvard law students. And if there was ever a need for bright new ideas, it seems like that is an issue that, you know, ideas would be appreciated in. And I guess that is just a comment. And then finally, your last question was the future and are they actually looking forward. I understand that they are still putting out fires right now. But you know, one of the things that occurs to me is that there is a significant downside risk that people don't like to talk about. You know, it is quite possible that real estate values are going to fall another factor of two. That is not inconsistent with historical values. And so I understand why Treasury would not be talking about this publicly, but I would be interested in some assurance that you can give us, either privately or publicly, that Treasury is actually looking at and planning for scenarios of how they might look at a significant downturn if really things, you know, things like the bottom drops out of the real estate market or other things. That at least--I would feel good to know that there are smart people thinking about that, even if they are not talking about it publicly. In the same sense you would like to see, you know, defense against terrorists thought about in great detail by smart people. And so that is one of the things I would appreciate your looking into.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Yes, Congressman, we will be.",Speech,
"Mr. Foster","I yield back.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","In line with the gentleman's question, would you comment on the proposal that Treasury is considering of 30- year long-term loans at 4.5 percent interest rate for first- time home buyers to shore up the housing market, housing values as a response to the concerns that the gentleman raised?",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Congresswoman, I just want to make this point about it. This looks like a very promising idea. But we cannot keep taking slices of approaches here. This, for example, will do nothing to help people who are losing their homes in foreclosure. And so you cannot refinance a house that is now at 130 percent of loan-to-value ratio. You just can't do it. And so--",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Reclaiming my time--",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Of course.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","--as you heard in the hearing, a number of us are legislating that TARP money be used to support activities such as Sheila Bair, who is the Commissioner of the FDIC. She successfully saved many homeowners in the IndyMac situation. Citibank also is adopting her policies. So in conjunction, obviously, you heard we are going to legislate, requiring them to move with TARP money to help renegotiate these loans into long-term lower interest loans, as proposed by FDIC Chairwoman Sheila Bair.",Speech,
"Ms. Warren","Yes. I should add, I understand that there is also at least on the table the possibility of amending the bankruptcy laws to provide for strip-down of these mortgages that are badly underwater. It is going to take a comprehensive solution and that no one--it is not even appropriate, in my view, to think about this as a one-piece. We have to think about the housing market together. Foreclosures and accelerating foreclosures are obviously, in my view, the huge driving problem right now. Then we have to think about the housing market in the context of the declining economic health of the American family. And until we think in a more comprehensive way we can't create solutions that will really make a difference. We end up pushing a little here, and then it squeezes out over there or it creates a different kind of problem. So I don't mean to be resistant on the news about supporting 4.5 percent mortgages, but I think we have to be very careful about thinking about where we want to spend our money and who will be the primary beneficiaries of being able to refinance their current mortgages or to buy new houses at 4.5 percent versus the resources we may need to spend to deal with foreclosures. So it is only to make the point of the importance of a comprehensive solution.",Speech,
"Mrs. Maloney","Well, I agree completely. Sheila Bair has asked for $25 billion. Many of us have supported her request. She believes she can keep 1.5 million people in their homes. But then there are many more that we must address. We are called to a vote. We have 5 minutes to vote. So I will be thanking you very much for your testimony today, and I would like to note that some members may have additional questions for the panel, which they may wish to submit in writing. Without objection, the hearing record will remain open for 30 days for members to submit written questions to Professor Warren and to place her responses in the record. The hearing is adjourned.",Speech,
